Disarming Egypt &apos;s Militarized State 
LONDON - Egypt &apos;s crisis has been called the worst in its history . 
In fact , it bears a striking resemblance to a previous episode , almost 60 years ago . 
On February 28 , 1954 , more than a 100,000 protesters besieged Cairo &apos;s Abdin Palace , then being used by Gamal Abdel Nasser and other leaders of the July 1952 coup . 
The protesters &quot; main demands were the restoration of Egypt &apos;s fragile democratic institutions , the release of political prisoners , and the army &apos;s return to its barracks . 
The two-month crisis of 1954 was sparked by the removal of Egypt &apos;s president , General Mohammed Naguib , by Nasser and his faction . 
As in 2013 , the Muslim Brotherhood was at the center of events , mobilizing on the side of the deposed Naguib . 
But , following Nasser &apos;s promises to hold elections in June 1954 and to hand over power to civilians , one of the Brotherhood &apos;s leaders , Abd al-Qadr Audeh , dismissed the protesters . 
Nasser &apos;s promises were empty , and by November his faction was victorious . 
Naguib remained under house arrest , leftist workers were executed and liberals terrorized . 
Audeh was arrested , and , in January 1955 , he and five Brotherhood leaders were executed . 
Egypt lost its basic freedoms and democratic institutions for more than a half-century , until February 11 2011 , when Hosni Mubarak was overthrown . 
The similarities between February-March 1954 and June-July 2013 are numerous . 
In both crises , zero-sum behavior and rhetoric , mobilization and counter-mobilization by a divided public , and deception by ( and manipulation of ) the media were the order of the day . 
More worrying are the similarities in potential outcomes . 
In 1954 , a junta that regarded itself as being above the state destroyed weak democratic order ; that outcome is highly probable now as well . 
Differences exist , though . 
In 1954 , the conflict was wider than a power struggle between a president and a junta ; it was also a battle over who would determine Egypt &apos;s future and the relationship between civilian and military institutions . 
Surprisingly , the army back then was split between officers who wanted a civilian-led democracy and others who wanted a military-led autocracy . 
In the first camp lay Khaled Mohyiddin , Ahmad Shawky , Yusuf Siddiq , and others . 
Naguib played along . 
The second camp was led by Nasser and the majority of the junta represented in the Revolutionary Command Council . 
The Brotherhood &apos;s relationship with Egypt &apos;s officers is the result of a few critical events , including the 1954 demonstrations and now the 2013 coup . 
Bloodshed , particularly Nasser &apos;s execution of Brotherhood leaders , increased the bitterness . 
In June 1957 , moreover , Nasser &apos;s security forces allegedly opened fire on Brotherhood members in their prison cells , killing 21 and wounding hundreds . 
A Brotherhood intellectual , Sayyid Qutb , started theorizing about a binary world in which the forces of good ( Party of God ) would inevitably clash with the forces of evil ( Party of Satan ) . 
His writings led directly to his execution in August 1966 . 
The consequences of the events of 2013 , like the consequences of that Cairo prison massacre in 1957 , may not be recognized quickly . 
But , once elected officials are removed by force , the outcomes are rarely favorable for democracy . 
In case after case - for example , Spain in 1936 , Iran in 1953 , Chile in 1973 , Turkey in 1980 , Sudan in 1989 , and Algeria in 1992 - the results were tragic : military domination of politics with a civilian fa√ßade , outright military dictatorship , civil war , or persistent civil unrest . 
Moreover , the military in 2013 has gained more power than the 1954 junta : not just arms and control of state institutions , but also crowds and media cheering for more repression . 
And , unlike in 1954 , the army is not divided ( at least not yet ) . 
But supporters of the deposed president , Mohamed Morsi , are not without their own sources of power . 
Their mobilization capacity is high . 
Last Friday , Cairo was paralyzed , despite an almost-complete lack of coverage by local media outlets . 
And Ramadan - now underway - is mobilization-friendly . 
After sunset , there is a common program . 
Observant Muslims gather at sundown for iftar ( breakfast ) , followed by evening prayers , tawarih ( longer prayers , including a short sermon ) , social interactions , qiyyam ( another late-night prayer ) , suhur ( another collective meal ) , and then morning prayers . 
The last ten days of Ramadan are i &apos;tikaf ( collective seclusion ) , during which worshippers gather and spend nights in mosques and open areas . 
Overall , the socio-religious culture of Ramadan can help keep the Brotherhood &apos;s mobilization of its supporters alive for a while . 
This brings us to the junta &apos;s tactics to force demobilization . 
Since 2011 , the army &apos;s principal strategy has been to make promises and issue threats , which are enforced by shooting live rounds and / or tear gas . 
These tactics were used , for example , against Christian demonstrators in October 2011 ( 28 dead , 212 injured ) , non-Islamist pro-revolution youth in November 2011 ( 51 dead , more than 1,000 injured ) , and again in December 2011 ( seven dead ) . 
The July 2013 massacre was by far the worst ( 103 deaths so far and more than 1,000 injured ) . 
The army &apos;s goal was not only to intimidate Morsi &apos;s supporters , but also to disrupt their calculations . 
The junta wants its responses to remain unpredictable and to demonstrate its willingness to use extreme violence . 
But such tactics during Ramadan can be problematic , given the potential negative reaction of junior army officers and ordinary soldiers . 
Any resolution to the current crisis should aim to save the remnants of the only gains made so far in Egypt &apos;s revolution : basic freedoms and democratic institutions . 
That will require ceasing violent repression , stopping propaganda and incitement in pro-junta media and pro-Morsi protests , and trust-building measures . 
A credible guarantor , possibly the Obama administration , needs to be heavily involved in this process , given the absence of trust among Egypt &apos;s main political actors ; indeed , every institution is politicized and willing to cheat if it can . 
Finally , a referendum on any final deal is essential . 
In short , the credibility of ballots and democracy must be restored in Egypt ( and throughout the region ) ; bullets and violence must not be allowed to rule .
