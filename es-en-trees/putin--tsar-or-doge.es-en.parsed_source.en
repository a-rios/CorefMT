Putin : Tsar or Doge ? 
Two practical questions can be asked of any political system : First , what distinguishes the political parties ? 
Second , who is in charge ? 
For a while in postcommunist Russia , the answers were blindingly clear : parties were divided between those nostalgic for Soviet times and those who wanted reform . 
Who was in charge ? 
The president . 
After twelve years of transition , the answer to the first question has blurred . 
With the Communist Party in terminal decline , ideologies are vanishing . 
Indeed , anybody hoping for an obvious clash of left and right during the recent presidential election campaign was bound to be disappointed , because the answer to the second question is even more emphatic today : President Putin &apos;s re-election was never in doubt . 
This president is very much in charge . 
Putin &apos;s all-encompassing popularity , which is genuine , and his blurring of all political dividing lines has given him an unassailable position . 
Many bemoan this state of affairs , but his ascendancy might be less malign than it seems . 
Russia &apos;s size , the poverty of its infrastructure , and the disarray of its bureaucracy limit Putin &apos;s power . 
Within those limits , he uses his power relentlessly . 
Sufficient unto themselves behind the Kremlin &apos;s walls , Putin and his officials rule in ways more arbitrary and opaque than would be tolerated in a true democracy . 
The impression Putin &apos;s presidency creates is of autocracy punctuated by elections . 
Autocracy , not dictatorship . 
After four years of a presidency supposedly devoted to forging a &quot; dictatorship of law , &quot; the rule of law in Russia remains weak and property rights ill defined . 
A solid middle class has yet to emerge , nor a resilient civil society . 
Privatisation of state assets has done much for the economy , but has also been used for patronage and empire building . 
The army does not appear to be reliably under civilian control , and the brutal war in Chechnya festers . 
So Putin &apos;s authoritarianism creeps along , but by Russian standards it is far from being hideously creepy . 
In some things , indeed , he deserves the thanks of all Russians . 
He has consigned the Communists to Trotsky &apos;s dustbin of history . 
Now splintering , some seem willing to stop pandering to Bolshevik ghosts . 
That is good for Russia . 
Welcome to the republic . 
Putin has also not turned the clock back on economic reform . 
Indeed , the economy has mostly boomed under his stewardship - another reason ordinary Russians like him . 
Where Putin has failed is in fostering democratic governance . 
The question is not just whether he and his ex-KGB cronies muzzle the media and jail their opponents . 
No , the real flaw in Putin &apos;s rule is that his power is personal , not based on the support of a political party . 
The central issue in Russian politics is not the battle for votes . 
More significant by far is the competition for power that takes place in the bowels of the presidency . 
Barely discernible most of the time , only brief flashes illuminate the battle , as when Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested . 
The emergence of viable political parties requires a strong parliament . 
At best , it is a safety valve for democracy rather than an engine of it . 
Of course , there is a big pro-presidential majority party in the Duma . 
What he wants , it votes for . 
Because Putin cannot stomach opposition , he stifles the growth of parties . 
Here he gets a helping hand from party politicians , because the reformist parties inspire little confidence . 
A pessimist surveying last December &apos;s Duma election , with its futile party politics , bitterness , and invective , might compare Russia to Weimar Germany . 
The reformist &quot; Union of Right Forces , &quot; led by Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais , destroyed itself last December , failing to gain a seat in the Duma . 
The URF leaders ran an electoral campaign that seemed to revel in their distance from ordinary Russians . 
Instead of visiting Russians struggling to manage their difficult lives , Nemtsov and Chubais touted themselves as modern men flying about in private jets and fiddling with laptops . 
Tin political ears deserve defeat . 
Compounding the problem of party formation is personal rivalry . 
Grigory Yavlinsky seems to think he is Charles de Gaulle , waiting at his dacha version of de Gaulle &apos;s home in Colombey for a summons to power . 
His ego alone kept his Yabloko Party from cooperating with the Union of Right Forces . 
Putin understands instinctively that Russia needs elements of democracy , if only to distinguish the new Russia from the old , and to let the odd gust of healthy fresh air in . 
Unchallenged in his second and last term , will he retain even that slight democratic instinct ? 
The talk today in Russia is of &quot; Putinism , &quot; which professes democracy without as yet obliging the state to accept the disciplines of a truly democratic system . 
But the French have an older word for Putinism : Ã©tatisme , which holds that the state commands society rather than serves it . 
This does not imply that a government must rule by fear , as past Russian governments did : in this respect , Putin &apos;s government is as good as any Russia has ever had . 
But a &quot; Putinist &quot; government won &apos;t have much time for openness , debate , or accountability .
