Should Shareholders Be Kings ? 
The story takes place in France , in Belgium , and in Luxemburg . 
But it is really a pan-European story , and in economic terms it encompasses the entire world . 
Mittal , the biggest steelmaker in the world , has successfully gained control of Arcelor , the second biggest , through what initially was a hostile takeover bid . 
This is no mere corporate takeover ; it is a conflict between business and social models . 
Arcelor , originally French and Luxemburguese but now predominantly Belgian , has a strong base in Brazil and operates throughout much of the world . 
It specializes in high-quality , special steel products designed for the most complicated uses . 
These high-quality products are purchased on middle- and long-term contracts , mainly by long-time customers . 
Arcelor , one of the oldest steel manufacturers in the world , depends very little on the highly speculative world market for raw steel , and its workforce is ( on average ) highly qualified and stable . 
Mittal , by contrast , is a conglomerate that has come out of nowhere to become the world &apos;s leading steel company in a mere two decades . 
It did so by brilliantly consolidating and rationalizing steel plants throughout the world . 
Its president is Indian , but it has no factory in India . 
Mittal is mainly based in Eastern Europe , but also has a strong presence in Asia ( South Korea ) and Latin America . 
Mittal is a strong but fragile company , for it is highly subject to the speculative waves of the global market for raw steel . 
It tightens costs , and outsources work as much as possible , so its workforce is paid less than Arcelor &apos;s employees and is less stable . 
Moreover , Arcelor represented a perfect takeover target : most of its capital belongs to diverse shareholders . 
The opposite is true of Mittal , where the Lakshmi Mittal and his family own more than 60 % of the shares . 
This explains why Mittal &apos;s shares are traded in Amsterdam , one of the few stock markets in the world that allows for the listing of companies with so little free-floating capital . 
Thus , there is no reciprocity : Mittal could bid for Arcelor , but Arcelor could not bid for Mittal . 
The stakes are much clearer than they usually are in these types of battles . 
Mittal has an obvious interest in gaining control of Arcelor in order to improve its global geographic balance , boost its market share in high-end steel products , and reduce its vulnerability to the speculative jolts that occur in the raw steel market . 
Conversely , Arcelor has absolutely no interest in the success of this takeover . 
If it is led into a more adventurous strategy , its sustained policy of research and heavy investment in up-market steel products may be weakened . 
Its workforce stands to suffer , slowly but surely , from erosion of its relative advantages in terms of wages and job security . 
This explains why the management , most of the workers , and the Unions of Arcelor refused Mittals offer . 
But the shareholders of Arcelor have made their choice . 
The immediate profit offered by Mittal was enough . 
Mittal won . 
So the shareholders chose to cash in on a temporary bonus , taking a risk on the progressive erosion of the firm , and perhaps the end of its policy of focusing on high quality while treating its workers with respect . 
There are very few fixed-term contracts or part-time contracts in Arcelor . 
This choice directly concerns more than 150,000 employees . 
Indirectly , it concerns all of us , for the choice made by Arcelor &apos;s shareholders is far from being an exception ; on the contrary , it reveals the deep economic and social significance of corporate takeovers of this type . 
Where are our societies headed if company owners consider that quality is too expensive and that workers must be made insecure in order to make them less demanding ? 
A system governed by such rules is prone to give rise to various social conflicts , and perhaps to violence . 
Above all , such a system is neither viable nor sustainable in the long run . 
For this reason , it is dangerous to maintain the outdated legal concept according to which a company belongs only to its owners or shareholders . 
Indeed , in reality , the company is a community of men and women who draw their incomes from the same economic and technical venture . 
It would be prudent to adapt the law to this state of facts , and to give employees , too , a say in their destiny . 
In the wake of Mittal &apos;s takeover of Arcelor , governments must address this gap in the law , as no society can afford to permit the economic system to continue its march toward indifference to the welfare and security of workers .
