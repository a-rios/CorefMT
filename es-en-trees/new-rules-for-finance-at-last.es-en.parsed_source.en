New Rules for Finance At Last 
PARIS - The World Monetary and Economic Conference took place in London 76 years ago , in June 1933 , with 66 countries meeting to put an end to the unfolding monetary disorder and trade wars while trying to draw the lessons of the Great Depression . 
When it was over , the negotiators admitted failure . 
On April 2 , 2009 , world leaders will head to London again to find a solution to a financial and economic crisis as dire as that of 1929 . 
We cannot let history repeat itself . 
If collective inaction prevails , we risk a return to the political and economic woes of the 1930 &quot; s , which paved the way to a devastating world conflict . 
Of course , we must respond to both the weakening economy and financial instability in a virtual state of emergency . 
This is why stimulus packages and financial rescue plans were for the first time adopted concomitantly in Europe , the United States , and some large Asian countries . 
At the G-20 finance ministers meeting on March 14 , all of our countries did their best and made massive efforts to repair their economic machinery as fast as possible . 
The policies chosen are different , but all states favor solutions that seem most appropriate to them . 
All are daring and realistic regarding the tasks that await us . 
Like its partners , France has launched significant stimulus measures , with a plan announced by President Nicolas Sarkozy last December , as well as public investments and early repayment of government debt . 
If we also take into account the strengthening of social services and legal policies launched last month , France &apos;s stimulus in 2009 totals more than 2 % of its GDP , with committed future outflows equaling the US . 
Moreover , the impact of automatic stabilizers - which enable the government to mobilize more or less fiscal resources , depending on economic conditions - is more powerful in Western Europe than in most of the Anglo-Saxon countries . 
Yet America &apos;s macroeconomic situation seems worse than Europe &apos;s in terms of consumption , banking , or employment and housing markets . 
But , as both Sarkozy and US President Barack Obama have insisted , we must go further . 
Economic stimulus will work efficiently only if confidence is restored . 
We obviously need to strike at the root of the problem , which requires us to redefine the basic principles of the system . 
It would be counterproductive to focus on treating the symptoms , only to realize later that the unprecedented budgets for structural policies are neither economically efficient nor politically acceptable . 
At the Washington Summit last November , the EU suggested a basic principle : all markets , all territories , and all actors putting the global financial system at risk should be monitored . 
This principle , to which all agreed , must be enforced even if it upsets old habits and comfortable incomes . 
I am especially convinced that we must closely monitor actors in financial markets such as hedge funds . 
Although hedge funds sometimes account for 50 % of market transactions , they are not registered or subject to rules on transparency . 
This is not sustainable . 
Fighting for transparency also implies confronting states that refuse to collaborate on financial issues at a global level or to combat money laundering or prevent financial risks . 
We cannot build a safer system if we do not raise global requirements and if we tolerate non-compliance with the rules . 
Together with Germany , France intends to draw up a list of uncooperative countries and to design a tool kit of appropriate sanctions . 
New auditing standards must reflect an overhauled financial architecture that focuses on transparency . 
The aim of such standards must be to attenuate the impact of financial failure , not amplify it , as has occurred in the crisis . 
Indeed , the rating agencies , whose malfunctions contributed to the crisis , must be regulated . 
We demand an easy policy : stricter rules ( especially when fighting conflicts of interest ) , a specific rating scale for complex products , and regular publication of their returns . 
Europe followed this path when preparing , under the recent French presidency , a European regulation that will soon be adopted . 
We expect all of our partners to do the same . 
Responsibility must be put back at the heart of a system that has sunk into excess . 
The methods used to pay market operators reflected our collective mistakes . 
We yielded to short-term incentives , and everything seemed to conspire to push us to accepting excessive risks . 
We must revise compensation schemes and delay bonus payments until the long-term profitability of a firm &apos;s investments is known . 
Finally , we must express our solidarity for emerging and poor countries . 
Weakened by this crisis , they are the first to suffer from the cuts in financial flows . 
The international financial institutions must support them massively , and also have the resources needed to foresee global unbalances and prevent crises , rather than respond only when events become urgent . 
France and its European partners , in particular Germany , with which we worked in tight collaboration , will suggest all these points to the G-20 . 
Indeed , just as a national fiscal stimulus is less efficient than a coordinated effort , strengthening financial regulations without combating the laxity that prevails elsewhere makes no sense in a globalized world . 
We should not delude ourselves ; we cannot solve all the problems of this crisis in the coming days . 
We must , however , reach several objectives and give clear signs of a true collective ambition . 
History has shown how risky it is to miss some opportunities . 
On April 2 , France and Europe will be present .
