The Sunflower Revolutionary 
LONDON - The grim news that Ai Weiwei , perhaps China &apos;s most famous contemporary artist , has been arrested and jailed - his family and friends have not seen or heard from him since - makes me think anew about Ai &apos;s 100 million hand-painted porcelain sunflower seeds , now being exhibited at London &apos;s Tate Modern Gallery . 
China &apos;s people , Ai &apos;s installation seems to imply , are like the millions of seeds spread across the Tate &apos;s gargantuan entrance hall . 
No one cares whether they are humiliated or crushed under foot ( as the seeds were allowed to be at the exhibition &apos;s opening ) . 
Unfortunately , Ai has become one of the seeds , his freedom crushed by the heel of an inhuman state . 
The Chinese official newspaper Global Times denounces Ai as a &quot; maverick , &quot; and mavericks are not tolerated in China . 
The only way for a Chinese individual to survive is to adopt the grey , anonymous way of the sunflower seed . 
According to a short item published by the official Xinhua news agency , Ai has allegedly been involved in so-called &quot; economic crimes , &quot; which could mean practically anything that the Marxist / Maoist minds of the leadership care to dream up . 
In fact , China &apos;s government has yet to decide whether to prosecute Ai for economic crimes or for being &quot; maverick . &quot; 
Either way , the outside world must not be allowed to have any idea as to what fate awaits Ai . 
But the true reason for Ai &apos;s arrest is obvious . 
When the police stormed Ai &apos;s workshop , they demanded that Ai &apos;s wife , Lu Qing , tell them , &quot; What did Ai write on the Internet ? &quot; 
In the Chinese government &apos;s view , an artist who dares to speak for the &quot; sunflower seeds &quot; and cultivate an independent mind is a direct security threat . 
He must be put under control , silenced . 
Of course , the ruling Chinese Communist Party is prefabricating Ai &apos;s prosecution . 
It is as if three decades after China &apos;s &quot; opening , &quot; nothing has changed in the Party &apos;s way of thinking and ruling . 
Ai graduated from the Beijing Film Academy in 1978 , but he learned and developed his artistic talents in the United States . 
His Shanghai workshop used to be a salon for Chinese artists , including the film directors Chen Kaige and Jiang Wen . 
Instead , he remained an outspoken , independent man , ready to speak and take action whenever art and ideals confronted repression and cruelty . 
With China &apos;s regime now gripped by fear of an Arab-style revolution , the government has chosen repression as the only means to &quot; maintain stability . &quot; 
On the day of Ai &apos;s arrest , former Global Times journalist Wen Tao was grabbed off the street in broad daylight . 
Before that , the writers Ran Yunfei , Teng Biao , Ye Du , Zhu Yufu , Tang Jingling , Gu Chuan , Li Hai , Ding Mao , Chen Wei , Jiang Tianyong , and Liu Zhengqing were separately detained or sentenced to jail . 
Other young Beijing artists have been detained as well . 
To be sure , the regime considers Ai &apos;s arrest a preemptive measure to prevent the outbreak of public demonstrations . 
The next targets will likely be independent writers like Ai Xiaoming , Dai Qing , Cui Weiping , and Han Han . 
The regime will not stop the persecution until the only voices to be heard are its own &quot; official &quot; artists . 
Ai &apos;s arrest and disappearance , along with the severe prison sentence imposed on the Noble Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo , are driven by the same motivation : to dam the potential for political unrest and purge independent intellectuals . 
This process is nothing new . 
The writer Li Hong received a six-year prison sentence and died in a hospital under police supervision last year . 
Another writer , Li Xianbin , was sentenced to 10 years . 
According to the Writers in Prison Committee of the Independent Chinese PEN Center , more than 30 of the country &apos;s writers are currently locked up . 
China &apos;s relentless economic rise is bringing with it a decadence of civilization . 
The feast of new wealth is accompanied by a famine of morality . 
So when global leaders behave like conniving hucksters to do business with this new China &apos;s rulers , they betray the values and principles that are the basis of democracy . 
Ai used to argue that the Chinese regime &apos;s despotism is boosted by shameless liars . 
He always understood that true art and politics can never march hand-in-hand . 
They must eventually confront each other on the field of a free conscience . 
The &quot; Arab awakening &quot; tells something else about those sunflower seeds at the Tate Modern : the seeds , once they come together , show their unity and power . 
That is the other lesson that Ai wanted his audiences to understand , and it is why his spirit and message cannot be crushed : there are 1.3 billion seeds with him .
