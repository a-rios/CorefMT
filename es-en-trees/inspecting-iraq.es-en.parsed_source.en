Inspecting Iraq 
The UN weapons inspectors are now at work in Iraq , trying to determine how many weapons of mass destruction have been developed in the last four years . 
If the track record of previous inspections holds true , Iraq will not come clean , and the inspectors will have to work their way through a maze of deception and distortion . 
In 1991 , a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) visited Tarmiya to check out rumors that the site was part of Iraq &apos;s nuclear weapons program . 
According to Dr. Abdul-Qadir Ahmed , the Iraqi official in charge that day , the huge magnets attached to giant spools of copper wire were simply part of the maintenance equipment for Iraq &apos;s power stations . 
How else could Iraq have managed to put its power stations back in production after the Gulf War ? 
The inspectors looked over the huge winding machine and concluded that there were really no grounds for the rumors . 
At the same time , however , a defector was telling a different story to US intelligence . 
Having been refused permission to transfer out of the clandestine nuclear weapons program , Dr. Ibrahim Bawi had put his family in his government-supplied car and driven north . 
He wound up at the American Air Force base in Incirlik in southern Turkey . 
From there , he was whisked to the US to begin his debriefing . 
Soon thereafter , the inspectors returned to Tarmiya . 
This time , they knew exactly what the huge magnets were for : to produce weapons grade nuclear materials . 
This time , Dr. Ahmed , the Iraqi counterpart , realized the game was up . 
Some of the inspectors he knew well , having dined with them on collegial terms during visits to Vienna . 
That he would lie to them so brazenly was incomprehensible to his friends on the inspection team . 
Nothing personal , he told them , he was under orders . 
The word had come down : a lie under orders is not a lie , it is just following orders . 
In fact , the much-touted accomplishments of both the IAEA and UN inspectors came only after major defections from within the Iraqi weapons program and a lot of follow-up by the inspection teams . 
Though the teams were staffed by capable weapons experts on loan from their governments , it still took four years to force Iraq to admit to conducting a biological weapons program . 
Only the 1995 defection of Saddam &apos;s son-in-law , Hussein Kamel , brought definitive proof of the existence of Iraq &apos;s huge nuclear weapons program . 
Hans Blix , the director of the new inspections effort , has been fooled twice before by the Iraqis . 
In 1990 , before Iraq &apos;s invasion of Kuwait , he declared that there was no nuclear weapon &apos;s program in Iraq . 
In 1994 , Blix accepted the Iraqi story that there was no real nuclear weapon program , only a small research effort . 
The huge Iraqi uranium enrichment program was only meant to produce fuel for future nuclear power stations . 
Of course , the story changed after Hussein Kamel &apos;s defection . 
The problem now is that Kamel was the last major defector to come out of Iraq . 
None of the inspections or gadgetry can match the value of an insider who changes sides . 
The inspectors have very little information , and Iraq has the upper hand . 
All the research and production facilities are under Iraqi , not UN , control . 
British and American intelligence can only provide circumstantial evidence of what Iraq is doing in the weapons area . 
For inspections to work , the UN will have to get inside information . 
Accounting for this information gap , UN Security Council Resolution 1441 empowers the inspectors to talk to Iraqi scientists without government minders , outside of Iraq if necessary , and accompanied by their families . 
Most Iraqi scientists I knew would consider this a blessed opportunity to escape the confinement and threats that shadow their lives . 
Saddam is aware of their value to the UN and recently ordered the resettlement of their families to high-security camps . 
Incredibly , the UN inspection team leaders indicate that they do not plan to bring the scientists out of Iraq . 
They will rely for now on physical inspection , not private interviews with the people most directly responsible for building Iraq &apos;s weapons . 
The new inspections regimen has already been compromised by its passive approach . 
To join the inspectors , weapons experts are obliged to resign from their national postings , but few are ready to give up their careers to work in the UN bureaucracy . 
Thus , the UN team is much smaller and less experienced than its predecessors , and faces Iraqi counterparts steeped in the art of deception . 
I fear that the inspections effort is not intended to uncover the full extent of Iraq &apos;s illegal weapons program . 
The Europeans are treating Iraq as a prize to be denied the US , not as a strategic danger . 
What drives the inspections is fear of an American invasion . 
The Americans will be accommodated up to the point that their attack is forestalled . 
On December 8 , Iraq is obliged to declare formally its full weapons program . 
We can expect the inspectors to be flooded with information about everything but the actual weapons . 
It is will be vintage Saddam : diversion with no real revelations . 
The real test will be for the Americans . 
Either they get the information they need , or the game will be over . 
Saddam will be the winner , ready to play another day .
