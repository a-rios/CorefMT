How Fast Will China Grow ? 
BEIJING - In the 35 years since China &apos;s transition to a market economy began , the country has grown at an average rate of 9.8 % - an explosive and unprecedented rise . 
But there are signs that the Chinese miracle is coming to an end - or at least that the country &apos;s economic growth is slowing . 
China &apos;s growth rate has been falling since the first quarter of 2010 . 
In 2014 , it was a relatively anemic 7.4 % . 
China &apos;s economic growth is likely to continue to face stiff headwinds this year as well , at least when compared to previous decades . 
As policymakers draw up the country &apos;s 13th five-year plan , they will grapple with a fundamental question : How fast can China expect to grow ? 
In setting a country &apos;s GDP target , the first thing to understand is the economy &apos;s potential growth rate : the maximum pace of expansion that can be attained , assuming favorable conditions , internally and externally , without endangering the stability and sustainability of future growth . 
As Adam Smith discussed in An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations , economic growth depends on improvements in labor productivity , which today result from either technological innovation or industrial upgrading ( the reallocation of productive capacity into new sectors with higher added value ) . 
But developed countries at the innovation frontier are at a disadvantage . 
To benefit from new technology , they must create it . 
Developing countries , by contrast , possess a &quot; latecomer advantage , &quot; because they can achieve technological advances through imitation , importation , integration , and licensing . 
As a result , their costs and risks are lower . 
Over the last 150 years , developed economies have grown at an average rate of 3 % per year , whereas some developing countries have achieved annual growth rates of 7 % or higher for periods of 20 years or longer . 
To calculate how much of a latecomer advantage China has after 35 years of unprecedented growth , one needs to look at the gap between its levels of technological and industrial development and those of high-income countries . 
The best way to see this is by comparing its per capita income , adjusted for purchasing power parity ( PPP ) , with those of developed countries . 
The larger the gap in per capita income , the larger the latecomer advantage and the greater the potential for growth . 
In 2008 , China &apos;s per capita income was just over one-fifth that of the United States . 
This gap is roughly equal to the gap between the US and Japan in 1951 , after which Japan grew at an average annual rate of 9.2 % for the next 20 years , or between the US and South Korea in 1977 , after which South Korea grew at 7.6 % per year for two decades . 
Singapore in 1967 and Taiwan in 1975 had similar gaps - followed by similar growth rates . 
By extension , in the 20 years after 2008 , China should have a potential growth rate of roughly 8 % . 
But potential growth is just one part of the story . 
Whether it can be achieved depends on domestic conditions and the international environment . 
In order to exploit its latecomer advantage , China must deepen its reforms and eliminate its economy &apos;s residual distortions . 
Meanwhile , the government should play a proactive role in overcoming the market failures - such as externalities and coordination problems - that are certain to accompany technological innovation and industrial upgrading . 
China has the potential to maintain robust growth by relying on domestic demand - and not only household consumption . 
The country suffers no lack of investment opportunities , with significant scope for industrial upgrading and plenty of potential for improvement in urban infrastructure , public housing , and environmental management . 
Moreover , China &apos;s investment resources are abundant . 
Combined central- and local-government debt amounts to less than 50 % of GDP - low by international standards . 
Meanwhile , private savings in China amount to nearly 50 % of GDP , and the country &apos;s foreign-exchange reserves have reached $ 4 trillion . 
Even under comparatively unfavorable external conditions , China can rely on investment to create jobs in the short term ; as the number of jobs grows , so will consumption . 
The external scenario , however , is gloomier . 
Though developed countries &quot; authorities intervened strongly in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008 , launching significant fiscal- and monetary-stimulus measures , many of their structural shortcomings remain unresolved . 
&quot; Abenomics &quot; in Japan has yet to yield results , and the European Central Bank is following in the footsteps of America and Japan , pursuing quantitative easing in an effort to shore up demand . 
Employment in the US is growing , but the rate of workforce participation remains subdued and the economy has yet to attain the 6-7 % growth rates usually recorded in a post-recession rebound . 
The US , Europe , and Japan are likely to experience continued sluggish performance , inhibiting China &apos;s export growth . 
As a result , Chinese growth is likely to fall below its potential of 8 % a year . 
As policymakers plan for the next five years , they should set China &apos;s growth targets at 7-7.5 % , adjusting them within that range as changes in the international climate dictate . 
Such a growth target can help to stabilize employment , lower financial risk , and achieve the country &apos;s goal of doubling income by 2020 .
