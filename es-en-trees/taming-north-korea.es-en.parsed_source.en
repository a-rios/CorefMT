Taming North Korea 
The fires of the Middle East must not be allowed to distract the world &apos;s attention from the threat posed by North Korea &apos;s nuclear ambitions , which it demonstrated by its recent test of a long-range missile . 
Yet that is what appears to be happening . 
In mid-July , the Group of Eight &apos;s summit in St. Petersburg ended by calling on North Korea to stop its missile tests and to abandon its nuclear weapons program . 
This followed a UN Security Council resolution that condemned North Korea &apos;s missile launches of July 5 , demanded that it return to the negotiating table , and required UN members to prevent the import and export of any material or money related to North Korea &apos;s missile or unconventional weapons programs . 
China &apos;s President Hu Jintao urged progress in the stalled talks so that &quot; the entire Korean peninsula can be denuclearized . &quot; 
This seemed like a diplomatic breakthrough , but there was less forward movement than meets the eye . 
During its first term , the Bush administration hoped that it could solve the North Korean nuclear problem through regime change . 
The hope was that isolation and sanctions would topple Kim Jong Il &apos;s dictatorship . 
But the regime proved resistant , and the Bush administration agreed to enter into six-party talks with China , Russia , Japan , and the two Koreas . 
In September 2005 , it appeared momentarily that the talks had produced a rough agreement that North Korea would forgo its nuclear program in return for security guarantees and removal of sanctions . 
But the loosely worded accord soon collapsed , and North Korea refused to return to the talks until the US stopped shutting down bank accounts suspected of counterfeiting and laundering money for Kim &apos;s regime . 
Diplomacy remained stalled until North Korea launched a series of missiles into the Sea of Japan in July . 
Japan called for UN Security Council sanctions , and after ten days of wrangling , all five permanent members agreed on a resolution condemning North Korea &apos;s actions . 
Why did North Korea risk taking actions that defied China , its main benefactor , and brought about the UN resolution ? 
In part , it acted because it saw the great powers offering Iran an interesting package of incentives to give up its nuclear enrichment program , while North Korea was being relegated to a diplomatic side track . 
But it also acted because taking such risks has proven successful in the past , and here , Kim probably believed the risks were low . 
Kim knows that the five other countries in the six-party talks are divided . 
While all five want a non-nuclear North Korea , China and South Korea place a higher priority on the stability of the North Korean regime than the US and Japan do . 
South Korean public opinion is split on how to handle the North , but the majority fear that a sudden collapse would have catastrophic effects on the South &apos;s economy . 
Many in the younger generation have no direct memories of the Korean War . 
Thus , South Korea &apos;s &quot; sunshine policy &quot; of economic engagement with the North commands majority approval . 
Similarly , China , with its focus on economic growth , fears that a collapse of the North Korean regime would threaten stability on its borders . 
Thus , while China has occasionally pressed North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program , it has been unwilling to exercise its economic leverage to a point that threatens the regime . 
Because its preferred approach of regime change has proven slower than expected , and because time plays into Kim &apos;s hands , the Bush administration faces three other options in attempting to deal with North Korea &apos;s nuclear weapons . 
It could use force , and some officials have argued that if North Korea launched a war in response to a limited American air strike , Kim would lose his regime . 
Thus , war would be unlikely . 
But is unlikely that an air strike would destroy North Korea &apos;s hidden facilities , which include more than 10,000 artillery tubes buried in caves along the demilitarized zone , North Korea could simply shell Seoul in response and wreak havoc on the South Korean economy . 
Thus , South Korea , together with China , would likely react strongly against an American air strike . 
A second option is sanctions . 
Some in the Bush administration believe that even if economic sanctions would not end the regime , they might cause enough pain to cause Kim to give up its weapons . 
They point to the success of efforts to shut down illegal banking transactions and to the Proliferation Security Initiative , in which other countries agree to interdict transport of nuclear materials . 
But success depends upon China , and South Korea and China failed to participate in recent PSI exercises . 
Moreover , in the wrangling over the UN resolution , China threatened a veto if there were any references to Chapter VII of the Charter , which allows enforcement . 
Knowing that China will not allow sanctions to cut too deeply , Kim is unlikely to give up his nuclear ace . 
That leaves the third option , a diplomatic bargain , for which Kim &apos;s price is direct talks with the US , a security guarantee , and the type of economic incentives that were offered to Iran . 
Bush has allowed his representative to the six-party talks to meet separately with the North Koreans within the six-party framework , but he failed to provide adequate incentives . 
Given North Korea &apos;s past deceptions , and the difficulty of verifying denuclearization in a totalitarian country , a verifiable agreement will be difficult to reach . 
But given the other options , the US would be wise to start thinking of a new diplomatic package .
