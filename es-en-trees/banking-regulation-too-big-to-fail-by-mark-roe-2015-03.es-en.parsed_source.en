Winning the Too-Big-to-Fail Battle 
CAMBRIDGE - Headlines about banks &quot; risks to the financial system continue to dominate the financial news . 
Bank of America performed poorly on the US Federal Reserve &apos;s financial stress tests , and regulators criticized Goldman Sachs &quot; and JPMorgan Chase &apos;s financing plans , leading both to lower their planned dividends and share buybacks . 
And Citibank &apos;s hefty buildup of its financial trading business raises doubts about whether it is controlling risk properly . 
These results suggest that some of the biggest banks remain at risk . 
And yet bankers are insisting that the post-crisis task of strengthening regulation and building a safer financial system has nearly been completed , with some citing recent studies of bank safety to support this argument . 
So which is it : Are banks still at risk ? 
Or has post-crisis regulatory reform done its job ? 
The 2008 financial crisis highlighted two dangerous features of today &apos;s financial system . 
First , governments will bail out the largest banks rather than let them collapse and damage the economy . 
Second , and worse , being too big to fail helps large banks grow even larger , as creditors and trading partners prefer to work with banks that have an implicit government guarantee . 
Too-big-to-fail banks enjoy lower interest rates on debt than their mid-size counterparts , because lenders know that the bonds or trading contracts that such banks issue will be paid , even if the bank itself fails . 
Before , during , and just after the 2007-2008 financial crisis , this provided an advantage equivalent to more than one-third of the largest US banks &quot; equity value . 
Bailouts of too-big-to-fail banks are unpopular among economists , policymakers , and taxpayers , who resent special deals for financial bigwigs . 
Public anger gave regulators in the United States and elsewhere widespread support after the financial crisis to set higher capital and other safety requirements . 
And more regulatory changes are in the works . 
New studies , including important ones from the International Monetary Fund and the US Government Accountability Office , do indeed show that the long-term boost afforded to too-big-to-fail banks like Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , and Bank of America is declining from its pre-crisis high . 
This is good news . 
The bad news is that US bank representatives cite these studies when claiming , in the financial media and presumably to their favorite members of Congress , that the too-big-to-fail phenomenon has been contained and that the time has come for regulators to back off . 
This is a dangerous idea , for several reasons . 
For starters , the IMF &apos;s research and similar studies show that the likelihood of a bailout over the life of the bonds already issued by banks is indeed now lower . 
But the studies do not specify why . 
Lower bailout risk could reflect the perception that the regulation already in place is appropriate and complete . 
Or bond-market participants may expect that new regulations , like the stress tests , will finish the job . 
The studies could be telling us that investors believe that regulators are on the case and have enough political support to implement further safeguards . 
Or they could think that the economy is currently strong enough that the banks will not fail before the bonds are paid off in a few years . 
The second reason why such studies should not deter regulators from continued intelligent action is that the research focuses on long-term debt . 
But that is not the right place to look nowadays , because regulators are positioning long-term debt to take the hit in a meltdown , while making banks &quot; extremely profitable - and far more volatile - short-term debt and trading operations more certain to be paid in full . 
As a result , traders choose too-big-to-fail banks , rather than mid-size institutions , as counter-parties for their short-term trades , causing the large banks &quot; trading books - and , hence , their profits - to surge . 
Measuring the boost to short-term debt is not easy . 
But it is most likely quite large . 
The major banks &quot; recent effort , led by Citigroup , to convince the US Congress to repeal a key provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that would have pushed much of their short-term trading to distant affiliates ( which are not too big to fail ) reinforces this interpretation . 
The banks know that they will receive more business if they run their trading desks from the part of their corporate group that has the strongest government backing . 
The third reason to be wary of bankers &quot; confidence that the regulatory job is complete is that once they believe it , they will behave accordingly - less frightened of failure and thus willing to take on more risk . 
That seems to have been the case before the financial crisis , and there is no business or psychological reason to think that it will not happen again . 
Regulators must not be deterred by bank lobbying or studies that measure neither the short-term boost afforded by a bank &apos;s too-big-to-fail status nor how much of the perception of increased safety can be attributed to the regulations in place and the expectation of additional good regulation . 
In the absence of such studies , regulators must use their own judgment and intelligence . 
If &quot; too big to fail &quot; also means &quot; too big to regulate , &quot; the perception of increased safety will not last long .
