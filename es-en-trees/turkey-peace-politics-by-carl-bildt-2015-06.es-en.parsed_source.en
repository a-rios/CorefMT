Turkey &apos;s Politics of Peace 
VIENNA - Turkey is moving into unchartered political territory , following the failure of the ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) to retain its parliamentary majority in the country &apos;s recent general election . 
The choices that Turkey makes in establishing a new government will not only be pivotal to shaping the future of democracy there ; the next administration could also play a decisive role in a series of peace processes vital to restoring stability in the wider Middle East . 
First and foremost for Turkey , there is the ongoing peace process with its own Kurdish population . 
At its core , this process is about redefining the secular , unitary state created in 1923 . 
Everyone in the new republic who was not explicitly defined as a member of an officially recognized minority was supposed to merge into a new Turkish identity . 
But this did not happen as Atatürk planned . 
Kurds held fast to their own ethnic identity . 
Eventually , the suppression of the Kurdish language and culture fueled a brutal insurgency , led by the Kurdish Workers &quot; Party ( PKK ) which has cost the country more than 30,000 lives . 
It is to the great credit of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan that he had the courage to launch an open peace process with the PKK in 2013 . 
Since then , that process has made progress that seemed unthinkable only a few years ago . 
Yet key steps toward lasting peace remain to be taken . 
A comprehensive settlement of the Kurdish issue within Turkey will be key to the country &apos;s stability and the future of its bid for accession to the European Union . 
Otherwise , one can envisage scenarios in which the forces of disintegration now roiling the neighboring Levant actually spread into Turkey itself , with unimaginable consequences . 
The success of the mainly Kurdish Peoples &quot; Democratic Party ( HDP ) in capturing 13 % of the vote in the recent election - a total well above the party &apos;s core constituency - should boost the Kurds &quot; confidence and ease the way ahead in the peace process . 
But the far-right Nationalist Movement Party ( MHP ) performed strongly in the election , capturing 16 % of the vote , probably owing largely to popular opposition to the opening to the Kurds . 
Indeed , even Erdoğan , evidently trying to stop the MHP &apos;s advance , used campaign rhetoric that alienated many Kurdish voters . 
A high priority for any new government in Turkey should be to complete the peace process that Erdoğan began . 
And Erdoğan should understand that his legacy might well be shaped by whether that process succeeds or fails . 
The second peace process at stake is the new attempt to unify Cyprus , which has been divided since its constitutional breakdown in 1963 and Turkey &apos;s invasion in 1974 . 
Indeed , it is bizarre that the capital of an EU member country is divided by a dead zone patrolled for decades by United Nations peacekeeping troops . 
The continued division of Cyprus is blocking both the EU accession talks with Turkey and increasingly necessary cooperation between the EU and NATO . 
But now , under President Nicos Anastasiades and the newly elected president of Northern Cyprus , Mustafa Akinci , there is a real possibility , after years of stalemate , of reaching a settlement that can re-unify the island . 
UN-supported talks have acquired new and important momentum . 
But a settlement will not be possible without the clear support of the Turkish government . 
The new administration &apos;s stance will thus be critical : Turkey has much to gain by supporting a solution in Cyprus ; but it could also revert to old habits and spoil today &apos;s unique opportunity . 
The third peace process in play concerns Turkey &apos;s relationship with Armenia , which , if improved , could help create the conditions for a peace settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan . 
A far-sighted agreement was signed by Armenia and Turkey in Zürich in October 2009 ; but wider regional forces eventually blocked progress , with Russian intervention decisive . 
Maintaining the frozen conflict with Armenia is not in the long-term interests of Turkey or any other state in the region . 
The ongoing blockades and military face-offs could , at some point , lead to violent upheaval in the southern Caucasus , with very negative effects for Turkey . 
The next government should resume the approach it took in Zürich - and Armenia &apos;s government must do the same . 
The fourth and most immediately consequential peace process concerns Syria . 
Turkey has taken a principled and strong stand against President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime , and has generously taken in more than a million refugees . 
But the dangers posed by the ongoing conflict , particularly the strains on Turkey itself , should not be underestimated . 
All key actors have a common interest in preserving the Syrian state while changing the regime . 
A complete collapse , fueled by efforts to impose a political solution by military means , would most likely lead to catastrophic consequences for decades to come , with Turkey among the worst affected . 
So Turkey &apos;s new administration should be ready to engage in a constructive dialogue , together with the United States and Iran , on possible solutions . 
The immediate task facing Turkey is to bridge old divisions and establish a functioning coalition government . 
Otherwise , a fresh election - and thus fresh political uncertainty - will be unavoidable . 
That is why Turkey &apos;s friends should take this opportunity to remind the country &apos;s leaders of what is at stake - for Turkey itself , as well as for peace in the region .
