The Boundaries of Anti-Semitism 
Anti-Semitism nowadays is more subtle than spray-painting swastikas and other acts of vandalism . 
Hundreds of European scholars are circulating a petition calling for a boycott of Israeli institutions ; other academics want the EU to deny grants to Israeli universities and scientific institutions . 
One British academic fired an Israeli colleague because she loathes the state of Israel . 
So , what is new about today &apos;s anti-Semitism , asks George Fletcher ? 
Civilized people are loath to admit that they are racist , sexist , or anti-Semitic . 
But they disagree about when these taboos are violated . 
If they think that blacks make better athletes or that women make better caretakers , they deny that this is bias . 
But what about those who believe that &quot; rich Jews &quot; control , say , the media ? 
Are they merely mistaken , or is that &quot; mistake &quot; a moral vice ? 
Today , drawing the boundaries of anti-Semitism is difficult , because much of the world disapproves of Israel &apos;s military crackdown in the occupied West Bank and Gaza strip . 
Whether criticism of Israeli policies is right or wrong , pundits and politicians who speak out on the issue should not be lumped together with those who say that Hitler should have finished the job . 
Yet many Americans think that much of Europe &apos;s critique of Israeli policies expresses a zeal that cannot be explained simply by Europeans &apos; renunciation of their own colonial past and thus their sensitivity to an Israeli occupation that looks like annexation . 
As one commentator put it , Europeans feel a collective guilt about the Holocaust that makes them eager to have Israel stamped as an aggressor contemptuous of Palestinian humanity . 
The Germans , as one quip puts it , will never forgive the Jews for Auschwitz . 
But guilt and anger have deeper roots in Europe &apos;s image of the Jew . 
More than most people realize , the Gospels treat recalcitrant Jews - those who refused to accept Jesus as their Messiah - as perpetrators of a crime that lives on in every generation . 
Anti-Semites often cite a passage in Matthew in which a Jewish crowd cheers for Christ &apos;s execution and voluntarily accepts permanent guilt : &quot; His blood be on us and on our children . &quot; 
Matthew then attributes to the Jews a recurrent lie explaining away the resurrection and disappearance of Jesus &apos;s body : &quot; His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we slept . &quot; 
The later Evangelist John concludes that because Jews deny the Christian Messiah they must be &quot; sons of the devil . &quot; 
Just as whites attribute extraordinary sexual powers to black men , the Christian West &apos;s instinct is to treat Jews as the masters of extraordinary forces - including the power to kill deities and control world finance . 
A cartoon earlier this year in the Italian newspaper La Stampa captured this latent sentiment perfectly . 
A group of Israeli soldiers surround a manger with a baby . 
The caption reads : Will they kill him again ? 
To be sure , at the time of Jesus , Jews constituted a hegemonic majority in Jerusalem . 
Jews who rejected Jesus were , indeed , among the first to be intolerant toward the early Christians . 
But other hostilities soon took hold , and by the fourth century , Christians had more to fear from each other than from outsiders . 
Yet the fear of Jewish prowess continued to shape the thinking of the West , both consciously and unconsciously . 
In the fall of 2001 the Parisian Comedie Francaise staged a brilliant production of Shakespeare &apos;s Merchant of Venice . 
As though it were second nature in French culture , the director presented Shylock &apos;s attempt to collect his pound of flesh by recalling the image of the crucifixion . 
Antonio is stretched out on a rock with arms perpendicular , the Jew Shylock leaning over his breast with his knife drawn . 
This is apparently the natural way for Christians to think of Jews - reenacting in every generation the crime described by Matthew . 
It is as though a form of original sin entered a subspecies of humanity descended from Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . 
The belief in both the diabolical power and the permanent guilt of the Jews is , to my mind , the essence of anti-Semitism . 
It is when this image is invoked in politics that critics cross the line between the constructive and the vicious . 
A good example of this politicized imagery is a poster distributed by Amnesty International in Switzerland . 
It displayed a composite picture of an Israeli tank and a soldier taking aim at a defenseless Palestinian . 
The caption read : Let the killing stop . 
Only Palestinian victims are listed . 
Under protest , the poster was withdrawn . 
The Catholic Church has abandoned its anti-Jewish teachings , but this does not that mean that the culture engendered by Christianity can easily redefine its premises . 
In fact , the Christian image of the all-powerful Jew feeds the conspiracy theories that infect the way Muslims regard Jews . 
In the Arab media , Jewish conspiracies constitute the single most popular explanation for everything from the September 11 th terrorist attacks to the Monica Lewinsky affair during the Clinton presidency ( Miss Lewinsky being the Jewish spy who infiltrates the White House ) . 
Israelis blame their critics for not shedding these irrational beliefs . 
They find it hard to negotiate peace in a world that approaches them armed with the hateful echoes of medieval superstition . 
In contrast to the Muslim world , Europeans pride themselves on being objective . 
But it is time that they come to grips with their inner conflicts about Jewish guilt - and their own .
