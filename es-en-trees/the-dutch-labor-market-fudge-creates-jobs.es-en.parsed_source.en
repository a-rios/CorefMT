The Dutch Labor Market Fudge Creates Jobs 
AMSTERDAM : The Dutch like to think of themselves as leaders in social policy . 
But as we discovered on a recent trip to the Netherlands and Germany , it is in economic policy that today &apos;s Europe looks to Holland for leadership . 
With unemployment in Germany , France and Italy around 10 % , the Dutch jobless rate , at less than 3 % , is the envy of Europe . 
Holland is that rare example of a booming welfare state ( &quot; overheating &quot; was the word used to describe the Dutch economy by three central bankers in Frankfurt ) . 
How did this happen ? 
Some credit the so-called &quot; Polder Model &quot; of social cooperation between employers , unions and the government . 
They &apos;re wrong . 
Social cooperation per se did not save the Dutch from the mistakes of the 60 &quot; s and 70 &quot; s . 
So how can it be credited for economic recovery in the mid 80 &quot; s and 90 &quot; s ? 
True , Dutch trade unions have moderated wage demands . 
Instead , credit structural reforms in the Dutch labor market for the jobs boom . 
Primary amongst these is the widespread use of part-time and temporary employees . 
The move to part-time employment in Holland was intended to increase female participation in the Dutch labor force . 
Increasing availability of part-time and temporary jobs , however , raised the labor force participation rates of both men and women . 
Regular full-time employees are almost impossible to sack under Dutch law , but employers can fire part-time workers and not renew temporary contracts when they expire . 
There is an &quot; iron law &quot; of employment : If employers can &apos;t fire workers , they won &apos;t hire them . 
Ironically , employment boomed in Holland , precisely because an increasing proportion of the work force - made up of part-time and temporary workers - can be fired if necessary . 
Among the Euro-11 countries , Holland was the first to both understand this point and act upon it . 
Yet Holland has not gone all the way . 
An extraordinarily high proportion of the labor force - 12 % - is officially classified as &quot; sick &quot; or &quot; invalid &quot; because putting a worker on disability is practically the only way Dutch employers have of ridding their firms of unwanted full-time employees . 
Such finagling is costly to business , government and the employees themselves . 
So , while still extremely low for continental Europe , the official Dutch unemployment rate underestimates the true level of joblessness in the Dutch economy , because it excludes the disguised unemployment of the &quot; sick &quot; and &quot; disabled . &quot; 
Were Dutch law to permit the sacking of full time employees ( not likely in these prosperous times ) the proportion of the work force officially sanctioned as too sick or disabled to work would dramatically decline , as would the number of part-time and temporary workers . 
The ability to fire workers not only means less unemployment but more flexible labor markets . 
The movement of workers from low to higher productivity uses - whether from firm-to-firm , sector-to-sector or region-to-region - is thwarted if employers do not have the power to sack . 
This is not an issue of class struggle , but of economic growth . 
US Fed Chairman Greenspan asked recently , &quot; why U.S. businesses and workers appear to have benefitted more from the recent advances in information technology than their counterparts in Europe and Japan ? &quot; 
His answer : &quot; the relatively inflexible and , hence , more costly labor markets of these economies appears to be a significant part of the explanation ... Europe has participated in the wave of invention and innovation , but appears to have been slower to exploit it . &quot; 
What Greenspan suggests is that the labor market flexibility gap between the US and Europe may be more important in explaining relative economic performance than the alleged technology gap . 
There appears to be a right way , a wrong way , and a Dutch way of doing things . 
The US does labor market policy the right way . 
Continental Europe , excluding Holland , does it the wrong way . 
And the Dutch , neither right nor wrong , temper ideology with practicality to forge compromises that have consensus support . 
Although this system works for the Dutch , can it work for the rest of Europe ? 
Why not ? 
Politically , no European country can - or really wants to - adopt the American model . 
At the same time , there is a growing demand in Europe for better economic performance . 
European unemployment rates are unacceptably high ; 
America &apos;s long boom puts pressure on domestic politicians to do better . 
The Dutch solution best fits Europe &apos;s present political realities : Keep welfare rules in place , but give people the chance to get around them . 
The Dutch retain the job-killing laws that make it impossible to sack regular full-time employees , but allow employers to sack part-time and temporary workers . 
This fudge , not social cooperation , is the true &quot; Dutch model &quot; for success . 
The Dutch solution can work for other European countries . 
In fact , it already has . 
When the French changed their labor law to mandate the 35 hour work week , heavy restrictions on the use of part-time and temporary employees by French employers were removed . 
This explains the recent upsurge in French job creation . 
Superficially , France looks as if it has become more of a welfare state , but the reality is that the French have mimicked the Dutch in increasing labor market flexibility . 
This Dutch solution may be second best , but in Europe it &apos;s the only alternative that works .
