A Communist Party without Communism 
PRINCETON - Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s anointment of Alexander Medvedev to succeed him in what is supposed to be a democratic presidential election next March shows that Russia &apos;s leaders have not changed a whit . 
It looks increasingly likely that , as under Leonid Brezhnev , we will see the same names in the news for decades to come . 
According to Gleb Pavlovsky , the Putin regime &apos;s leading ideologist , the current Russian system is perfect in all respects but one : it doesn &apos;t know its enemies . 
Indeed , it seems as if everyone in the Kremlin is reading Carl Schmitt , the Nazi legal theorist who taught that naming your enemy is the central mission of politics . 
In the spirit of Schmitt , Putin &apos;s men designated a liberal party , the Union of Right Forces , as their ur-enemy . 
Its public meetings were broken up by armed police ; its leaders arrested and beaten ; 
Putin called its supporters &quot; coyotes . &quot; 
What is surprising is that this aggressive behavior occurred in response to no visible danger . 
Oil prices are soaring , as are Putin &apos;s approval ratings . 
His appointees control everything that matters , from Gazprom to the Central Electoral Committee . 
Since the pacification of Chechnya with violence and subsidies , the incarceration or emigration of a few financially viable opponents , and the massive &quot; social investments &quot; of recent years , which , under Medvedev &apos;s personal supervision , have bribed the population , no credible force can seriously challenge Putin &apos;s men . 
Yet their regime is in crisis , and they know it . 
Russia &apos;s economy is more dependent on gas and oil than ever before . 
Military reform has been reversed . 
Despite increasing incomes , Russians are less educated and less healthy than they were when Putin came to power ; they still die at a shockingly young age . 
Russian involvement in world affairs is tainted by poison and corruption . 
State monopolies undo what private businesses created . 
With more money , ill-educated bureaucrats hire more ill-educated bureaucrats ; as a result , the regime fails to rule the country . 
The country is unruly , and its rulers know it . 
So they panic . 
Putin &apos;s aim was to subject all power to the control of Russia &apos;s security forces . 
His generation of KGB officers watched the collapse of the Communist Party and all the governmental bodies that it &quot; directed and controlled , &quot; including the KGB . 
Under Putin , the security service has had its revenge . 
Its people have become powerful , arrogant , and enormously rich . 
They have also become disobedient . 
In 2004 , General Viktor Cherkesov , then Putin &apos;s representative in northwest Russia , published an essay that glorified the KGB as the only unspoiled authority in a corrupted country . 
This essay , more than anything else , defined Putin &apos;s second term . 
In October 2007 , Cherkesov ( now chief of one of the most obscure and powerful services , the Federal Anti-Drug Administration ) published another essay in which he lamented his colleagues &quot; degradation : warriors had turned into traders , he complained . 
Earlier , generals from a competing service , the FSB , had arrested Cherkesov &apos;s deputy for &quot; illegal bugging . &quot; 
In a public gesture of despair , Cherkesov admitted the failure of Putin &apos;s project to reanimate Russian governance by subordinating it to the security services . 
Cherkesov &apos;s deputy remains in prison . 
Most believe that Putin is unable to intervene in his defense . 
In the absence of Communist Party control , these security officers betrayed their corporate ethic and engaged in horse-trading , applying force when a trade did not go well . 
That this happens to ordinary Russians is clear ; what Cherkesov revealed was that Putin &apos;s circle also confronts this situation . 
What is to be done when ex-KGB warriors turn their swords and bugs against one another ? 
Cherkesov &apos;s case exemplifies Putin &apos;s nightmare . 
But if your instincts betray you , you go back to even deeper ones . 
Now that Putin &apos;s people have left their predecessors &quot; neo-liberal ideas behind and feel disenchanted with the ex-KGB clique , the task is to recreate an omnipresent political party that controls the security services , the administration , business , and much else . 
This party will be centralized under personal leadership and will reduce the state to a legal fiction . 
Preaching nationalism , its managers will believe in their universal competence , as opposed to KGB-style professionalism and corporatism . 
Boris Yeltsin forbade party cells in state-controlled institutions by decree . 
Putin &apos;s lawyers will reverse that decision ; the party will have cells or committees in every factory , corporation , military unit , university department , etc . 
Integrated by the leader &apos;s charisma and party discipline , party members will direct and unify the desolated country . 
This is Putin &apos;s plan . 
Like former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov , the only other KGB man to rule Russia , Putin will become the party &apos;s general secretary . 
As in the Soviet era , state and governmental officials will be reduced to party ciphers - the role that President Medvedev will play under General Secretary Putin . 
And , of course , being General Secretary carries no constitutional term limit . 
In the end , Putin has what history left him : not ideas , just a faction yearning to consolidate its grip on power . 
Lenin and Trotsky needed a party to make their ideology a reality ; 
Putin and Medvedev are devising an ideology to solidify their party . 
It is a bizarre ideology . 
Accusing warriors of being traders and traders of being thieves , it shuns its Marxist origins . 
It will subordinate all who really do work - traders , warriors , journalists , and others - to party ideologues whose sole job is to search for enemies .
