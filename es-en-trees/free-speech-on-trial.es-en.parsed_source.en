Free Speech on Trial 
Not so long ago , there was jubilation that the free world and its values had prevailed in the Cold War . 
When the Communist empire collapsed , some even announced that the victory of liberty and democracy implied the &quot; end of history . &quot; 
But history never bowed out ; at most , it only took a decade-long intermission , with its next act heralded by the terrorist attacks in the United States in September 2001 . 
And here the plot has thickened . 
Instead of rejoicing in the liberal order , those of us who have the pleasure of living under it have had to struggle to keep it intact and strong . 
Since 9 / 11 , more and more freedoms are being restricted in the name of defending liberty . 
New visa requirements and other obstacles to travel , more intimate data collected by governments , and the presence of video cameras everywhere - at once benign and intrusive - remind one more of George Orwell &apos;s Big Brother than of John Stuart Mill &apos;s On Liberty . 
Britain is not the only country where ancient rights of habeas corpus , of the inviolability of the person , are to be restricted by new legislation that , for example , extends the permissible length of detention without charge . 
Now , even the fundamental right of a liberal order , free speech , is under pressure . 
Some restrictions are understandable legacies of the past , but must nevertheless be re-examined . 
In Austria , the historian David Irving was arrested recently because he has denied that the Holocaust happened . 
In the prison library , however , Irving found two of the books he had written that had led to his arrest ! 
In Berlin , there is much concern about the possible desecration of the Holocaust Memorial , although its author , the American architect Peter Eisenmann , takes a relaxed view of what is said and done about his creation . 
Other restrictions of free speech have more recent triggers . 
In the Netherlands , the shock that arose over the killing of the film maker Theo van Gogh runs deep and has led to demands for legislation against hate speech . 
In Britain , proposed legislation concerning incitement to religious hatred and terrorism has led to emotional parliamentary debates - and to doubts about the liberal credentials of Tony Blair &apos;s government . 
Can such demands for restricting free speech ever be legitimate ? 
The first and principled answer must surely be no . 
All freedoms can be abused by liberty &apos;s enemies , but in the case of speech , the risk posed by restricting freedom is surely greater . 
Moreover , the benefits of tolerating free speech outweigh the harm of abusing it . 
Indeed , the Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen has demonstrated that free speech even helps mitigate seemingly natural catastrophes like famines , because it reveals the ways in which a few haves exploit the many have-nots . 
As the watchdog organization Transparency International reminds us , corruption exposed is in many cases corruption prevented . 
These practical consequences are above and beyond the liberating effect of allowing the &quot; marketplace of ideas , &quot; rather than state authorities , to judge people &apos;s expressed views . 
Are there really no exceptions to this rule ? 
The classic example comes to mind of the man who shouts &quot; Fire ! &quot; in a crowded theatre . 
In the resulting panic , people may be hurt or even killed . 
Nowadays , we worry about incitement ­ - using free speech to provoke violence . 
I do not know how many Islamic leaders preach murder and mayhem in mosques and help recruit suicide bombers from among their congregants ; but even if it is only a handful , they pose a question that must be answered . 
That answer must be given carefully . 
For free societies to flourish , the boundaries of free speech should always be widened rather than narrowed . 
In my view , Holocaust denial should not be outlawed , in contrast to the demand for all , or any , Jews to be killed . 
Similarly , attacks against the West in mosques , however vicious , should not be banned , in contrast to open encouragement to join suicide death squads . 
What about the mere praise of &quot; martyrs &quot; who have died while murdering others ? 
The boundary between implicit and explicit incitement is not easily drawn , but , again , it should be wider rather than narrower . 
Free speech is immensely precious , and so is the dignity and integrity of humans . 
Both require active and alert citizens who engage what they do not like rather than calling for the state to clamp down on it . 
Direct incitement to violence is regarded - as it should be ­ - as an unacceptable abuse of free speech ; but much that is disagreeable about the David Irving &apos;s and the hate preachers does not fall into this category . 
Their rants should be rejected with argument , not with police and prisons .
