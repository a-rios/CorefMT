The Trouble with Japanese Nationalism 
Barely half a year into his premiership , Japan &apos;s Shinzo Abe is provoking anger across Asia and mixed feelings in his country &apos;s key ally , the United States . 
But will the Bush administration use its influence to nudge Abe away from inflammatory behavior ? 
Abe &apos;s predecessor , Junichiro Koizumi , was a mold-breaking leader , reviving Japan &apos;s economy , reforming the postal savings system , and smashing the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party &apos;s faction system . 
But Koizumi also legitimized a new Japanese nationalism , antagonizing China and South Korea by his annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine . 
If anything , Abe is even more committed to building an assertive and unapologetic Japan . 
Anyone who believes that the Yasukuni controversy is an obscure historical matter that Chinese and Koreans use to badger Japan for political advantage has probably never spent much time there . 
The problem is not the 12 Class-A war criminals interred at the shrine ; the real problem is the Yushukan military museum next door . 
Walking past the Mitsubishi Zero , tanks , and machine guns on display in the museum , one finds a history of the Pacific War that restores &quot; the Truth of Modern Japanese History . &quot; 
Japan &apos;s colonial occupation of Korea , for example , is described as a &quot; partnership &quot; ; one looks in vain for any account of the victims of Japanese militarism in Nanjing or Manila . 
One might be able to defend the museum as one viewpoint among many in a pluralist democracy . 
But there is no other museum in Japan that gives an alternative view of Japan &apos;s twentieth-century history . 
Successive Japanese governments have hidden behind the Yushukan museum &apos;s operation by a private religious organization to deny responsibility for the views expressed there . 
That is an unconvincing stance . 
In fact , unlike Germany , Japan has never come to terms with its own responsibility for the Pacific War . 
Although socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama officially apologized to China in 1995 for the war , Japan has never had a genuine internal debate over its degree of responsibility , and has never made a determined effort to propagate an alternative account to that of Yushukan . 
My exposure to the Japanese right came in the early 1990 &quot; s , when I was on a couple of panels in Japan with Watanabe Soichi , who was selected by my Japanese publisher ( unbeknownst to me ) to translate my book The End of History and the Last Man into Japanese . 
Watanabe , a professor at Sophia University , was a collaborator of Shintaro Ishihara , the nationalist politician who wrote The Japan That Can Say No and is now the governor of Tokyo . 
In the course of a couple of encounters , I heard him explain in front of large public audiences how the people of Manchuria had tears in their eyes when the occupying Kwantung Army left China , so grateful were they to Japan . 
According to Watanabe , the Pacific War boiled down to race , as the US was determined to keep a non-white people down . 
Watanabe is thus the equivalent of a Holocaust denier , but , unlike his German counterparts , he easily draws large and sympathetic audiences . 
Moreover , there have been several disturbing recent incidents in which physical intimidation has been used by nationalists against critics of Koizumi &apos;s Yasukuni visits , such as the firebombing of former prime ministerial candidate Kato Koichi &apos;s home . 
This leaves the US in a difficult position . 
A number of American strategists are eager to ring China with a NATO-like defensive barrier , building outward from the US-Japan Security Treaty . 
Since the final days of the Cold War , the US has been pushing Japan to rearm , and has officially supported a proposed revision of Article 9 of the postwar constitution , which bans Japan from having a military or waging war . 
But America should be careful about what it wishes for . 
The legitimacy of the entire American military position in the Far East is built around the US exercising Japan &apos;s sovereign function of self-defense . 
Japan &apos;s unilateral revision of Article 9 , viewed against the backdrop of its new nationalism , would isolate Japan from virtually the whole of Asia . 
Revising Article 9 has long been part of Abe &apos;s agenda , but whether he pushes ahead with it will depend in large part on the kind of advice he gets from close friends in the US . 
President Bush was unwilling to say anything about Japan &apos;s new nationalism to his &quot; good friend Junichiro &quot; out of gratitude for Japanese support in Iraq . 
Now that Japan has withdrawn its small contingent of troops , perhaps Bush will speak plainly to Abe .
