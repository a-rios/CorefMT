Opening China , Then and Now 
WASHINGTON , DC - America &apos;s opening to China by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in 1971-1972 was a historic breakthrough . 
Less famous , but of equal importance , was the next major step , taken by Jimmy Carter exactly 30 years ago , establishing full diplomatic relations between China and the United States . 
As they left office in 1977 , President Gerald Ford and Kissinger left behind an incomplete and therefore unstable relationship with China . 
The US still recognized Taiwan , under the name of The Republic of China , as the legitimate and sole government of China . 
Official communications were very limited , and annual bilateral trade was under $ 1 billion . 
( Today , it is a staggering $ 387 billion . ) 
Carter took office hoping to normalize relations with China . 
Some saw this as a simple acknowledgement of reality , but in fact it was a momentous step that required diplomatic skill and political courage . 
A way would have to be found for the US , while recognizing China , to continue dealing with the government on Taiwan without recognizing their claim to represent China ; most important , the US had to retain the right to sell arms to Taiwan . 
From a political point of view , there was the famed Taiwan lobby , one of the most powerful in the US , still dominated by the conservative wing of American politics . &amp; 
Led by America &apos;s &quot; Mr. Conservative , &quot; Senator Barry Goldwater , and the leading contender for the 1980 Republican nomination , Ronald Reagan , the Taiwan lobby would fight normalization all the way . 
( Goldwater took the US government to the Supreme Court to challenge , unsuccessfully , Carter &apos;s action ; 
The saga unfolded over the first two years of the Carter administration , entirely out of public view , except for two important trips to China , one by Secretary of State Cyrus Vance , the other by National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski . 
Incredibly , those of us involved in the process ( I was then Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs ) managed to keep our intense negotiations completely secret . &amp; 
The Chinese demanded a complete severing of all official ties between Taiwan and the US , including arms sales . 
Knowing that such a move would provoke an enormous backlash domestically , we looked for a formula for continuing official contacts and arms sales with Taiwan even after we had de-recognized them and terminated the mutual security treaty ratified during the Eisenhower years . 
There was no precedent for this in American or international law . 
With advice from Eisenhower &apos;s former Attorney General , Herbert Brownell , State Department lawyers drafted the Taiwan Relations Act , a law like no other in American history , which allowed the US government to conduct business with Taiwan , including arms sales , without recognition . 
But when we explained to China why this was necessary in order to recognize them , they balked . 
They wanted trade and other benefits of recognition , which would benefit both nations in those Cold War days , when China was fiercely hostile to the Soviet Union , with which it had almost gone to war only a few years earlier . 
But Taiwan remained a huge , seemingly impossible obstacle . 
The breakthrough came in late 1978 , and was carefully timed by Carter to follow the mid-term congressional elections . 
The most important factor in the breakthrough was probably the emergence of Deng Xiaoping as China &apos;s new paramount leader . 
( Mao had died in 1976 ) . 
Deng , who had been forced to wear a dunce cap and denounce himself during the insanity of the Cultural Revolution , had achieved the greatest comeback imaginable , and in the fall of 1978 , he finally got enough power to cut a deal with the US : China would not &quot; agree &quot; to American arms sales or other activities with Taiwan , but they would proceed with normalization anyway . 
It was a classic example of Chinese negotiating style : firm on principle , flexible on specifics . 
I am leaving a lot out here - this was a very complicated negotiation - but that was the essence of it . 
In January 1979 , Deng made his historic trip to the US , which began with a private dinner at Brzezinski &apos;s house and climaxed with the most sought-after State dinner of the Carter years ( also remarkable for Richard Nixon &apos;s first visit to Washington since he had resigned ; 
At Brzezinski &apos;s house , Deng talked of his dreams for a China that he knew he would not live to see . 
He believed China could leapfrog the lost years in which the world had passed it by , but only with American support . 
He was ready to cooperate on containing the Soviet Union , even agreeing to the installation of secret American intelligence listening posts along China &apos;s border to track Soviet missiles . 
Deng accurately foresaw a vast exchange of students , modern technology , and trade . 
More than any American official , he anticipated what the American opening to China would accomplish . 
But even Deng could not fully imagine what would be unleashed by that announcement of December 15 , 1978 - nothing less than the development of the most important bilateral relationship in the world today .
