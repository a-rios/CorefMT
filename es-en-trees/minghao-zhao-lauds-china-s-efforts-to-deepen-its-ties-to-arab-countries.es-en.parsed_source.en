China &apos;s Arab March 
BEIJING - The growing bloodshed in Iraq and Syria is being watched as keenly in China as anywhere else in the world . 
Indeed , the greater Middle East is becoming an ever greater focus of Chinese foreign policy . 
At the just-concluded sixth ministerial conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum , held in Beijing , Chinese President Xi Jinping called upon his Arab counterparts to upgrade their strategic relationships with China , by deepening bilateral cooperation in areas ranging from finance and energy to space technology . 
This reflects China &apos;s broader goal - established partly in response to America &apos;s &quot; pivot &quot; toward Asia - of rebalancing its strategic focus westward , with an emphasis on the Arab world . 
Of course , economic ties between China and Arab countries have been growing stronger for more than a decade , with the trade volume increasing from $ 25.5 billion in 2004 to $ 238.9 billion in 2013 . 
China is now the Arab world &apos;s second-largest trading partner , and the largest trading partner for nine Arab countries . 
Within ten years , the volume of China-Arab trade is expected to reach $ 600 billion . 
Engineering contracts and investment have also enhanced ties . 
Under Xi &apos;s leadership , China is attempting to reshape its relationships with Arab countries according to its new &quot; march west &quot; strategic framework . 
The most notable component of this strategy is the &quot; Silk Road economic belt , &quot; which is to run along the ancient Central Asian Silk Road and the modern maritime Silk Road - an initiative that Xi promoted heavily at the recent meeting in Beijing . 
This effort highlights China &apos;s goal of establishing hub-and-spoke relationships with key developing economies around it . 
Unsurprisingly , energy has been a key factor in economic ties with the Arab world . 
From 2004 to 2013 , China &apos;s crude oil imports from Arab countries grew by more than 12 % annually , on average , reaching 133 million tons per year . 
As the director of the State Council &apos;s Development Research Center , Li Wei , pointed out in February , at the current rate , China will be consuming 800 million tons of oil annually , and importing 75 % of its petroleum , by 2030 . 
In this sense , China &apos;s trajectory contrasts sharply with that of the United States , where the rapid growth in output of shale oil and gas , together with energy-saving measures , has brought energy independence closer than ever - a point that President Barack Obama emphasized in his most recent State of the Union address . 
In fact , according to the US Energy Information Administration , China surpassed the US as the world &apos;s largest net oil importer earlier this year . 
Moreover , the US is gradually disengaging strategically from the greater Middle East , creating a vacuum that China seeks to fill . 
To succeed , China will need to become more attentive to the region &apos;s complex dynamics ; find creative ways to participate in conflict-resolution efforts ; and respond enthusiastically to Middle Eastern governments &quot; growing desire to connect to Asia . 
Doing so would enable China &apos;s leaders to advance their goal of developing the country &apos;s vast inland regions . 
Enhanced influence in the Arab world would also promote the perception of China as a leader of the developing world - a position that could boost China &apos;s strategic and economic resilience considerably . 
For starters , it would enable China to capitalize on the demographic heft of the developing world , which will house more than 80 % of the world &apos;s population in 2020 . 
Moreover , it would allow China to maximize its gains from burgeoning trade among developing economies , which surged from 8 % of global trade in 1990 to 24 % in 2011 . 
To be sure , not all Arab governments are welcoming China with open arms . 
Indeed , many of the Middle East &apos;s most powerful actors - including Turkey and Saudi Arabia - are suspicious of China &apos;s long-term intentions . 
But China can take steps to gain these countries &quot; trust . 
For example , China &apos;s leaders should work to address the unrest in the Muslim-dominated province of Xinjiang more effectively . 
Clearly , China &apos;s rising clout is no longer confined to Asia . 
China &apos;s &quot; march west &quot; into the Arab world is a bold effort to translate its economic might into enduring regional - and , ultimately , global - influence . 
This is a daunting task , but it is one that can not only help to secure China &apos;s long-term future , but perhaps bring greater weight to bear in resolving the region &apos;s immense challenges .
