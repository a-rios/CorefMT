Towards a Green Nanotechnology 
The advent of nanotechnology , the branch of engineering that seeks to build objects molecule by molecule - indeed , atom by atom - has evoked futuristic images of self-replicating &quot; nanobots &quot; that perform surgery , or that convert the planet into a mass of &quot; grey goo &quot; as they consume everything in sight . 
These two scenarios follow a familiar story line : technological progress , such as the development of nuclear power , genetically modified organisms , information technologies , and synthetic organic chemistry , first promises salvation , but then threatens doom as the consequences , often environmental , become apparent . 
Even disinfecting water - the single most important technological advance ever in prolonging human life - turns out to produce carcinogenic byproducts . 
The cycle of fundamental discovery , technological development , revelation of undesirable consequences , and public aversion appears unbreakable . 
Will nanotechnology be different ? 
Along with the early euphoria and hype that typically surround the rollout of new technologies , nanotechnology has been the subject of projections concerning its possible environmental risks well before its wide-scale commercialization . 
Raising such questions when nanotechnology is still in its infancy may result in better , safer products and less long-term liability for industry . 
The rapidly developing nanomaterials industry is the nanotechnology that is most likely to affect our lives first . 
A 2003 estimate by the Nanobusiness Alliance identified nanomaterials as the largest single category of nanotech start-ups . 
In the environmental technology industry alone , nanomaterials will enable new means of reducing the production of wastes , using resources more sparingly , cleaning up industrial contamination , providing potable water , and improving the efficiency of energy production and use . 
Commercial applications of nanomaterials currently or soon to be available include nano-engineered titania particles for sunscreens and paints , carbon nanotube composites in tires , silica nanoparticles as solid lubricants , and protein-based nanomaterials in soaps , shampoos , and detergents . 
The production , use , and disposal of nanomaterials will inevitably lead to their appearance in air , water , soils , or organisms . 
Research is needed to ensure that nanomaterials , and the industry that produces them , evolve as environmental assets rather than liabilities . 
Unfortunately , little is known about the potential environmental impacts of nanomaterials . 
Ironically , the properties of nanomaterials that may create concern , such as nanoparticle uptake by cells , are often precisely the properties desired for beneficial uses in medical applications . 
For example , ten years of studies of the possible health effects of a class of carbon-based nanomaterials known as fullerenes report that the soccer-ball-shaped fullerene molecules known as &quot; buckyballs , &quot; are powerful antioxidants , comparable in strength to vitamin E. Other studies report that some types of buckyballs can be toxic to tumor cells . 
Two recent studies concluded that buckyballs could impair brain functions in fish and were highly toxic to human-tissue cultures . 
A subsequent study of fullerene toxicity found no significant toxicity for buckyballs , but did observe a toxic response in cell cultures to a second group of fullerenes , called &quot; single-wall nanotubes . &quot; 
At this point , the question of the possible toxicity of fullerene nanomaterials remains largely unanswered . 
Determining whether a substance is &quot; dangerous &quot; involves determining not only the material &apos;s toxicity , but the degree to which it will ever come into contact with a living cell . 
Toxicity can be evaluated by putting buckyballs into a fish tank , but we must also find out whether buckyballs would ever actually arrive in a real world &quot; fish tank &quot; such as a lake or river . 
We do know that when materials resist degradation , they may be present in the environment for long periods of time , and thus have a greater chance of interacting with the living environment . 
But processes that may lead to the breakdown of nanomaterials , including degradation by bacteria , are virtually unexplored . 
Moreover , like toxicity and persistence , little is known about how nanoparticles are likely to move about in the environment . The most dangerous nanomaterials would be those that are both mobile and toxic . 
The fullerenes that have been the focus of early toxicity studies are among the least mobile of the nanomaterials we have studied to date . 
Our initial work on nanomaterial mobility in formations resembling groundwater aquifers or sand filters has shown that while one type of nanomaterial may be very mobile , a second may stay put . 
Thus , each nanomaterial may behave differently . 
Concerns over nanomaterials &quot; possible effects on health and the environment have perhaps overshadowed the pressing need to ensure that their production is clean and environmentally benign . 
Indeed , many of the ingredients used to make nanomaterials are currently known to present risks to human health . 
An encouraging trend is that the methods used to produce nanomaterials often become &quot; greener &quot; as they move from the laboratory to industrial production . 
Setting aside the issue of nanomaterials &quot; toxicity , preliminary results suggest that fabricating nanomaterials entails risks that are less than or comparable to those associated with many current industrial activities . 
It would be na√Øve to imagine that nanotechnology will evolve without risks to our health and environment . 
While attempting to halt the development of nanomaterial-inspired technologies would be as irresponsible as it is unrealistic , responsible development of these technologies demands vigilance and social commitment . 
Environmentally safe nanotechnology will come at a cost in time , money , and political capital .
