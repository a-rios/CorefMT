Asia &apos;s Military Revolution 
SEOUL - A vast revolution in military affairs is taking place across East Asia . 
The latest signs are Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s purge of General Xu Caihou , an ex-Politburo member and former vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission , on charges of corruption , and Japan &apos;s &quot; reinterpretation &quot; of Article 9 of its constitution to permit the country to provide military aid to its allies . 
Despite the rising regional tensions that inspired these moves , China &apos;s relations with its neighbors and the United States are not fated to lead to direct confrontation . 
But the relentless march of new initiatives to meet the perceived &quot; China threat &quot; will require the region &apos;s political leaders , including the Chinese , to address their disputes in new and more creative ways if that outcome is to be avoided . 
In general , there are three ways to foster international peace : deepening economic interdependence , promoting democracy , and building international institutions . 
Unfortunately , because East Asia &apos;s political leaders have failed to pursue the latter objective , they now find themselves playing dangerous balance-of-power games reminiscent of Europe a century ago . 
Deepening economic interdependence in the wake of Asia &apos;s 1997 financial crisis has not generated political momentum for peace and cooperation . 
The region &apos;s business leaders have been unable to prevent deteriorating foreign relations from harming their interests . 
By contrast , military lobbying now deeply influences foreign and defense policies - witness China &apos;s double-digit increase in defense spending and rising US arms sales in the region . 
What explains this failure ? 
International-relations theorists since Immanuel Kant have held that democracies rarely ( if ever ) fight one another ; as a result , political leaders , such as US President Woodrow Wilson , have tried to promote democracy as a means to spread peace . 
Until recently , the US seemed to have assumed that China &apos;s engagement with Western democracies would bolster peaceful ties . 
But , since the 2008 financial crisis , China &apos;s confidence in its authoritarian development model has grown stronger . 
Its leaders now increasingly appear to believe that a new &quot; Beijing Consensus &quot; of mercantilism and state intervention has replaced the old &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; of free trade and deregulation . 
China &apos;s ideological incompatibility with the US thus is making the shift in their relative power difficult to achieve peacefully . 
In the late nineteenth century , a rising US was able to cooperate with a declining Britain , owing to their shared culture and values . 
China &apos;s leaders , however , tend to suspect that the US is deliberately trying to undermine their country &apos;s political stability by questioning its record on human rights and political freedoms . 
Meanwhile , Xi &apos;s domestic policies seem to be taking the country ever further from Western norms . 
It is this ideological divide that is undermining the development in East Asia of institutions that establish principles , rules , and decision-making procedures for the region . 
While much of the West is bound together by institutions like the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe and NATO , East Asia &apos;s main body , the ASEAN Regional Forum , is too weak to play an analogous role , leaving the region beset with unregulated rivalries . 
So far , US and East Asian leaders have done little beyond offering rhetorical support for the creation of multilateral security institutions . 
With the exception of the almost defunct six-party talks aimed at eliminating the nuclear threat posed by North Korea , Asia &apos;s powers refuse to be constrained by international rules or norms . 
Instead , East Asia &apos;s leaders resort to realpolitik . 
Unfortunately , unlike Europe &apos;s nineteenth-century political masterminds - figures like Talleyrand , Metternich , Bismarck , and Disraeli - who crafted durable international alliances , Asia lacks leaders willing and able to look beyond their narrow national interests . 
For example , China &apos;s leaders seem to believe that the 2008 economic crisis and the high costs of two foreign wars have left the US in no position to exercise international leadership . 
That may explain China &apos;s recent foreign-policy assertiveness , particularly in its dispute with Japan over control of the Senkaku / Diaoyu Islands , which could be intended to probe the strength of the US-Japan alliance . 
Testing US power in this way could prove to be a dangerous miscalculation . 
Though weakened economically , the US remains a military superpower . 
Its interests in East Asia date back to the late nineteenth century . 
Just as Britain refused to concede naval supremacy to Germany a century ago , the US will not easily accept any Chinese challenge to its strategic position in the western Pacific , especially given that so many East Asian states are pleading for US protection . 
China and the US need to talk . 
Despite their economic interdependence and some 90 inter-governmental channels for bilateral dialogue , the two superpowers are caught in a perilous tug-of-war over interests in the East and South China Seas and the western Pacific . 
Sino-Japanese relations are particularly fraught , with two decades of economic stagnation in Japan and rapid growth in China fueling nationalist overreaction on both sides . 
Having become accustomed to outsourcing its security to the US , and despite having the world &apos;s third-largest economy , Japan neglected to develop its own constructive diplomatic vision . 
It remains to be seen whether Abe &apos;s constitutional reinterpretation , cloaked in the language of regional cooperation , advances such a new vision . 
It does not help that the US wants Japan to shoulder more of the burden of maintaining Asia &apos;s security , a position that may make sense strategically and financially , but that betrays a lack of understanding of the political context . 
The US seems to underestimate regional concerns over Japan &apos;s potential remilitarization . 
By providing Japan with a diplomatic carte blanche , the US may find itself hostage to Japanese interests , with the result that Japan becomes part of Asia &apos;s security problem , not part of its solution . 
Asia-Pacific leaders must shake off their complacency . 
Serious efforts and far-reaching compromises are needed to begin the process of building institutions for regional security cooperation . 
Otherwise , the much-heralded &quot; Asian century , &quot; far from bringing economic prosperity and peace , will be an age of suspicion and peril .
