Welcome to the Era of Incompetence 
Two diametrically opposed scenarios exist for what will happen to global real interest rates over the next generation . 
Those who predict generally low interest rates over the next generation point to rapid growth of productivity and potential output in the world economy . 
According to this view , the principal problem faced by central banks will not be restraining demand as it shoots above potential , but boosting demand as it lags behind potential . 
They point to the fact that the world &apos;s major central banks - the Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank , and the Bank of Japan - have so firmly established their anti-inflation credibility that the inflation risk premium has been wrung out of interest rates . 
Believers in low interest rates also emphasize shifts in income distribution in the United States away from labor and toward capital , which have greatly boosted firms &apos; resources to finance investment internally and reduced their dependence on capital markets . 
They point to rapid technological progress , which has boosted output from new and old capital investments . 
With competition strong across the economy , they say that we can look forward to a generation of relatively high asset prices and relatively low real interest rates worldwide . 
By contrast , those who predict generally high real interest rates over the next generation point to low savings rates in the US , high spending driven by demographic burdens in Europe , and feckless governments running chronic deficits and unsustainable fiscal policies . 
Imagine a bunch of irresponsible Bush-like administrations making fiscal policy , forever . 
They also cite investment opportunities in emerging markets , and make the obvious point that if China and India stay on track , their economies &apos; relative weight in the world will double in the next decade or so , as rapid real growth is accompanied by appreciation in their real exchange rates . 
Sooner or later , the Chinese and Indian central banks &apos; desire to hold down exchange rates to boost exports and their rich citizens &apos; desire to keep their money in accounts at Bank of America will be offset by the sheer magnitude of investment opportunities . 
In this scenario , bond prices in post-industrial countries are heading for a serious fall - as are real estate prices in California , New York , and London . 
What , then , is an economist to do ? 
One could emulate J.P. Morgan , whose standard response to questions about stock prices , bond prices , and interest rates was to say simply , &quot; The market will fluctuate . &quot; 
Another alternative is to recall the late Rudi Dornbusch , who taught that any economist who forecasts interest rates based on fundamentals is a fool , because fundamentals are complex and unstable , shifting suddenly and substantially . 
Even if an economist correctly understands fundamentals , Dornbusch warned , that doesn &apos;t mean that markets do . 
In forecasting interest rates one is engaged not in examining fundamentals , but in predicting what average market opinion expects average market opinion about fundamentals to be . 
But Rudi never followed his own advice . 
So let me place my bet - which I think is only 60 % likely - and say that my best guess is that world real interest rates will be high over the next generation , and that current bond prices ( and real estate prices ) are not sustainable . 
Four features of modern politics in the world &apos;s post-industrial core lead me to this conclusion : 
路 In the US , the collapse of &quot; grownup &quot; Republicans in Congress - the extraordinary failure of fiscal conservatives to mount any effective opposition to the Bush administration &apos;s renewed destabilization of American government finances . 
The deficit orgy of the Reagan era is looking less like a freak political accident and more like a structural feature of Republican Party governance - what the modern Republican governing coalition tends to do whenever it gains power ; 
路 The parallel collapse of a grownup Republican presence in the executive branch . 
As Ron Suskind reports in his recent biography of Bush &apos;s first Treasury Secretary , Paul O &apos;Neill , former Bush Budget Director Mitch Daniels once whispered to himself at the end of a disastrous meeting , &quot; Not a typical Republican package . 
But Daniels decided he would rather run for office in Indiana than take a stand in support of sound fiscal finance ; 
路 The failure of Western European governments to even begin to think about how to address the coming fiscal crisis of the social-insurance state as a result of their aging populations ; 
路 The inability of Western European governments to enact sufficiently bold liberalizing reforms to create the possibility of full employment , together with the failure of western European monetary policy to be sufficiently stimulative to create the reality of full employment . 
The arguments for low interest rates seem to me to require a degree of government competence that is unlikely , given political parties &apos; current positions and the existing structure of the institutions that make fiscal policy . 
I hope to be surprised . 
I hope to see governments in Western Europe and the US face up to their responsibilities and conduct sensible , sustainable fiscal policies . 
But that is my hope , not my forecast .
