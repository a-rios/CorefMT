How to Target Iraq 
In the current debate about policy towards Iraq , two extreme alternatives are usually presented : either extend the military campaign against terrorism to Iraq , or maintain the current uneasy status quo with that country . 
Pious talk about reworking the UN sanctions is another version of the second alternative - that is , of doing nothing . 
Both alternatives are unpalatable . 
Yet preparing a ground war against Iraq - finishing off the unfinished business of the 1991 Gulf War - is a high risk strategy . 
Arab countries , already questionable allies in the war against fellow Muslims in Afghanistan , will be even less reliable in a war against fellow Arabs . 
The Europeans , let alone the Russians , may demure . 
The military odds appear daunting . 
Still , letting the status quo continue is equally problematic . 
It means that the Iraqi people will continue to suffer - both from Saddam &apos;s brutalities , as well as from the consequences of the sanctions caused by his continued rule . 
Moreover , it would continue to send the wrong message to would-be terrorists : you can get away with murder . 
The perceived weakness of the US after the embassy bombings in East Africa and the attack on the destroyer the USS Cole no doubt contributed to the audacity of the attacks of September 11 th . 
Other options , however , do exist and a combination of them could help bring down Saddam without necessarily engaging in outright military action . 
First , local forces opposed to Saddam should be encouraged . 
By this I do not mean the loudmouthed but totally ineffective so-called Iraqi Opposition . 
The local forces to be encouraged - by special operations people and the provision of arms and training - are the leaders of the southern Shi &apos;a and the northern Kurds . 
In the latter case , the infrastructure for support already exists , though it was partially dismantled during the Clinton administration . 
In the Shi &apos;a south , still reeling from the brutal suppression of the ill-fated 1991 rebellion , contacts must be created and networks established . 
Iraq &apos;s neighbors - Saudi Arabia in the south and Turkey in the north - must be reassured that Shi &apos;a and Kurdish rebellion will not result in the dismantling of Iraq and a change of borders : both countries have legitimate concerns regarding this issue . 
With the current much more open regime in Teheran , Riyadh can also be convinced that the dangers from an Iranian-controlled Shi &apos;a entity in southern Iraq are less formidable now than they were in 1991 . 
On the other hand , the cozy relationship that now exists between Jordan and Saddam must be addressed , with all sensitivity to Jordan &apos;s dilemmas . 
The Iraqi politico-military elite must be both targeted and approached . 
Saddam has been masterful at filling most crucial positions in the army and security services with people who come from his Tikriti clan . 
But they are far from being a monolithic group : enmity , jealously , anger over the past brutalities and injustices visited upon many of their kin may make some generals and colonels open to suggestions of a coup . 
Those suggestions should be premised on a two level approach : first , the US , with UN support , should create a war crimes tribunal to judge Saddam and his top generals : they should know that come the day of reckoning , they will be hunted down like Milosevic and his minions . 
One major indictment should deal with the use of poison gas against Kurdish rebels in Halabja during the time of the Iran / Iraq war . 
Parallel to this , and the encouragement of insurrections in Iraq &apos;s south and the north , preparations for a military option should be credibly enhanced . 
But with the stick should come a carrot : with good intelligence , some Iraqi generals and colonels should be approached with offers of amnesty and support should they decide to try to topple Saddam . 
Failure to act , they should be told in no uncertain terms , will leave them exposed ( like Saddam ) to an indictment by in an international war crimes tribunal once Saddam &apos;s rule is brought to an end . 
They should also be offered the lifting of sanctions on Iraq provided that they - after getting rid of Saddam - accept the resumption of a UN inspection regime . 
Even if this will not immediately bring Saddam &apos;s regime down , such active attempts at undermining his rule will certainly make Saddam nervous , and as Ceausescu and Milosevic have shown , nervous dictators make fatal mistakes . 
One premise underlies this entire line of thought : to imagine that there is a democratic alternative to Saddam , or that once he disappears there will be a democratic transition in Iraq , is to entertain dangerous illusions . 
The only alternative to Saddam &apos;s regime is some sort of military rule , but one less oppressive and relatively more open . 
It must certainly be committed to a foreign and internal policy not based on terrorism and thuggery and a Saddam-like quest for weapons of mass destruction . 
Here , undoubtedly , is a complicated strategy , and one with its own inherent pitfalls . 
One key advantage of it is that such an approach has a real chance of gaining support , albeit sometimes tacit , from Arab countries - and from Europe and Russia as well . 
Such a calibrated approach , however , combining a differentiated understanding of the nature of Saddam &apos;s regime and its weaknesses , has a better chance of success than an outright assault , or the dangers inherent in allowing Saddam to remain in power . 
The successes in Afghanistan call for an equally nuanced and sophisticated approach in regard to Iraq .
