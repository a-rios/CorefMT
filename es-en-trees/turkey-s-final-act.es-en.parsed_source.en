Turkey \ u0027s Final Act ? 
CAMBRIDGE : Turkey has been escaping trouble seemingly forever . 
As an escape artist , indeed , it even beats Brazil ! 
But the bill for this bravura performance keeps growing : high and rising debt , high and rising deficits , very high inflation . 
All are symptoms of Turkey &apos;s perverted politics . 
Dodgy politics usually means four things : first , cover up and avoid government transparency like the pest that it is for wayward politicians . 
Second , procrastinate on all but inevitable adjustments , because reform , restructuring and cleaning up financial messes never attracts new cronies . 
Third , keep spending and paying off anyone who risks upsetting the process . 
Lastly , don &apos;t take too dogmatic a view of corruption and or the looting of the public coffers ; they are part of the system . 
Remember , corruption keeps things stable . 
An IMF program in 2000 was meant to offer a framework for Turkey to work its way out of its troubles . 
But as is the way with exchange rate-based programs , interest rates were indeed brought down and imports made cheap , creating a boom that undermined the viability of the disinflation strategy . 
What politician , after all , says no to a boom ? 
Act I started last December , with a financial crisis to blow Turkey &apos;s cozily corrupt system wide open . 
In haste , the IMF arrived on the scene , waving $ 10 billion at the problem . 
It soon seemed to have restored some normality . 
Not quite , because interest rates remained high and creditors remained alarmed . 
The precariousness of the situation called for early and dramatic declines in interest rates driven by an early restoration in confidence . 
In February , however , the opposite happened : political support for the IMF program broke down when President and Prime Minister had a shouting match . 
Act II began with a renewed speculative attack and a deep collapse of the currency . 
Turkey has imported an economics minister from the World Bank - Kemal Dervis , an able man , though not someone very familiar with the speculative financiers preying on the country . 
When Brazil hit the ropes , it imported Arminio Fraga , a senior trader for the financier George Soros , who quickly imposed himself and accomplished miracles . 
The same may happen in Turkey but its politics are harder and public finances far more troublesome . 
Hence the skepticism , hence the expectation that Act III may open soon . 
Turkey entered its crisis with a woeful budget and a very high public debt . 
It has since added formidably to its debt liabilities . 
Estimates suggest that cleaning up the banking system would eat up some 25 % of GDP in extra public debt ( about $ 40 billion ) , over and above the 60 % already in place . 
Why an increase in public debt ? 
Because who else will pay for cleaning up Turkey &apos;s banks ? 
If postponed , moreover , costs will rise . 
At this point two complications come together . 
First , in order to stem the inflationary impact of a currency collapse , the central bank imposes extremely high real interest rates . 
Of course , that makes the budget deficit larger and keeps debt growing fast . 
It also means that private debts quickly become unpayable , more so because a recession is coming . 
In turn , that means the bank clean up will cost more and more and that public debts will grow more and more . 
What happens in the end ? 
Another blow up . 
Turkey &apos;s public debt is simply unpayable . 
Neither the G7 , the IMF nor the World Bank will pay it off . 
There are two ways Turkey &apos;s debt can go . 
First , it can be inflated away - a currency collapse fed by money creation until the debt disappears in a whirl of inflation . 
Historically , this is what happens in countries weighed down by large debts . 
Of course , the social consequences are deeply traumatic ; witness Europe in the 1920s . 
The alternative is for government to write down public debt and bank deposits , giving creditors and depositors &quot; hair cuts . &quot; 
Politically that is more deliberate and therefore very unlikely . 
So how is the Turkish government dealing with the inevitable ? 
By not dealing with it ! 
Avoiding reality is always a short term option . 
But stalling only assures that debts will grow , economic normalization is postponed and the final explosion at the end of ACT III even bigger . 
There is no EMU-trick , such as that which benefited Italy a few years ago , that will defuse the situation . 
There is no volunteer like Germany or the US Treasury willing to dip into its deep pockets . 
Turkey is on a path to a dramatic financial crash that risks throwing the country out of its precarious political situation and into the unknown . 
Historically very nasty answers emerge in such situations . 
Turkey is already formidably divided , so look for a strong man to ride in , probably on a tank . 
What could avoid this ? 
Immediate debt restructuring on a grand scale , biting the bullet and accepting a few painful years of retrenchment . 
That , however , is not the kind of message elected Prime Ministers want to hear .
