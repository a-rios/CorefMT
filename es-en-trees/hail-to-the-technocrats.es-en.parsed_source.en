Hail to the Technocrats 
COPENHAGEN - Is the European Union &apos;s supposed &quot; democratic deficit &quot; now spreading to individual European countries in the wake of the sovereign-debt crisis ? 
The rise of unelected technocrats to political power in Greece and Italy suggests , at least superficially , that the old taboo against technocratic governments pursuing an EU-dictated agenda has been shattered . 
Consider Italy . 
Most Italians breathed a collective sigh of relief that three-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is being replaced by a technocrat par excellence , former European Commissioner Mario Monti , a respected economist . 
Greece , too , is turning over the reigns of government to an unelected , and supposedly apolitical , technocrat , Lucas Papademos , a former vice president of the European Central Bank . 
Of course , there are many things wrong with the EU nowadays , but a widening of its so-called &quot; democratic deficit &quot; is not one of them . 
Indeed , that perceived deficit is something of a politically convenient canard . 
Scholars such as Princeton University &apos;s Andrew Moravcsik have long argued that the EU &apos;s legitimacy comes not from the ballot box , but from its ability to provide concrete benefits to citizens . 
What the EU achieves through integrating markets - or even eliminating passport controls - underscores the benefits of its &quot; delegated democracy . &quot; 
Indeed , it is precisely the Eurocrats &quot; detachment from everyday politics that has enabled the EU to deliver . 
Contrary to the ranting of Euroskeptic politicians in Britain and , increasingly , in eurozone member countries , the growing disenchantment of voters with politics reflects the distance that has grown between promises and results , not the distance between EU officials and member states &quot; citizens . 
According to an alarming poll published recently by the leading Italian newspaper La Repubblica , more than 22 % of Italians find no great differences between an authoritarian and a democratic system of government . 
Another 10 % believe that an authoritarian regime is better and more effective than a democratic political system . 
This disturbing decline of faith in democracy , which is not confined to Italy , brings us back to the powerful rationale underlying Europeans &quot; growing reliance on technocratic governance : security . 
From the end of World War II to the collapse of the Soviet Union , what brought Europeans closer together was not the dream of a Europe-wide , democratic polity , but , above all , their desire to be safe and secure . 
Throughout the post-war years , the narrative of European integration almost always focused on the quest for political , social , and economic security . 
With violent demonstrations in the streets of Athens , Madrid , and Rome , it is not hard to understand why some people may once again choose to give priority to their security , particularly their economic security . 
Europe &apos;s technocrats worked in the service of security ahead of the EU &apos;s enlargement in 2004 to the former communist states of Central Europe . 
The EU &apos;s bureaucracy played a key part in helping those countries to navigate the complex transition from socialist autocracy to capitalist democracy . 
At the time , few people acknowledged this , because Eurocrats rarely make headlines . 
The unwritten rule in Europe seems to be that , the more depoliticized the process , the more legitimacy technocrats can earn . 
One objection to delegating political authority to technocrats is that such appointments amount to a humiliating constraint on sovereignty . 
In normal times , that is unacceptable to most citizens . 
Monti , for example , was among the first to sound the alarm about Italy &apos;s dire finances . 
Monti called this podest√† forestiero , something of a foreign overlordship based in Brussels , Washington , and Frankfurt , as well as Berlin and Paris . 
The EU is a voluntary pooling of national sovereignty , but the demands now being made of Italy ( and Greece ) are the Diktat of other sovereign nations . 
A national-unity government run by a technocrat in place of an administration run by elected politicians does not qualitatively change the fact that outsiders are demanding reforms . 
Of course , a technocratic government is an anomaly to the extent that it constitutes a damning verdict on the performance of a country &apos;s entire political class . 
Lao Tzu , the founder of Taoism , wrote that &quot; a leader is best when people barely know he exists . &quot; 
With Europe &apos;s crisis-stricken governments increasingly turning to unelected technocrats , one can almost see citizens nodding in agreement .
