Angela Merkel &apos;s Vision Thing 
CAMBRIDGE - As Europe struggles to save the euro , the chorus of complaints about weak leadership in the world &apos;s major economies grows louder . 
Many have singled out German Chancellor Angela Merkel for failing to promote a vision of Europe similar to that of her predecessor and mentor , Helmut Kohl . 
Are the critics right ? 
Part of what effective leaders do is communicate a vision that gives meaning to policies and inspires others to support these policies ( and those who propose them ) . 
It is one of the ways in which leaders help to create shared objectives and energize common action . 
Usually , such a vision provides a scenario for the future that is meant to encourage change , though it may also portray the status quo - or the past - as attractive , thereby encouraging resistance to change . 
Either way , without a vision , it is difficult to lead others anywhere . 
Frederick Smith , CEO of Federal Express , has argued that &quot; the primary task of leadership is to communicate the vision and values of an organization . &quot; 
But one must be cautious about visions . 
Sometimes leaders think that vision can solve most of their problems , but the wrong vision - or an overly ambitious vision - can do damage . 
George H.W. Bush was faulted ( and faulted himself ) for not having what he called &quot; the vision thing . &quot; 
When pressed by his staff to speak more boldly and expansively , he replied , &quot; It &apos;s just not me . &quot; 
After the shock of the September 2001 terrorist attacks , his son , George W. Bush , developed a far more ambitious vision . 
As one former adviser put it , he was &quot; irresistibly drawn to Big Ideas like bringing democracy to the Middle East , Big Ideas that stood in sharp contrast to the prudent small ball played by his father . &quot; 
Yet the elder Bush turned out to have had the better foreign policy . 
Some aspiring leaders think that they must proclaim a vision that overawes their followers . 
In practice , however , a successful vision often arises from the needs of the group , which are then formulated and articulated by the leader . 
The vision that Martin Luther King , Jr . , expressed in his &quot; I Have a Dream &quot; speech , for example , was deeply rooted not only in America &apos;s professed values of equality and inclusion , but also in African-Americans &quot; experience of subordination and exclusion . 
At the same time , the pressure to articulate a vision can get a leader into difficulty . 
As one university president put it : &quot; Everyone asks , &quot; What &apos;s your vision ? &quot; 
But you offend many people and get into trouble by answering too quickly . 
The smart response at the beginning is , &quot; What do you think ? &quot; and then listen before you articulate your vision . &quot; 
A successful vision has to be attractive to various circles of followers and stakeholders . 
What plays well with one group may not sit well with another . 
Leaders must get the question right before proposing answers . 
To choose goals and articulate them in a vision , they need not only to solicit input from their followers , but also to understand the context of their choices . 
They must be able to assess reality accurately . 
The boldness of a vision varies with the type of leadership involved . 
Leaders of social movements can call forth larger visions than public officials can . 
A movement leader can promote a vision that is miles ahead of his followers , while a prime minister with multiple objectives and responsibilities must maintain a continuous dialogue with the public , which keeps him or her from moving too far ahead of citizens . 
After former US Vice President Al Gore lost his bid for the presidency in 2000 , he became a leader of the social movement to combat global climate change , and his style changed from pragmatic to inspirational and prophetic . 
Analysts judge a government leader &apos;s vision in terms of whether it creates a sensible balance between realism and risk , and whether it balances objectives with capabilities . 
Anyone can produce a wish list , but effective visions combine inspiration with feasibility . 
Critics of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair , for example , acknowledged that his ability to articulate a vision was one of his great strengths as a leader , but complained about his lack of attention to detail . 
Similarly , two twentieth-century US presidents , Woodrow Wilson and George W. Bush , were good at articulating an ambitious foreign-policy vision , but were poor at refining and reshaping their vision when they encountered implementation challenges . 
Both promoted democracy , but both did so in a manner that generated a backlash against democracy promotion . 
Of course , prudence is not enough . 
Sometimes leaders need to stretch the boundaries of realism to inspire their followers and call forth extra effort , as Winston Churchill did in Great Britain in 1940 . 
Like Franklin Roosevelt , who acted very cautiously in trying to persuade American opinion to abandon isolationism in the 1930 &quot; s , Merkel has proceeded cautiously on saving the euro . 
She faced public skepticism about using German funds to bail out the Greek economy . 
Her coalition was divided on the issue , and her party lost state elections . 
If she had acted more boldly , she might have lost even more support , but the steps that she agreed to remained insufficient to reassure markets . 
At the end of October , however , she finally articulated a vision of the future of Europe that persuaded the German Bundestag to agree to a package of measures to save the euro . 
Whether she waited too long - and whether her vision will prove convincing - will be determined in the coming months .
