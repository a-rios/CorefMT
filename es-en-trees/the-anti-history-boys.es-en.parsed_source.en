The Anti-History Boys 
BERKELEY - If you asked a modern economic historian like me why the world is currently in the grips of a financial crisis and a deep economic downturn , I would tell you that this is the latest episode in a long history of similar bubbles , crashes , crises , and recessions that date back at least to the canal-building bubble of the early 1820 &quot; s , the 1825-1826 failure of Pole , Thornton ampamp ; 
Co , and the subsequent first industrial recession in Britain . 
We have seen this process at work in many other historical episodes as well - in 1870 , 1890 , 1929 , and 2000 . 
For some reason , asset prices get way out of whack and rise to unsustainable levels . 
Sometimes the culprit is lousy internal controls in financial firms that over-reward subordinates for taking risk . 
Sometimes the cause is government guarantees . 
And sometimes it is simply a long run of good fortune , which leaves the market dominated by unrealistic optimists . 
Then the crash comes . 
And when it does , risk tolerance collapses : everybody knows that there are immense unrealized losses in financial assets and nobody is sure that they know where they are . 
The crash is followed by a flight to safety , which is followed by a steep fall in the velocity of money as investors hoard cash . 
And that fall in monetary velocity brings on a recession . 
I will not say that this is the pattern of all recessions ; it isn &apos;t . 
But I will say that this is the pattern of this recession , and that we have been here before . 
But if you ask the same question of a modern macroeconomist - for example , the extremely bright Narayana Kocherlakota of the University of Minnesota - you will find that he says that he does not know , and that macroeconomic models attribute economic downturns to various causes . 
Most , he points out , &quot; rely on some form of large quarterly movements in the technological frontier . 
Some have collective shocks to the marginal utility of leisure . 
Other models have large quarterly shocks to the depreciation rate in the capital stock ( in order to generate high asset price volatilities ) ... &quot; 
That is , downturns are either the result of a great forgetting of technological and organizational knowledge , a great vacation as workers suddenly develop a taste for extra leisure , or a great rusting as the speed at which oxygen corrodes accelerates , reducing the value of large things made out of metal . 
But modern macroeconomists will also say that all these models strike them as implausible stories that are not to be taken seriously . 
Indeed , according to Kocherlakota , nobody really believes them . : &quot; Macroeconomists use them only as convenient short-cuts to generate the requisite levels of volatility &quot; in their mathematical models . 
This leads me to ask two questions : 
First , is it really true that nobody believes these stories ? 
Ed Prescott of Arizona State University really does believe that large-scale recessions are caused by economy-wide episodes of forgetting the technological and organizational knowledge that underpin total factor productivity . 
One exception is the Great Depression , which Prescott says was caused by real wages far exceeding equilibrium values , owing to President Herbert Hoover &apos;s extraordinary pro-labor , pro-union policies . 
Likewise , Casey Mulligan of the University of Chicago really does appear to believe that large falls in the employment-to-population ratio are best seen as &quot; great vacations &quot; - and as the side-effect of destructive government policies like those in place today , which lead workers to quit their jobs so they can get higher government subsidies to refinance their mortgages . 
I find it incredible , too . ) 
Regardless of whether they have rejected our interpretations and understandings or simply have built or failed to build their own in ignorance of what we have done , why have they not used our work ? 
The second question is particularly disturbing . 
After all , economic theory should be grappling with economic history . 
Theory is crystallized history - it can be nothing more . 
Someone observes some instructive case or some anecdotal or empirical regularity , and says , &quot; This is interesting ; let &apos;s build a model of this . &quot; 
After the initial crystallization , theory does , of course , develop according to its own intellectual imperatives and processes , but the seed of history is still there . 
What happened to the seed ? 
This is not to say that the macroeconomic model-building of the past generation has been pointless . 
But I do think that modern macroeconomists need to be rounded up , on pain of loss of tenure , and sent to a year-long boot camp with the assembled monetary historians of the world as their drill sergeants . 
They need to listen to and learn from Dick Sylla about Alexander Hamilton &apos;s bank rescue of 1825 ; from Charlie Calomiris about the Overend , Gurney crisis ; from Michael Bordo about the first bankruptcy of Baring brothers ; and from Barry Eichengreen , Christy Romer , and Ben Bernanke about the Great Depression . 
If modern macroeconomists do not reconnect with history - if they do not realize just what their theories are crystallized out of and what the point of the enterprise is - then their profession will wither and die .
