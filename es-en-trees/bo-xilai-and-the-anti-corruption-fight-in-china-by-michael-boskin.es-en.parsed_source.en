The Global Stake in China &apos;s Anti-Corruption Reform 
STANFORD - The recent trial of Bo Xilai highlighted the biggest challenge facing contemporary China : the corruption and abuse of power by some government and party officials . 
Until his fall , Bo , a former Politburo member and party leader of Chongqing , a megacity of 30 million people , was a potential candidate for China &apos;s ruling seven-member Politburo Standing Committee . 
Bo &apos;s trial occurred at what is a critical moment for China . 
Millions of rural Chinese annually flood into the country &apos;s cities in search of employment ; but China &apos;s export-led growth , which previously masked the macroeconomic costs of corruption and excessive state intervention , is slowing . 
As China enters an era of more subdued growth amid increased competition from other low-cost countries , this damage will become increasingly apparent - and increasingly destructive . 
An economically successful China is more likely to be stable and geopolitically constructive ; a China beset by serious economic problems would be far less so , and , as the first-ever developing economy to become a global power , could even become a source of systemic risk . 
Chinese manufacturing assembly is integral to global supply chains for many products . 
Moreover , China is the largest holder of US Treasury securities ( aside from the Federal Reserve ) , has significant euro holdings , is likely soon to become America &apos;s largest trade partner , and looms large in trade with many European and Asian economies . 
Research reveals that strong enforcement of property rights and stable , predictable , and non-confiscatory tax and regulatory regimes are essential to long-run economic prosperity . 
The key to China &apos;s reform , and what the Chinese people want most , is John Adams &apos;s &quot; government of laws , not men &quot; - even-handed administration of reasonable laws , not special favors for the connected few . 
Indeed , Finance Minister Lou Jiwei echoed Adams ( and Adam Smith ) when he proclaimed , ... &quot; resources should be allocated by prices and markets , not government officials . &quot; 
Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that a crackdown on corruption is a top priority , and that unless it reaches both &quot; tigers &quot; ( higher-ups ) and &quot; flies &quot; ( lower-level officials ) , there may well not be another orderly leadership transition of the type that brought him to power earlier this year . 
Indeed , reducing corruption is essential if China is to join the small list of developing economies - Japan , South Korea , Singapore , Hong Kong , and Taiwan - that have escaped the &quot; middle-income trap &quot; that ensnares most developing countries and prevents them from attaining advanced-economy status . 
More than the unseemliness and capriciousness of many officials &quot; behavior , this is what is really at stake in Xi &apos;s anti-corruption campaign . 
China &apos;s future prosperity requires restricting government officials &quot; administrative discretion , reducing state-owned enterprises &quot; power and subsidies , and strengthening the rule of law by developing an independent judiciary . 
But these reforms imply a change in culture and incentives . 
Some officials use their considerable discretion in granting licenses , permits , and contracts to solicit favors and side payments . 
The fortune accumulated by Bo &apos;s wife ( reliance on proxies , especially relatives , is a common tactic of corrupt officials everywhere ) highlights the opportunities for the well connected to get ahead . 
Many Chinese , regarding this as just the way things are , behave accordingly . 
To be sure , rent-seeking and favor-dispensing corruption exist to some degree everywhere ; but they are more widespread in developing than developed countries and in resource-rich and / or centrally planned economies than in capitalist democracies . 
The time and other resources that individuals and firms devote to seeking government favors would be far more valuable if redirected to producing goods and services . 
Some promising anti-corruption ideas have successful antecedents in Chinese history , from the Ming Dynasty to modern Hong Kong . 
Under the Ming Dynasty , the emperor &apos;s officials came from other provinces and were frequently rotated . 
To protect China &apos;s central bank from local political pressure , reformist Premier Zhu Rongji , on my and others &quot; advice in the 1990 &quot; s , reorganized the People &apos;s Bank of China along regional lines , similar to the Federal Reserve &apos;s district banks . 
In Hong Kong , corruption was so pervasive as late as the 1970 &quot; s - if your house was on fire , the fire department demanded payment before pumping water ! - that an independent anti-corruption commission was appointed specifically to investigate and prosecute both public and private corruption . 
Hong Kong greatly reduced corruption and improved administration with an amnesty , pay increases , and financial-disclosure requirements for officials . 
China &apos;s current leaders should revisit these precedents . 
A truly independent judiciary will take time to establish , but some judges can be appointed and paid by - and report to - the central government rather than local officials . 
And , as in Ming China , judges and other officials could be rotated every few years . 
Likewise , as in Hong Kong , an amnesty could be granted , conditional on financial disclosure and a fine for &quot; unexplainable wealth , &quot; for all but the most egregious behavior , thereby leaving the past behind . 
At that point , judges &quot; and government officials &quot; pay could be raised to competitive levels , which would weaken the incentive to continue corrupt practices - particularly if officials must regularly file financial-disclosure statements and are penalized for withholding information . 
The recent willingness of ordinary Chinese to condemn corruption publicly is a harbinger , one hopes , of real anti-corruption reforms from the country &apos;s new leadership . 
An independent judiciary , financial disclosure by government officials , and other independent institutions have been essential to limiting and forestalling - though not fully eliminating - corruption in the United States and most other advanced capitalist democracies . 
That is a lesson that China needs to learn far more quickly than some members of its entrenched elite will find comfortable .
