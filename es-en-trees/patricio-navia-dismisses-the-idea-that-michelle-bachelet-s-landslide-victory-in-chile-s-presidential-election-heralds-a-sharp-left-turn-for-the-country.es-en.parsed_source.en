The Return of Bachelet 
SANTIAGO - Michelle Bachelet &apos;s landslide victory in Chile &apos;s recent presidential election represents a mandate that many political leaders could only envy . 
In 2010 , Bachelet completed her first four-year term as president with an 80 % approval rating . 
Her fiscally responsible economic policies , combined with a strong focus on poverty-alleviating social programs , allowed her government to weather the global financial crisis of 2008 . 
Still , after 20 years in power , her left-wing Concertación coalition was defeated in the presidential election that year by the center-right candidate , Sebastián Piñera . 
Now , after a single term of an economically successful but unpopular Piñera government , Chileans have returned Bachelet to power . 
In addition to being Chile &apos;s first woman president , Bachelet is the first president since 1938 to be elected to a second term , and her margin of victory - 62 % to 38 % - over the right-wing candidate , Evelyn Matthei , set a new record . 
Bachelet will not have the luxury of a honeymoon . 
During the presidential campaign , as the candidate of the New Majority coalition - the old Concertación plus the Communist Party and other small leftist groups - she made specific commitments that helped raise expectations . 
Though the government &apos;s program is likely to be less ambitious and qualify many of her campaign promises , the poor and lower middle class - her main electoral base - expect that she will move swiftly , for example , to end for-profit elementary and secondary education and offer free universal tertiary education . 
Bachelet has also vowed to reform the tax system to reduce inequality , strengthen the state &apos;s role in the pension system , and improve the quality and coverage of the health-care system . 
She has even promised a new constitution . 
But , though Bachelet &apos;s coalition has a clear majority in Congress , supermajority requirements will force her to bargain with the right-wing opposition to pass her reforms . 
In addition , because her own coalition includes parties from the far left to the center , Bachelet will need to broker compromises with her allies . 
Moreover , hard times will mean hard choices . 
After four years of rapid growth and almost full employment under Piñera , the economy is slowing . 
The falling price of copper , Chile &apos;s main export commodity , suggests what lies ahead . 
After campaigning on a promise to redistribute wealth , Bachelet will have to focus on fostering growth and job creation . 
As the economic outlook worsens , voters &quot; priorities will shift from broadening access to high-quality education and health care to promoting employment . 
Bachelet &apos;s own commitment to replace the constitution - an authoritarian holdover that she compares to a house that no longer fits the national family &apos;s needs - will now compete with other urgent priorities . 
After all , even if you need a new house , it makes no sense to demolish the old one just before a storm . 
In her first term , Bachelet adopted draconian but fiscally responsible policies , generating huge government surpluses that were earmarked for an ambitious pension reform and a rainy-day sovereign wealth fund . 
She implemented gradual and pragmatic reforms in education , pensions , health care , and competitiveness , but worked hard to build consensus and promote dialogue and popular participation . 
In her second term , Bachelet will have to weigh her promise of radical reforms with her past experience ( her only radical reform in her first term - a new public transportation system in the capital city of Santiago - backfired badly ) . 
In her victory speech , she reiterated some common campaign themes , including the new constitution , improvements to the education system , and gender parity in her administration . 
Some critics have warned that a hard left turn awaits Chile under Bachelet . 
Chile will remain further to the right than most Latin American countries and , indeed , than most OECD members - the group of countries with which Chile has grown accustomed to comparing itself . 
Chile also remains one of Latin America &apos;s least egalitarian countries . 
In recent years , social movements have demanded that the state play a stronger role in redistribution , and Bachelet &apos;s mandate will be to reduce inequality . 
If she accomplishes this through moderate and gradual reforms , Chile &apos;s democracy will grow stronger and more inclusive . 
If , however , she signals a preference for an alternative path , democratic institutions , public opinion , and economic pressure will remind her that Chileans do not favor changing the approach that has made their country the envy of Latin America .
