The Real Che Guevara 
PARIS - Hollywood history is often nonsensical , but filmmakers usually have the good sense not to whitewash killers and sadists . 
Steven Soderbergh &apos;s new film about Che Guevara , however , does that , and more . 
Che the revolutionary romantic , as depicted by Benecio del Toro in Soderbergh &apos;s film , never existed . That hero of the left , with his hippie hair and beard , an image now iconic on t-shirts and coffee mugs around the world , is a myth concocted by Fidel Castro &apos;s propagandists - something of a cross between Don Quixote and Robin Hood . 
Like those tall tales , Fidel &apos;s myth of Che bears a superficial resemblance to historical facts , but the real story is far darker . 
Some Robin Hood probably did brutalize the rich and , to cover his tracks , gave some of his loot to the poor . 
In medieval Spain , Quixote-like knights probably did roam the countryside , ridding it not of dragons but of the land &apos;s few remaining Muslims . 
The same goes for the legendary Che . 
No teenager in rebellion against the world or his parents seems able to resist Che &apos;s alluring image . 
Just wearing a Che t-shirt is the shortest and cheapest way to appear to be on the right side of History . 
What works for teenagers also seems to work with forever-young movie directors . 
In the 1960 &quot; s , the Che look , with beard and beret , was at least a glib political statement . 
Today , it is little more than a fashion accoutrement that inspires a big-budget Hollywood epic . 
Are Che theme parks next ? 
But once there was a real Che Guevara : he is less well known than the fictional puppet that has replaced reality . 
The true Che was a more significant figure than his fictional clone , for he was the incarnation of what revolution and Marxism really meant in the twentieth century . 
Che was no humanist . 
No communist leader , indeed , ever held humanist values . 
True to their movement &apos;s founding prophet , Stalin , Mao , Castro , and Che held no respect for life . 
Blood needed to be shed if a better world was to be baptized . 
When criticized by one of his early companions for the death of millions during the Chinese revolution , Mao observed that countless Chinese die everyday , so what did it matter ? 
Likewise , Che could kill with a shrug . 
Trained as a medical doctor in Argentina , he chose not to save lives but to suppress them . 
After he seized power , Che put to death five hundred &quot; enemies &quot; of the revolution without trial , or even much discrimination . 
Castro , no humanist himself , did his best to neutralize Guevara by appointing him Minister for Industry . 
As could be expected , Che applied Soviet policies to the Cubans : agriculture was destroyed and ghost factories dotted the landscape . 
He did not care about Cuba &apos;s economy or its people : his purpose was to pursue revolution for its own sake , whatever it meant , like art for art &apos;s sake . 
Indeed , without his ideology , Che would have been nothing more than another serial killer . 
Ideological sloganeering allowed him to kill in larger numbers than any serial killer could imagine , and all in the name of justice . 
Five centuries ago , Che probably would have been one of those priest / soldiers exterminating Latin America &apos;s natives in the name of God . 
In the name of History , Che , too , saw murder as a necessary tool of a noble cause . 
But suppose we judge this Marxist hero by his own criteria : did he actually transform the world ? 
The answer is yes - but for the worse . 
The communist Cuba he helped to forge is an undisputed and unmitigated failure , much more impoverished and much less free than it was before its &quot; liberation . &quot; 
Despite the social reforms the left likes to trumpet about Cuba , its literacy rate was higher before Castro came to power , and racism against the black population was less pervasive . 
Indeed , Cuba &apos;s leaders today are far more likely to be white than they were in Batista &apos;s day . 
Beyond Cuba , the Che myth has inspired thousands of students and activists across Latin America to lose their lives in foolhardy guerrilla struggles . 
The left , inspired by the siren call of Che , chose armed struggle instead of elections . 
By doing so , it opened the way to military dictatorship . 
Latin America is not yet cured of these unintended consequences of Guevarism . 
Indeed , fifty years after Cuba &apos;s revolution , Latin America remains divided . 
Those nations that rejected Che &apos;s mythology and chose the path of democracy and the free market , such as Brazil , Peru , and Chile , are better off than they ever were : equality , freedom , and economic progress have advanced in unity . 
By contrast , those nations that remain nostalgic for the cause of Che , such as Venezuela , Ecuador , and Bolivia , are at this very moment poised on the brink of civil war . 
The real Che , who spent most of his time as Castro &apos;s central banker supervising executions , deserves to be better known . 
Perhaps if Soderbergh &apos;s two-part Che epic succeeds at the box office , his financial backers will want to film a more truthful sequel . 
There is certainly no shortage of material for &quot; Che , The Untold Story . &quot;
