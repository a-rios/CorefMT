The Treason of the Economists 
LONDON - All epoch-defining events are the result of conjunctures - the correlation of normally unconnected events that jolt humanity out of a rut . 
Such conjunctures create what the author Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls &quot; Black Swans &quot; - unpredictable events with a vast impact . 
A small number of Black Swans , Taleb believes , &quot; explain almost everything in our world . &quot; 
The prosperity of the first age of globalization before 1914 , for example , resulted from a successful constellation of developments : falling transport and communication costs , the technological breakthroughs of the second industrial revolution , the pacific state of international relations , and Great Britain &apos;s successful management of the gold standard . 
By contrast , in the interwar years poisonous international politics combined with global economic imbalances to create the Great Depression and set the scene for World War II . 
Now consider recent financial innovations . 
On the back of the new computer and telecommunications technology , a giant market for derivative instruments was built . 
Collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs , mainly tied to mortgages ) made a new population of aspiring homeowners supposedly creditworthy by enabling the originating banks to sell &quot; sub-prime &quot; debt to other investors . 
Before securitization , banks typically held mortgages ; now they could get them off their books . 
But securitized credit taken off one bank &apos;s balance sheet usually ended up on another bank &apos;s books . 
What resulted was a wonderful system for diversifying individual bank risk , but only by magnifying the default risk of all banks that held what came to be called &quot; toxic &quot; debt . 
Because all the derivatives were based on the same assets , if anything happened to those assets , all the banks holding the debt would find themselves in the same soup . 
What made the spread of derivatives possible was the ease with which the volume of debt for a given set of real assets could be expanded . 
This scalability was magnified by the use of credit default swaps ( CDSs ) , which offered phony insurance against default . 
Since an unlimited number of CDSs could be sold against each borrower , the supply of swaps could grow much faster than the supply of bonds . 
CDSs magnified the size of the bubble by hugely speeding up the velocity of monetary circulation . 
The CDO market grew from $ 275 billion to $ 4.7 trillion from 2000 to 2006 , whereas the CDS market grew four times faster , from $ 920 billion in 2001 to $ 62 trillion by the end of 2007 . 
CDSs were the means by which derivatives found their way into the portfolios of banks all over the world . 
But the dependence of the whole structure on continually rising house prices was rarely made explicit . 
If the housing market started to fail , these paper assurances of safety would become , in Warren Buffett &apos;s words , &quot; financial weapons of mass destruction . &quot; 
But financial intermediation would never have brought disaster ( or indeed gone so far ) save for the global imbalances arising from America &apos;s twin trade and budget deficits , financed to a large extent by Chinese savings . 
Floating exchange rates were supposed to prevent countries from manipulating their currencies , but , by accumulating large quantities of US treasury bills , East Asian countries , especially China , kept their exchange rates artificially low . 
This East Asian &quot; savings glut &quot; enabled a debt-fuelled consumption glut in the US , Britain , and much of the Western world . 
But the marriage between Chinese savings and American consumption had a fatal flaw : it created non-repayable debts . 
Chinese investments increasingly took the form of official purchases of US Treasury bills . 
These investments did not create new resources to provide the means of repayment . 
For the counterpart of the US debt build-up was the relocation of much American manufacturing capacity to China . 
Chinese savings flowed not into creating new assets , but into financial speculation and consumer binges . 
&quot; Surplus &quot; Chinese savings made possible America &apos;s credit expansion between 2003-2005 , when the federal funds rate ( the overnight rate at which US banks lend to one another ) was held at 1 % . 
Ultra-cheap money produced a surge in sub-prime mortgage lending - a market that collapsed when interest rates increased steadily after 2005 , reaching 5 % .The financial crisis of 2008 was the start of a highly painful , but inevitable , process of de-leveraging . 
This interpretation of the origins of the present slump is disputed by the &quot; money glut &quot; school . 
In their view , there was one cause , and one cause only of the crisis : the excessive credit creation that took place when Alan Greenspan was chairman of the US Federal Reserve . 
This view draws on the &quot; Austrian &quot; theory of booms and slumps , and also Milton Friedman &apos;s explanation of the Great Depression of 1929 . 
It was wrong then , and it is wrong now . 
This line of reasoning assumes that markets are perfectly efficient . If they go wrong , it must be because of mistakes in policy . 
This view is also self-contradictory , for if market participants are perfectly rational and perfectly informed , they would not have been fooled by a policy of making money cheaper than it really was . 
Greenspan is the sacrifice they offer to the god of the market . 
This suggests a more fundamental reason for the economic crisis : the dominance of the Chicago school of economics , with its belief in the self-regulating properties of unfettered markets . 
This belief justified , or rationalized , the de-regulation of financial markets in the name of the so called &quot; efficient-market hypothesis . &quot; 
It led directly to the spread of financial risk-management models , which , by excluding the possibility of default , grossly underestimated the amount of risk in the system . 
If we are going pursue the blame game , I blame economists more than bankers for the crisis . 
They established the system of ideas that bankers , politicians , and regulators applied . 
John Maynard Keynes wrote that &quot; practical men who believe themselves to be quite immune from intellectual influences are usually the slaves of some defunct economist . &quot; 
Most of today &apos;s crop of economists are not defunct , but continue to work in the ideological vicinity of Chicago . 
Their assumptions should be ruthlessly exposed , for they have come close to destroying our world .
