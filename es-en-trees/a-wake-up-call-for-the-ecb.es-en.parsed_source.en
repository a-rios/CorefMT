A Wake-Up Call for the ECB 
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has allowed global stock markets to railroad him into a whopping 75-basis-point cut in interest rates just one week before the regularly scheduled meeting of the Fed &apos;s decision-making Open Market Committee . 
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet would never allow this to happen to the ECB - he manipulates markets ; markets don &apos;t manipulate him . 
Indeed , with America &apos;s economy in apparent freefall , Trichet is threatening euro-zone trade unions with pre-emptive interest-rate hikes unless they behave as he sees fit . 
These threats may be proving counter-productive to the achievement of price stability in the euro-zone economy , the central bank &apos;s primary objective . 
For example , to make his threats of an interest-rate hike in the midst of a global slowdown credible , the ECB president is using his press conferences to tell the world how strong European growth is . 
Besides being at odds with reality , the claim of strong growth actually encourages the trade unions to ask for even higher wages . 
And why shouldn &apos;t they if things are as good as Trichet claims ? 
Trichet also makes his job more difficult for himself by talking up Europe &apos;s inflationary threat . 
His colleague on the ECB Governing Council , Bundesbank president Axel Weber , seems to have gotten the message that the more ECB officials talk up inflationary fears , the more the trade unions will ask . 
So he recently toned down his rhetoric by warning that euro-zone inflationary pressures should not be &quot; over-dramatized . &quot; 
How true ! 
The essential economic reality confronting the ECB today is that the American economy is falling headlong into a serious slump - Bernanke &apos;s surprise cut speaks volumes to this . 
It defies economic logic to think that the global economy - including Europe - will escape its consequences . 
As European growth slows , so will inflationary pressures . 
So Trichet should relax , stop threatening others , and let the economic slowdown do the work for him . 
Even with sticky wages and prices in Europe , the global slowdown will reduce energy , commodity , and food prices on world markets , all of which are important factors behind currently elevated European inflation levels . 
The crude oil price already has dropped substantially from its highs at the beginning of the year . 
But the evolving slowdown is not the only reason the threat of a wage-price spiral in Europe is overblown . 
Germany is facing a key wage negotiation with public-sector unions . 
Even if the unions win large wage increases - which is very likely and entirely justifiable given their past restraint - this will have only a negligible effect on Europe &apos;s price stability . 
Increased public-sector wage costs mean increased government spending on wages . 
If this is financed by cutbacks elsewhere in the budget , the main consequence will be only a re-distribution of government spending , which is not necessarily inflationary . 
Nor is it inflationary if the wage increases are financed by higher taxes . 
Only if the budget surplus diminishes would there be an inflationary impact , and that would not be due to a wage-price spiral , but to an increase in net government demand , which actually might not be a bad thing for an economy facing a potentially severe economic slowdown . 
In the United States , it should be remembered , the need for a fiscal stimulus developed , so it seems , out of the blue . 
The same may happen in Europe , especially given the ECB &apos;s refusal to cut interest rates . 
A decent settlement with public-sector workers could give Germany a &quot; backdoor &quot; fiscal stimulus just at the right moment - when aggregate demand is flagging . 
The real problem with a generous wage settlement with public-sector unions is that private-sector unions could use it to get more than their productivity gains warrant . 
Contracts with the metal and chemical workers also are coming up for negotiation this year in Germany , and union leaders are talking tough . 
Berthold Huber , the head of Germany &apos;s huge IG Metall engineering union , recently promised his rank and file &quot; a mega year &quot; for pay increases . 
But the global slowdown , which takes the fangs out of the strike threat , will keep private-sector workers in line no matter how much their leaders may rant and rave . 
Everyone , including bellicose trade unionists , tends to become more reasonable when the economy turns south . 
Rather than encourage the unions with exaggerated talk of strong European growth and inflationary excess - and disrespect them with threats and interventions - Trichet should speak softly and let nature take its course .
