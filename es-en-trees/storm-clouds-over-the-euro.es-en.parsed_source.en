Storm Clouds over the Euro 
The creation of the European Monetary Union ( EMU ) was an unprecedented achievement , promising deeper and larger markets . 
The stimulus to trade and investment is manifest . 
But will the Euro last ? 
Two current developments will shape the answer . 
The first is the outcome of battles raging in France , Germany , and elsewhere over social security reform . 
The second is the debate over the inclusion of &quot; social rights &quot; in the EU &apos;s draft Constitution . 
Welfare state entitlements are vastly different from country to country in Europe . 
These differences portend intense conflicts within EMU . 
France , Germany , and Italy must scale back their social commitments , raise taxes , or borrow . 
But in the Eurozone &apos;s increasingly competitive environment , raising taxes would drive away business , while cutting benefits may be tantamount to political suicide . 
So the temptation to borrow is high . 
The Stability and Growth Pact is designed to block that temptation by keeping budget deficits below 3 % of GDP . 
But the Pact is already straining , and today &apos;s serial violations may appear mild when the baby boom generation begins to retire and public pension and health liabilities become cash demands . 
Some national deficits may rise to twice the Pact &apos;s limit . 
If that happens , the affected countries can expect no help from the European Central Bank , which is prohibited from bailing out member states . 
Italy and Belgium , heavily indebted when the Euro was launched , could become the classic victims of a vicious circle , in which high deficits trigger rising interest rates , higher borrowing costs , even higher deficits , and eventually default . 
If an EMU country defaults , it will come under intense pressure to leave the Euro in order to regain control of its currency and pay at least its domestic liabilities in devalued national paper . 
If that country is large , the shock waves could push other members over the edge with it . 
Recent events in Argentina provide a warning as to how such a crisis can unfold . 
Ballooning provincial deficits , which Argentina &apos;s central government could not control - but was obliged to finance - pushed the country into default , forcing it to abandon a monetary pact ( the currency &apos;s one-to-one peg to the dollar ) to which the population was attached . 
The Euro faces a second basic challenge . 
The governments that launched EMU anticipated that their workers and businesses would eventually be sufficiently mobile and flexible to adjust to economic changes affecting them differentially . 
At present , workers throughout the EU resist moving to change jobs , and social regulations hamper the mobility and adaptability of businesses . 
Legislatures are under pressure to relax these constraints . 
But little noticed social provisions in the EU draft Constitution , which Europe &apos;s leaders are expected to sign in less than a year , could compromise the liberalizing process . 
In Part II of the draft Constitution , a list of &quot; social rights &quot; is incorporated as &quot; constitutional rights , &quot; enforced by the European Court of Justice . 
These include protection against &quot; unjustified dismissal , &quot; the right to &quot; working conditions that respect the worker &apos;s health , safety and dignity , &quot; and &quot; entitlement to social security benefits &#91; apparently regardless of cost &#93; ... in cases such as illness , old age , and loss of employment . &quot; 
Faced with these new statutes , the Court might well change its basic approach . 
Since its inception , the Court &apos;s thrust has been to enforce the economic freedoms mandated by successive agreements since the Treaty of Rome . 
A Bill of Social Rights will require the Court to balance this liberalizing mission with attention to the new protections . 
In this new legal environment , national efforts to dismantle business restrictions could grind to a halt . 
The consequences for the Euro would be grave . 
Without further liberalization , EMU will remain subject to potentially fatal strains arising from shocks that affect some countries more than others . 
Imagine that the economic boom that Greece is experiencing in the run-up to the 2004 Olympics turns to bust after the games end . 
Because the drachma does not exist anymore , it cannot be devalued . 
If the ECB considers a large reduction of interest rates , contrary to its inflation objectives , the bank won &apos;t be able to help by cutting interest rates to benefit Greece . 
So the appropriate response for Greece would be an energetic restructuring program , involving closing some businesses , requiring changes in working conditions , and perhaps even cutting wages . 
But if regulations block Greek firms from laying off workers , and if militant Greek unions refuse any changes in working conditions , the result could be a wave of bankruptcies and a surge in unemployment . 
The Greek government , already burdened by social security obligations , would have to increase unemployment payments , at a time when its revenues would be collapsing . 
Radical proposals to leave the Euro , and restart the Greek economy with a program of devaluation and budgetary expansion , could become compelling . 
In truth , many of the rigidities underlying this hypothetical crisis are not attributable to provisions in the draft Constitution . 
Greece has not liberalized sufficiently to insure its economy against idiosyncratic shocks , despite impressive reforms to date . 
A new Bill of Social Rights would not create destructive rigidities , but it could slow down the liberalizing process that countries like Greece need to withstand the vicissitudes of a common currency . 
A Euro crisis can be avoided . 
But to do so the nations of Europe must lift the twin clouds of pension debt and regulatory protections . 
France and Germany are pursuing modest but nonetheless courageous reforms . 
If their liberalizing efforts , and those of others , are not to stall , their leaders should see to it that the draft Bill of Social Rights is not frozen in its present form in the EU Constitution . 
Instead , these rights should be left in the hands of national legislatures , which have the flexibility to change their minds .
