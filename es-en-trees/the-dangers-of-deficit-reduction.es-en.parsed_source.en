The Dangers of Deficit Reduction 
NEW YORK - A wave of fiscal austerity is rushing over Europe and America . 
The magnitude of budget deficits - like the magnitude of the downturn - has taken many by surprise . 
But despite protests by the yesterday &apos;s proponents of deregulation , who would like the government to remain passive , most economists believe that government spending has made a difference , helping to avert another Great Depression . 
Most economists also agree that it is a mistake to look at only one side of a balance sheet ( whether for the public or private sector ) . 
One has to look not only at what a country or firm owes , but also at its assets . 
This should help answer those financial sector hawks who are raising alarms about government spending . 
After all , even deficit hawks acknowledge that we should be focusing not on today &apos;s deficit , but on the long-term national debt . 
Spending , especially on investments in education , technology , and infrastructure , can actually lead to lower long-term deficits . 
Banks &quot; short-sightedness helped create the crisis ; we cannot let government short-sightedness - prodded by the financial sector - prolong it . 
Faster growth and returns on public investment yield higher tax revenues , and a 5 to 6 % return is more than enough to offset temporary increases in the national debt . 
A social cost-benefit analysis ( taking into account impacts other than on the budget ) makes such expenditures , even when debt-financed , even more attractive . 
Finally , most economists agree that , apart from these considerations , the appropriate size of a deficit depends in part on the state of the economy . 
A weaker economy calls for a larger deficit , and the appropriate size of the deficit in the face of a recession depends on the precise circumstances . 
It is here that economists disagree . 
Forecasting is always difficult , but especially so in troubled times . 
What has happened is ( fortunately ) not an everyday occurrence ; it would be foolish to look at past recoveries to predict this one . 
In America , for instance , bad debt and foreclosures are at levels not seen for three-quarters of a century ; the decline in credit in 2009 was the largest since 1942 . 
Comparisons to the Great Depression are also deceptive , because the economy today is so different in so many ways . 
And nearly all so-called experts have proven highly fallible - witness the United States Federal Reserve &apos;s dismal forecasting record before the crisis . 
Yet , even with large deficits , economic growth in the US and Europe is anemic , and forecasts of private-sector growth suggest that in the absence of continued government support , there is risk of continued stagnation - of growth too weak to return unemployment to normal levels anytime soon . 
The risks are asymmetric : if these forecasts are wrong , and there is a more robust recovery , then , of course , expenditures can be cut back and / or taxes increased . 
But if these forecasts are right , then a premature &quot; exit &quot; from deficit spending risks pushing the economy back into recession . 
This is one of the lessons we should have learned from America &apos;s experience in the Great Depression ; it is also one of the lessons to emerge from Japan &apos;s experience in the late 1990 &quot; s . 
These points are particularly germane for the hardest-hit economies . 
The United Kingdom , for example , has had a harder time than other countries for an obvious reason : it had a real-estate bubble ( though of less consequence than in Spain ) , and finance , which was at the epicenter of the crisis , played a more important role in its economy than it does in other countries . 
The UK &apos;s weaker performance is not the result of worse policies ; indeed , compared to the US , its bank bailouts and labor-market policies were , in many ways , far better . 
It avoided the massive waste of human resources associated with high unemployment in America , where almost one out of five people who would like a full-time job cannot find one . 
As the global economy returns to growth , governments should , of course , have plans on the drawing board to raise taxes and cut expenditures . 
The right balance will inevitably be a subject of dispute . 
Principles like &quot; it is better to tax bad things than good things &quot; might suggest imposing environmental taxes . 
The financial sector has imposed huge externalities on the rest of society . 
America &apos;s financial industry polluted the world with toxic mortgages , and , in line with the well established &quot; polluter pays &quot; principle , taxes should be imposed on it . 
Besides , well-designed taxes on the financial sector might help alleviate problems caused by excessive leverage and banks that are too big to fail . 
Taxes on speculative activity might encourage banks to focus greater attention on performing their key societal role of providing credit . 
Over the longer term , most economists agree that governments , especially in advanced industrial countries with aging populations , should be concerned about the sustainability of their policies . 
But we must be wary of deficit fetishism . 
Deficits to finance wars or give-aways to the financial sector ( as happened on a massive scale in the US ) lead to liabilities without corresponding assets , imposing a burden on future generations . 
But high-return public investments that more than pay for themselves can actually improve the well-being of future generations , and it would be doubly foolish to burden them with debts from unproductive spending and then cut back on productive investments . 
These are questions for a later day - at least in many countries , prospects of a robust recovery are , at best , a year or two away . 
For now , the economics is clear : reducing government spending is a risk not worth taking .
