The Crisis of the Left 
After a series of electoral losses around the world , the left is in crisis . 
To restore it to health , some on the left argue for a return to their parties &apos; historical roots . 
Others argue that the old myths should be abandoned in favor of a bold move forward . 
This debate is occurring not only in France after the defeat of the Socialists last April . 
It also characterizes the political situation in the US after the defeat of the Democrats in last November &apos;s mid-term elections . 
Both parties face the same dilemma , and this is precisely my point : that the crisis confronting the left is a deep , fundamental , one . 
In the past , the left was equipped with its own ideology , its own economic theory . 
The fundamental economic mechanism that determined how the world worked was the struggle for rents between workers and capitalists . 
With this &quot; us versus them &quot; view of the world , it was not hard to rally voters , from the most disenfranchised all the way up to the salaried middle class - more than enough for the left to secure electoral majorities . 
But the world has changed , and the left &apos;s old view simply no longer applies . 
More intense competition , within and across countries , has decreased the available rents . 
Financial capital can cross borders far more easily , and physical capital can relocate almost as quickly . 
The limits on redistribution through the market are much tighter : trying to appropriate the rents may lead firms to move to emerging countries , or else to go bankrupt . 
This reality has taken a while to sink in , and a number of parties on the left still cannot bring themselves to acknowledge the constraints imposed by market forces . 
Some do , of course , none more explicitly than the UK &apos;s Labor Party , led by Tony Blair . 
Others , typically old-line communist parties , have retained much of their traditional rhetoric , but this is largely for electoral consumption . 
They know all too well that the old nemesis , &quot; capital , &quot; has become difficult or impossible to expropriate , yet they remain unready or unwilling to deliver the news to their constituency . 
The same tension exists within parties themselves . 
Witness the muddled debate within the French Socialist party in the aftermath of its defeat , with the &quot; left of the left &quot; and the &quot; right of the left &quot; in a fight for control both of the party and the route by which it should eventually return to power . 
And yet both available strategies - doing nothing or attempting to modernize - have obvious pitfalls . 
The old rhetoric , after all , still resonates powerfully with the most destitute parts of the electorate : minimum wage workers , the long-term unemployed , and all those who feel that anything would be better than what they have now . 
It also allows easier contact with fringe groups , such as anti-globalization protesters and the most zealous greens . 
But while the old religion still mobilizes the left , it makes it difficult to hold the center . 
The middle class has lost its faith in the old rhetoric , and wherever the left , by some chance , comes to power , reality quickly sinks in . 
Modernization runs into the opposite problems . 
Public discussion of new ways to finance retirement pension plans , or of introducing a negative income tax , sounds sweet to economists of all stripes , but it does not exactly mobilize public opinion . 
The poor don &apos;t care . 
The extreme left becomes disenfranchised . 
The middle class likes the tone , but wonders how different the program is from what they hear from the neo-liberal right . 
As the events of the French elections last spring demonstrated , when this dynamic prevails , the left loses the elections . 
Shift everything I just said regarding this strategic dilemma to the right a bit and you arrive at the problems of America &apos;s Democrats . 
The choice of a candidate for the next elections is about this strategic choice , not personalities . 
Shift everything a bit to the left , and you arrive at the problems facing President Lula Ignacio da Silva in Brazil . 
Should he return to the old Lula rhetoric and watch capital flee the country , or try &quot; modernity &quot; and disappoint many of those who voted for him ? 
With minor adjustments , the left in Germany , Italy , Spain , Portugal , and so on faces the same Hobson &apos;s choice . 
So : Damned if you do ; damned if you don &apos;t ? 
No , or at least not quite . 
The fundamental feature that must distinguish the left and the right is not their respective views on the economy , but rather their stances regarding redistribution . 
One of the first lessons of economics is that there is a trade-off between efficiency and redistribution . 
The right focuses on efficiency . 
The left emphasizes redistribution . 
A clear commitment to the poor , the sick , and the unfortunate must be the message of the left . 
And the means , however &quot; boring . &quot; must be appropriate to realizing this commitment : a combination of sustainable retirement systems , better designed unemployment benefit systems , negative income taxes , training programs , and the like . 
Only by employing the rhetoric of commitment to mobilize the troops while devoting careful attention to the center &apos;s concern with methods can the left hope to return to power .
