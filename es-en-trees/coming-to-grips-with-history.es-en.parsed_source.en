Coming to Grips with History 
May 9th will be the mother of all celebrations in Moscow . 
The victory over Nazi-Germany 60 years ago will be commemorated and the human sacrifices to this end honoured . 
So far , so good . 
But some nations will be missing from the party . 
Two Baltic presidents have decided to stay home , because their hosts are not willing to concede that there is more to the history of WWII &apos;s end than the victory over Hitler . 
Their peoples had to face half a century of occupation because of a deal struck before the war &apos;s onset by Hitler and Stalin , the so-called Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 that divided Eastern Europe between Nazi-Germany and the Soviet Union . 
I have to admire the third Baltic president - Vaira Vike-Freiberga from Latvia - who decided to go to Moscow , honouring what should be honoured , and speaking aloud about what should not be hidden . 
By doing so she demonstrates the strong position her country has obtained as a member of NATO and the EU , and she will be the one riding the high moral ground . 
It is a pity that the Russian leadership of today has chosen not to condemn the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact that damaged the development of the whole Baltic Sea region for so many years - and still is a source of political pollution threatening to poison relations between neighbors around the Baltic Sea . 
I find it difficult to accept those who tend to describe the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact as only a measure to build up Soviet national security . 
In the Baltic Sea Region we have a particularly difficult history to deal with , if we look at the last 90 years . 
After the end of WWI and the old order - &quot; Die Welt von Gestern &quot; - the Baltic region saw bloody revolutions , terrible civil wars , fascism , communism , genocide , occupations , oppression , terrorism , deportations - you name it , in our part of the world we have indeed had our share of all the horrors of the modern history . 
When the Cold War ended , it seemed clever to say that this was &quot; the end of History . &quot; 
But if we believe that - if we put a lid on history and leave it behind us - we run a risk that history will resurrect itself with all its horrors . 
Therefore we must come to terms with history , particularly in the Baltic Sea region , where such a reckoning is a fundamental precondition for building mutual confidence and cooperation . 
If you want to open &quot; new chapters &quot; in relations between old adversaries , you cannot simply close &quot; old chapters &quot; by denying or suppressing history . 
Nothing good comes out of doing so - and we have seen enough of that in the past . 
For too many years the Baltic Sea was a blind alley on the political map of Europe - divided by the Iron Curtain . 
It was not a &quot; Sea of Peace &quot; - as the communist propaganda tried to describe it - it was a Sea of Threats , a sea of insecurity and lost opportunities . 
To my country - Denmark - WWII &apos;s end meant a return to freedom and democracy , and we could use the rest of the 20th century to strengthen our freedom , bolstering it with affluence . 
But to the three Baltic countries the end of WWII led to half a century of occupation and lost opportunities . 
We know to day the cause : the secret protocol to the Treaty of Non-aggression between the Soviet Union and Nazi-Germany , signed in 1939 - the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact - defining the spheres of interest of the two dictatorships in eastern Europe which led to the war with Finland , the occupations of the Baltic countries , the assault on and division of Poland , and probably also the occupations of Norway and Denmark . 
In short , this pact with its excrescence had an enormous impact on the history of our region , right up to this day . 
That it why it will continue to haunt us , continue to disturb normal relations between the countries in this region with so much unused potential , as long as we do not deal with it in a forthright manner . 
Debating , recognizing , denouncing - whatever .... anything but suppressing ! 
You cannot build lasting future relations between countries that have each in their own way suffered so much , without coming to terms with the past . 
It was not until 1989 that the existence of this protocol was officially admitted , thanks to the Glasnost-policy of Mikhail Gorbachev . 
But too many people still have difficulties with acknowledging this pact for what it really was . 
Such denial is in no one &apos;s interest . 
Not in the kind of Europe we still have to build - a Europe where big and small countries are assured that they share the same rights and obligations , where minorities feel safe , where basic human rights are accepted as an inextricable part of our political system , and where neighbors are regarded with respect and expectations , not fear and anxiety . 
But it is no surprise that coming to terms with history can be damnably difficult . 
The Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard put his finger on one of the more fundamental problems : &quot; Life must be lived forwards - but can only be understood backwards . &quot; 
In order to look forward with confidence , you also have to look back - and understand what went wrong . 
Every leader in Moscow May 9th should remember this .
