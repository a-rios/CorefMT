Misusing the Inaction Argument 
SAN JOSÉ , COSTA RICA - One commonly repeated argument for doing something about climate change sounds compelling , but turns out to be almost fraudulent . 
It is based on comparing the cost of action with the cost of inaction , and almost every major politician in the world uses it . 
The president of the European Commission , José Manuel Barroso , for example , used this argument when he presented the European Union &apos;s proposal to tackle climate change earlier this year . 
The EU promised to cut its CO2 emissions by 20 % by 2020 , at a cost that the Commission &apos;s own estimates put at about 0.5 % of GDP , or roughly € 60 billion per year . 
This is obviously a hefty price tag - at least a 50 % increase in the total cost of the EU - and it will likely be much higher ( the Commission has previously estimated the cost to be double its current estimate ) . 
But Barroso &apos;s punchline was that &quot; the cost is low compared to the high price of inaction . &quot; 
In fact , he forecasted that the price of doing nothing &quot; could even approach 20 % of GDP . &quot; 
( Never mind that this cost estimate is probably wildly overestimated - most models show about 3 % damages . ) 
So there you have it . 
Of course , politicians should be willing to spend 0.5 % of GDP to avoid a 20 % cost of GDP . 
This sounds eminently sensible - until you realize that Barroso is comparing two entirely different issues . 
The 0.5 % -of-GDP expense will reduce emissions ever so slightly ( if everyone in the EU actually fulfills their requirements for the rest of the century , global emissions will fall by about 4 % ) . 
This would reduce the temperature increase expected by the end of the century by just five-hundredths of a degree Celsius ( nine-hundredths Fahrenheit ) . 
Thus , the EU &apos;s immensely ambitious program will not stop or even significantly impact global warming . 
In other words , if Barroso fears costs of 20 % of GDP in the year 2100 , the 0.5 % payment every year of this century will do virtually nothing to change that cost . 
We would still have to pay by the end of the century , only now we would also have made ourselves poorer in the 90 years preceding it . 
The sleight of hand works because we assume that the action will cancel all the effects of inaction , whereas of course , nothing like that is true . 
This becomes much clearer if we substitute much smaller action than Barroso envisions . 
For example , say that the EU decides to put up a diamond-studded wind turbine at the Berlaymont headquarters , which will save one ton of CO2 each year . 
The cost will be $ 1 billion , but the EU says that this is incredibly cheap when compared to the cost of inaction on climate change , which will run into the trillions . 
It should be obvious that the $ 1 billion windmill doesn &apos;t negate the trillions of dollars of damage from climate change that we still have to pay by the end of the century . 
The EU &apos;s argument is similar to advising a man with a gangrenous leg that paying $ 50,000 for an aspirin is a good deal because the cost compares favorably to the cost of inaction , which is losing the leg . 
Of course , the aspirin doesn &apos;t prevent that outcome . 
The inaction argument is really terribly negligent , because it causes us to recommend aspirin and lose sight of smarter actions that might actually save the leg . 
Likewise , it is negligent to focus on inefficiently cutting CO2 now because of costs in the distant future that in reality will not be avoided . 
It stops us from focusing on long-term strategies like investment in energy R D that would actually solve climate change and at a much lower cost . 
If Barroso were alone , perhaps we could let his statement go , but the same argument is used again and again by influential politicians . 
Germany &apos;s Angela Merkel says it &quot; makes economic sense &quot; to cut CO2 , because the &quot; the economic consequences of inaction will be dramatic for us all . &quot; 
Australia &apos;s Kevin Rudd agrees that &quot; the cost of inaction will be far greater than the cost of action . &quot; 
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has gone on record with the exact same words . 
In the United States , both John McCain and Barack Obama use the cost of inaction as a pivotal reason to support carbon cuts . 
California senator Diane Feinstein argues that we should curb carbon emissions because the Sierra snowpack , which accounts for much of California &apos;s drinking water , will be reduced by 40 % by 2050 due to global warming . 
What she fails to tell us is that even a substantial reduction in emissions - at a high cost - will have an immeasurable effect on snowmelt by 2050 . 
Instead , we should perhaps invest in water storage facilities . 
Likewise , when politicians fret that we will lose a significant proportion of polar bears by 2050 , they use it as an argument for cutting carbon , but forget to tell us that doing so will have no measurable effect on polar bear populations . 
Instead , we should perhaps stop shooting the 300 polar bears we hunt each year . 
The inaction argument makes us spend vast resources on policies that will do virtually nothing to deal with climate change , thereby diverting those resources from policies that could actually make an impact . 
We would never accept medical practitioners advising ultra-expensive and ineffective aspirins for gangrene because the cost of aspirin outweighs the cost of losing the leg . 
Why , then , should we tolerate such fallacious arguments when debating the costliest public policy decision in the history of mankind ?
