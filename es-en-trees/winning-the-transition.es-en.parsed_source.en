Winning the Transition 
WASHINGTON , DC - Is the Arab Spring turning into a gloomy autumn ? 
With brutal crackdowns in Syria , a bloody civil war in Libya , and Yemen teetering on the brink of chaos , the number of skeptics is growing . 
Although Egypt and Tunisia &apos;s pro-democracy movements achieved rapid regime change , uncertainties remain in those countries , too . 
After a brief period of hope , many observers now wonder whether the region is capable of producing viable , and economically vibrant , democracies . 
Revolutions and their aftermaths , of course , are always fluid and fickle times , and the outcome is often perched on a knife &apos;s edge . 
Bridging the vast gap between high expectations and the reality of limited budgets and capabilities is a test in itself . 
Redressing past injustice and building an economy that offers opportunity to all are major challenges as well , fraught with volatility , uncertainty , and the dangers of political opportunism . 
But transitions are also times of great opportunity . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , I was among those Indonesians who demanded and celebrated the departure of our own autocrat , Suharto , and I joined the new government when he left . 
Many observers predicted that Indonesia , the world &apos;s most populous Muslim country , would be unable to sustain democracy and would ultimately decline into chaos . 
The task ahead of us was daunting . 
But we proved the skeptics wrong , and learned some fundamental lessons . 
Perhaps most importantly , we learned that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for democratization . 
Each of the countries of the Middle East and North Africa will face unique challenges , which will have to be addressed on their own terms . 
Even so , they all must make a real and symbolic break with the past . 
The new authorities must send strong signals that the old ways are finished . 
Change must be formally manifested , with new laws that are widely publicized . 
Legislation that empowers citizens with freedom of expression , free and independent elections , and freedom of association is crucial , and it must be made clear to the public that no one is above the law . 
Anything less will undermine the transition . 
Moreover , corruption is the bane of development everywhere , so new governments should move fast to establish institutions and procedures to fight it . 
Transparency and accountability are powerful ideas with near-universal support , which means that new leaders should not give up when the fight becomes difficult . 
Civil-society organizations , local communities , representatives of the poor and vulnerable , and women play a vital role in this regard , and they should be included at every level of decision-making . 
In Indonesia , we signed a hundred laws in less than 18 months , covering everything from media freedom to elections , corruption , decentralization , and anti-trust rules . 
We ratified new public-finance legislation and ensured the independence of the country &apos;s central bank . 
New leaders must also expect and manage setbacks . 
In post-revolutionary times , expectations are high , and the obstacles to meeting them are enormous . 
I know from personal experience that we did not always have the luxury of getting the best outcomes . 
We had to compromise and settle for the best possible results . 
Security threats are among the most serious setbacks in transitions . 
Nationalistic sentiment is strong , and politicians and interest groups can exploit it . 
Often , the security forces are holdovers from the old regime , and there is no independent judicial system . 
Reforms will take time , and the old bureaucracies may not be able to implement them . 
In Indonesia , we used various innovations to work around such dilemmas . 
For example , we appointed an independent judge to take over the bankruptcy and corruption courts , because career judges were too tainted . 
Likewise , when we started cash-for-work programs as part of our pro-poor agenda , we asked communities to run these initiatives . 
More broadly , new leaders are well advised to ensure that the economy performs well . 
It is important to restore economic activity and create a favorable environment for entrepreneurs , particularly small and medium-size businesses , which constitute the main engine of job creation . 
The recent revolutions , it should be recalled , started with the self-immolation of a Tunisian fruit vendor , who was harassed and insulted by the authorities . 
But economic success without accountability and social inclusion is not sustainable , and new governments often must face tough choices in order to protect the poor and vulnerable . 
They might have to abolish mis-targeted subsidies to free up resources for more targeted and efficient anti-poverty and job-creation programs . 
In Indonesia , we had to draw a line between the very poor and the near-poor . 
We could not afford to raise salaries or provide subsidies for everybody . 
Our help had to be targeted . 
So , while we helped the neediest , we excluded others who were not poor enough to benefit . 
This was a tough and unpopular choice . 
Finally , countries in transition need support - not only money , but also technical know-how to implement highly complex reforms . 
When I became Indonesia &apos;s finance minister , I had 64,000 employees . 
But when we had to modernize our tax system , we could not find the required expertise anywhere in our country . 
Yes , we needed external assistance , but we never surrendered &quot; ownership &quot; of the reform process ; we made it work for us . 
If we Indonesians had not been in charge of our own transition , it could easily have failed . 
That lesson , too , is one that all countries in transition should bear in mind .
