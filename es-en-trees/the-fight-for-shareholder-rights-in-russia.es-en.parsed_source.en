The Fight for Shareholder Rights in Russia 
MOSCOW : Abuse of shareholders by managers and majority owners cripples foreign investment in Russia . 
No surprise , then , that improving corporate governance and protecting minority shareholders is becoming a concern of the Putin government . 
Refusing shareholders entry to shareholders meetings , or striking their names off share registers - two popular gimmicks of a few years ago - are rarer nowadays . 
Some &quot; oligarchs &quot; have undergone Damascene conversions and are trying to improve their image among investors . 
A few companies , such as the oil giant Yukos , even appoint independent directors from abroad . 
These private sector improvements , however , are nowhere to be seen among large businesses controlled by Government , even though many of these firms have a substantial minority of private shareholders who need protection from managerial abuse . 
Management in these firms , indeed , has become more arrogant and inventive in violating shareholder rights . 
As an independent member of the boards of electricity utility RAO UES and the gas giant Gazprom , I know directly of their waywardness . 
United Energy Systems ( UES ) is headed by Anatoly Chubais , a former deputy prime minister with a reputation as a reformer . 
At board meetings , tame in-house managers usually outvote me . 
If UES bosses want to buy a skyscraper despite UES &apos;s making a $ 350 million loss , it is fine with them . 
In November we were asked to approve - without review - huge overpayments on administration . 
Sometimes we hear that UES has acquired a TV station or finances a political faction in the Duma via a subsidiary . 
Extracting information on any of these matters is almost impossible . 
After 3 years as CEO , Chubais decided to &quot; restructure &quot; UES , thinking that glib talk about competition and liberalization will garner him continued support from London and New York . 
He tried to brow-beat investors at a board meeting in the Kremlin where - in good Soviet tradition - everyone was expected to vote unanimously to split the company into small pieces so as to sell them at low prices to cronies , political allies , and friendly oligarchs . 
When shareholders balked , Chubais sought to neutralize his opponents , unilaterally changing the agreement with the Bank of New York to control the votes of most holders of American Depository Rights ( ADRs ) . 
Disgusted , many UES shareholders sold their shares . 
Others are fighting on - calling an extraordinary shareholders meeting , complaining to Government , possibly suing . 
What do investors want ? 
To solve the issue of government set electricity rates , to stop theft and mismanagement , to put the company &apos;s house in order before any &quot; restructuring . &quot; 
No investor believes that current management will sell UES assets at fair prices . 
Similar misdeeds , with added twists , exist in the energy giant Gazprom , where old-style Soviet managers misrule . 
The issue , again , is shareholder value , with shareholders worrying that billions of dollars are disappearing from the company . 
These suspicions are bolstered by the fact that Gazprom &apos;s shares have underperformed the market for years and the fact that the company does not pay proper dividends . 
Shareholders know of hundreds of agricultural enterprises , hotels , luxury villas , banks , investment companies and corporate jets owned by Gazprom . 
These have little to do with Gazprom &apos;s main business , are loss-making and are probably used to channel company money to managers . 
Indeed , subsidiaries where managers hold shares through their children and other relatives - say , the huge construction company Stroitransgaz which has billion-dollar contracts with Gazprom - are created regularly and shareholders seem powerless to stop such practices . 
Shareholders also hear of Gazprom providing financial guarantees to parties which - officially at least - have nothing to do with its business . 
One example is the Media / Most group which , for reasons unknown , was financed by Gazprom to the tune of more than half a billion dollars ! 
It is even said in Moscow that a reason behind the recent arrest of Media / Most &apos;s owner , Vladimir Gusinsky , in Spain on an Interpol warrant is the desire by Moscow prosecutors to discover everything Gusinsky knows about Gazprom &apos;s inner workings . 
But secret deals with Media / Most are but the tip of the iceberg . 
Creating boundless suspicions are Gazprom &apos;s links to the Florida-based company ITERA , which grew into a multibillion enterprise on par with Gazprom in only a few years . 
Investors suspect such phenomenal growth was achieved at Gazprom &apos;s expense . 
In Ukraine , for example , billions of dollars of Russian gas supplies go unpaid every year . 
Russia &apos;s Government talks with Ukraine &apos;s government . 
To no avail . 
Suddenly , we discover that one-third of Ukraine &apos;s gas supplies are controlled by ITERA , and wonder why this is so and where the money is going . 
Because the Government has not sufficiently liberalized domestic gas prices , manipulation is easy . 
Gazprom &apos;s sales in Russia are often disguised as murky barter deals . 
Despite this , Gazprom &apos;s holding company appears to be rolling in cash while its production subsidiaries mostly appear bankrupt and never pay their taxes in full . 
As a minister I once put pressure on Gazprom over taxes and was summoned to parliament by indignant deputies . 
Many Duma members and local governors owe their jobs to Gazprom . 
Managers of Government-controlled companies like Gazprom and UES live in a style befitting oligarchs , create nest eggs for themselves , and play around in politics . 
Why are clear suspicions of corruption , asset-stripping and outright theft not investigated and punished , even though both companies are majority-owned by the Government and most of the board membership is state appointed ? 
Putin &apos;s inaction looks like weakness , and these scandals discourage foreign investment . 
President Putin &apos;s silence here is surprising . 
To make progress in corporate governance at state-controlled companies Putin does not need new laws or IMF loans . 
He should pick up the phone and fire managers who compromise Russia . 
This would be the clearest sign of his intention to put reform on the right track . 
Private investors - indeed , all Russia &apos;s citizens - are watching and waiting .
