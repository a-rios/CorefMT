What &apos;s Wrong with Ethnic Profiling ? 
BRUSSELS - Several years ago , as terrorism , immigration , and unrest in suburban Paris were at the top of the news in France , a French police officer confided to a researcher : &quot; If you consider different levels of trafficking , it is obviously done by blacks and Arabs . 
If you are on the road and see a black man or a man with Arabic features , you say to yourself , &quot; He doesn &apos;t look French , &quot; and then you might stop him to see if he has papers . &quot; 
This police officer was describing a textbook example of &quot; ethnic profiling &quot; : law enforcement officials use of stereotypes , rather than specific information about behavior , in deciding to stop , search , or detain people . 
Ethnic profiling is illegal in Europe . 
It is ineffective in apprehending criminals . 
It is counter-productive in the campaign against terrorism . 
But police officers across Europe continue to use it . 
The inefficiency of ethnic profiling was highlighted in early May , when the British government released figures showing that , of the more than 117,000 police stops made between 2007 and 2008 , only 72 led to an arrest for terrorism-related offences . 
Other major European countries do not collect data on police stops broken down according to the targets &quot; ethnic or religious background . 
But private research and anecdotal reports provide a frighteningly similar picture . 
A massive data-mining exercise in Germany from 2001 to 2003 trawled through personal information on 8.3 million people and failed to find a single terrorist . 
Stops and searches conducted under counter-terrorism powers in Europe have produced few terrorism charges and no convictions . 
Separate studies in Britain , the Netherlands , Sweden , and the United States have concluded that ethnic profiling wastes time and resources . 
As a new report by the Open Society Justice Initiative shows , by targeting ethnic minorities , police alienate some of the very people on whom they depend for cooperation and intelligence . 
And by pre-selecting fixed categories of people for heightened scrutiny , the authorities overlook those who do not fit the profile . 
A young Spanish man who is a member of an ethnic minority group put it this way : &quot; I worry when I go on the street that the police will stop me and ask me for my papers because of the color of my skin , by my tone of skin , by my way of walking . &quot; 
Given its failings , why is ethnic profiling so widespread ? 
The answer is simple . 
When the police use ethnic profiling , they project an image of being tough on crime and terrorism . 
This appeases public opinion , which demands robust anti-terrorism action . 
Following the September 2001 attacks in New York , and again after the bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005 , law-enforcement authorities across Europe launched mass-arrest operations , undertook widespread surveillance of mosques , carried out stops and searches of people who appeared to be Muslim , and used other intrusive measures that disrupted the lives of - and in many cases humiliated - law-abiding European citizens . 
As public anxiety has abated , and senior officials have felt less pressure to show that they are doing something , the most flagrant abuses have declined . 
But such practices are still being applied to a lesser degree , and they can be pulled out of the arsenal whenever political or social conditions dictate . 
Fortunately , some of Europe &apos;s leaders recognize the problem . 
In late April , the European Parliament issued a report highlighting the danger that unrestricted data mining that relies on racial , ethnic , or national origin would subject innocent people to arbitrary stops , travel restrictions , and bans on employment or banking . 
The report called for legislation to protect against ethnic profiling . 
The solution is not to ignore the threat of terrorism , but to address the threat more intelligently . 
Over the past two years , a project that our organization undertook with police forces and civil-society groups in Hungary and Spain found that , when stops were systematically monitored and data publicly reported , the proportion of stops that produced an arrest or other law-enforcement outcome actually increased . 
Police work became more efficient . 
This makes sense . 
When officers are required to articulate grounds for suspicion , they are more likely to rely on behavioral factors rather than prejudice . 
In the future , the European Union and its member states should fund more collaboration between police and minority communities . 
The EU should combat radicalization by addressing exclusion , not by conflating conservative religious faith with terrorism . 
And it should make clear that police may not use ethnic , racial , or religious stereotypes . 
By treating people as suspicious purely because of who they are , how they look , or where they pray , rather than what they do or have done , ethnic profiling threatens the very ethos of the EU , a union firmly rooted in values of liberty , democracy , and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
