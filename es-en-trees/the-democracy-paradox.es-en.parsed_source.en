The Democracy Paradox 
PARIS - Elections stolen in Iran , disputed in Afghanistan , and caricatured in Gabon : recent ballots in these and many other countries do not so much mark the global advance of democracy as demonstrate the absence of the rule of law . 
Of course , elections that lead to illiberal outcomes , and even to despotism , are not a new phenomenon . 
Hitler , after all , came to power in Germany in 1933 through a free , fair , and competitive election . 
Moreover , problematic elections constitute a specific challenge for the West , which is simultaneously the bearer of a universal democratic message and the culprit of an imperialist past that undermines that message &apos;s persuasiveness and utility . 
In a noted essay in 2004 , for example , the Indian-born author Fareed Zakaria described the danger of what he called &quot; illiberal democracy . &quot; 
By contrast , Zakaria argued , Venezuela &apos;s populist president , Hugo Ch√°vez , who was legitimately elected , should be opposed . 
In our globalized world , the potential divorce between elections and democracy has assumed a new dimension . 
With instantaneous communication and access to information , the less legitimate a regime , the greater will be the temptation for it to manipulate , if not fabricate , the results of elections . 
The &quot; trendy &quot; way is to manufacture a significant but not too massive victory . 
Today &apos;s despots view near-unanimous Soviet-style electoral &quot; victories &quot; as vulgar and old fashioned . 
But another new aspect of this phenomenon are opposition forces that are willing to attempt to negate such machinations by the party in power . 
Confronted with this dual process of illegitimacy , the West often finds itself condemned to sit between two chairs , and to face criticism whatever the outcome . 
Those in power , as in Iran , accuse Western governments of supporting the opposition , and those in opposition accuse the West of supporting the government , as has happened to France in the case of Gabon . 
So what lessons should we draw from the inevitably messy nature of electoral processes in countries where there is either no middle class or only a rudimentary one , and where a democratic culture is at best in its infancy ? 
The time has come for the West to reassess its policies in a fundamental way . 
It cannot switch from &quot; activism &quot; at one moment to abstention the next . 
A refusal to act , after all , is also a political choice . 
Of course , the temptations of isolationism are great , and will increase in the months and years ahead . 
But the West has neither the moral right nor a strategic possibility of withdrawing into an &quot; ivory tower , &quot; something which in most cases does not exist . 
It is impossible to say to Afghanistan , for example , &quot; You have deeply disappointed us , so , from now on , you must clean up your own mess . &quot; 
In Afghanistan , Gabon , Iran , Pakistan , and elsewhere , fundamental Western interests - though very different depending on the case - are at stake . 
In Afghanistan , the danger is that a terrorist haven could be reconstituted . 
The risk in Iran is an ever more hostile regime armed with nuclear weapons . 
In Gabon , the priority for France is to transcend neo-colonialism without losing its important links to the oil-rich African nation . 
But , in pursuit of these difficult objectives , the West must get both its ambitions and its methods right . 
Democracy is a legitimate objective , but it is a long-term one . 
In the medium term , the absence of the rule of law constitutes the most serious problem for the countries in question . 
French television , for example , recently aired a terrifying report on Haiti , where a local judge , without bothering to hide his actions , was protecting a narcotics dealer from the country &apos;s own French-trained anti-drug force . 
Corruption eats away at a society from within , destroying citizens &quot; trust in a future based on a shared sense of common good . 
It is the West &apos;s acceptance of corruption - either open or tacit - that makes it an accomplice to too many nefarious regimes , and makes its espousal of democratic principles appear either hypocritical or contradictory . 
On the other hand , setting the rule-of-law standard too high will also misfire . 
Singapore-style incorruptible one-party state bent on modernizing society is probably a far too ambitious goal for most non-democratic regimes . 
The distance that separates the West from countries that rely on sham elections is not only geographic , religious , or cultural ; it is chronological . 
Their &quot; time &quot; is not , has never been , or is no longer the same as that of the West . 
How can they be understood without being judged , or helped without humiliating paternalism or , still worse , without an unacceptable &quot; collateral damage , &quot; as in Afghanistan ? 
The West &apos;s status in tomorrow &apos;s world will largely depend upon how it answers this question . 
It cannot afford to ignore the issue any longer .
