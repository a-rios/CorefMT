Joking about Science 
ITHACA , NEW YORK - An apocryphal story sometimes heard among physicists concerns a toast , proposed by his Cambridge University colleagues , to J. J. Thomson &apos;s discovery of the electron in 1897 : &quot; To the electron : may it never be of use to anyone ! &quot; 
Pure mathematicians supposedly tell a similar joke about their profession . 
Why should it be considered witty to celebrate the uselessness of knowledge ? 
I witnessed a similar attitude from a cosmologist when I participated in a radio show a few years ago : the host remarked to him that his research &quot; has virtually no practical applicability , &quot; to which he quickly replied , &quot; I &apos;m proud of that , yes . &quot; 
These jokes all seem to rely on the same assumption : everyone thinks that knowledge , especially scientific knowledge , should be useful . 
So it &apos;s funny to boast that one &apos;s own brand of knowledge , whether experimental physics , mathematics , or cosmology , is useless . 
But the joke wouldn &apos;t work if there were not at the same time another widely shared assumption that scientific knowledge has a value independent of any practical use . 
After all , it would not be funny if a charity dedicated to famine relief celebrated its own ineffectiveness ; practical value in that case would be paramount , because it would be the only real reason for the charity to exist . 
So , even though potential usefulness is the reason why governments devote so much money to scientific research , people really expect more from science than that . 
On this view , science also has a quite different , higher aim : understanding the natural world . 
Einstein may have drawn US President Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s attention to the possibility of making nuclear weapons , but he is chiefly remembered for his profound ideas about the nature of the universe . 
More recent scientific gurus , such as Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking , have presented a similar image to the public . 
Science from this perspective is about natural philosophy , an enterprise that seeks to acquire deep understanding of the world regardless of whether that knowledge can be put to use . 
Jokes also betray a certain uneasiness about the apparent contradictions that they reveal . 
In this case , the uneasiness derives from a fundamental uncertainty about which of the two faces of science , natural philosophy or instrumentality , represents its true character . 
Is science really about understanding the world , with instrumentality being a matter of fortuitous spin-offs ? 
Or is it really about putting the natural world to human uses , with natural philosophy being little more than a language to account for why certain techniques work ? 
The nineteenth century invented the familiar terms &quot; pure &quot; and &quot; applied &quot; science as a way of reconciling these alternative understandings . 
Pure science , as the name suggests , is presented as the &quot; real thing , &quot; untainted by practical considerations and rooted in properly conducted empirical and theoretical investigation of nature . 
Applied science takes the knowledge provided by pure science and puts it to work . 
But that straightforward picture bears little resemblance to the complexities of real scientific activity : if applied science involved nothing more than the application of the results of pure science , there would be no need for &quot; research and development &quot; departments in manufacturing corporations , or research laboratories at chemical or electronics companies . 
The instrumental achievements of science would depend solely on the scraps falling from the pure scientist &apos;s table . 
In fact , the two faces of science are much more intimately interwoven - less like faces than like two ingredients of a thoroughly stirred mixture . 
&quot; Truth and utility , &quot; wrote Francis Bacon , the early seventeenth-century English philosopher and statesman , &quot; are the very same things . &quot; 
In other words , the truth of beliefs about the world is guaranteed only by the capacity of those beliefs to be turned into actions that produce the practical outcomes that human beings desire . 
What we understand as the instrumentality of science was , for Bacon , nothing but the other side of the scientific coin . 
Where the poet John Keats wrote &quot; Beauty is truth , truth beauty , &quot; Bacon might have said , &quot; Utility is truth , truth utility &quot; - as long as we take &quot; utility &quot; in a very broad sense . 
But we don &apos;t believe Bacon , either . 
Like Bacon , we value utility because it seems to lend credibility to the claims that science makes about the nature of the world - science is true because it works . 
But , at the same time , we won &apos;t allow science to be reduced to practical utility , because that would destroy its intellectual status , as well as the intellectual status of scientists themselves , and would prevent science from giving explanations . 
So science must retain its claim to being natural philosophy , too . 
Sometimes we believe that science is natural philosophy , and sometimes we believe that science is instrumentality . 
But in fact it &apos;s both simultaneously , neither &quot; pure &quot; nor &quot; applied . &quot; 
If we could acknowledge that , we wouldn &apos;t be joking about it .
