From Karl Popper to Karl Rove - and Back 
NEW YORK  -  
The United States remains a democracy governed by a constitution and the rule of law , with pluralistic media , yet there are disturbing signs that the propaganda methods Orwell described have taken root here . 
Indeed , techniques of deception have undergone enormous improvements since Orwell &apos;s time . 
Many of these techniques were developed in connection with the advertising and marketing of commercial products and services , and then adapted to politics . 
Their distinguishing fea ­ ture is that they can be bought for money . 
More recently , cogni ­ tive science has helped to make the techniques of deception even more effective , giving rise to political professionals who concentrate only on &quot; get ­ ting results . &quot; 
These professionals take pride in their ac ­ complishments , and may even enjoy the respect of an American public that admires success no matter how it is achieved . 
That fact casts doubt on Karl Popper &apos;s concept of open society , which is based on the recognition that , while perfect knowledge is unattainable , we can gain a better understanding of reality by engaging in critical thinking . 
Popper failed to recognize that in democratic politics , gathering public support takes prece ­ dence over the pursuit of truth . 
In other areas , such as science and industry , the impulse to impose one &apos;s views on the world encounters the resistance of external reality . 
But in politics the electorate &apos;s perception of reality can be easily manipulated . 
As a result , political discourse , even in democratic societies , does not necessarily lead to a better understanding of reality . 
The reason democratic politics leads to manipulation is that politicians do not aspire to tell the truth . 
They want to win elections , and the best way to do that is to skew reality to their own benefit . 
This insight should lead us not to abandon the concept of open society , but to revise and reaffirm the case for it . 
We must abandon Popper &apos;s tacit assumption that political discourse aims at a better understanding of reality and reintroduce it as an explicit requirement . 
The separation of powers , free speech , and free elections alone cannot ensure open society ; a strong commitment to the pursuit of truth is also required . 
We need to introduce new ground rules for political discourse . 
These cannot be identi ­ cal to scientific method , but they should be similar in character , enshrining the pursuit of truth as the criteria on which political views are to be judged . 
Politicians will respect , rather than manipulate , reality only if the public cares about the truth and punishes politicians when it catches them in deliber ­ ate deception . 
And the public should care about the truth because deception misleads people in choosing their representatives , distorts policy choices , undermines ac ­ countability , and destroys trust in democracy . 
Recent history provides convincing evidence that policies based on a misrepresenting reality backfire . 
The Bush administration &apos;s response to the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 - declaring a War on Terror and treating criticism as unpatriotic - succeeded in gathering public support , yet the results were the exact opposite to what the Bush administration intended , both for itself and the United States . 
The practical difficulty is in recognizing when political profes ­ sionals are distorting reality . 
There is an important role here for the media , the political elite , and the educational system , which must all act as watchdogs . 
In addition , the public needs to be inoculated against the various tech ­ niques of deception . 
The most ef ­ fective techniques operate at the subconscious level . 
When emotions can be aroused by methods that bypass consciousness , the public is left largely defenseless . 
But if the public is made aware of the various techniques , it is likely to reject them . 
One influential technique - which Republican pollster Frank Luntz says that he learned from 1984 - simply reverses meanings and turns reality on its head . 
Thus , Fox News calls itself &quot; fair and balanced , &quot; and Karl Rove and his acolytes turn their opponents &quot; strongest traits into their Achilles &quot; heels , using insinuations and lies to portray the opponents &quot; achievements as phony . 
That is how insinuations of cowardice and foul play helped defeat two highly decorated Vietnam War veterans , Senator Max Cleland in 2002 , and John Kerry in 2004 , while Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney - both of whom avoided military service ­ - were portrayed as true patriots . 
Another technique is transference : accusing opponents of having motives or using methods that characterize the accuser himself . 
For example , David Horowitz , who accuses me of being &quot; the Lenin of the anti-American conspiracy , &quot; is a former Trotskyite for whom opponents are never adversaries to be debated , but rather enemies to be crushed . 
The American public has proven remarkably susceptible to the manipulation of truth , which increasingly dominates the country &apos;s political discourse . 
Indeed , a whole net ­ work of publications , some of which manage to parade as mainstream media , is devoted to the task . 
Yet I believe that it is possible to inoculate the public against false arguments by arousing resent ­ ment against Orwellian Newspeak . 
What is needed is a concerted effort to iden ­ tify the techniques of manipulation - and to name and shame those who use them . 
Now is an ideal time to begin that effort . 
Americans are now awakening , as if from a bad dream . 
What we have learned from recent years &quot; experience - what we should have known all along - is that the supremacy of critical thought in political dis ­ course cannot be taken for granted . 
It can be ensured only by an electorate that respects reality and punishes politicians who lie or engage in other forms of deception .
