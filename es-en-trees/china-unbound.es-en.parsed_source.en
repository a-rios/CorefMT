China Unbound 
Sydney - The appointment of five provincial-level Chinese Communist Party chiefs in early December is a reminder that the ascension of China &apos;s next generation of leaders , who will take power in 2012 , may be the most significant development in Chinese politics since Deng Xiaoping &apos;s reign begin in 1978 . 
The upcoming generation of leaders will be the first with little or no personal memory of the turmoil and hardship endured during the Mao Zedong years . 
Forgetting that history might doom China to repeat the mistakes of the past ; but , for better or worse , it might also ease constraints and set its leaders free . 
All five appointees were born after the founding of the People &apos;s Republic in 1949 . 
Two of them , Hu Chunhua and Sun Zhengcai , are only 46 years old . 
This is in line with the Party &apos;s recently announced policy that the next generation of leaders should have an average age of around 55 years , with up to four top positions filled by leaders not yet in their fifties . 
The Party &apos;s aim is to ensure that it remains energetic and dynamic as China rises . 
This seems a wise decision . 
Chinese leadership over the past decade and a half has been about fine-tuning and maintaining the momentum of Deng &apos;s state-led development model , launched after the Tiananmen protests of 1989 . 
In this respect , China &apos;s third and fourth generation of leaders , under the technocrats Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao , have been competent but unimaginative . 
But the viability of Deng &apos;s model is nearing its end , and China is now addicted to inefficient state-led fixed investment and unsustainable export-led growth , rather than domestic consumption , to generate jobs and growth . 
Progress on further structural reforms - such as currency and capital-account liberalization and weaning state-controlled industries off state capital - has been slow , and new initiatives have been piecemeal rather than comprehensive . 
Likewise , since the mid-1990 &quot; s , China &apos;s foreign policy has been cautious rather than bold . 
Both Jiang and Hu have faithfully followed Deng &apos;s dictum to &quot; Hide capacity and nourish obscurity . &quot; 
Although increasingly assertive in Africa and Latin America , China largely remains a free-rider under the American security umbrella . 
The older generations see such caution as prudence , and that conservatism is reflected in China &apos;s current leaders . 
The lack of big-picture reform attests to the older generations &quot; collective fear that fundamental structural changes will bring disruption and chaos , threatening the Party &apos;s hold on power . 
They still remember the suffering of the Mao years , when China headed in the wrong direction - and tried to do too much too quickly - and they vividly recall how the Tiananmen protests brought the regime to its knees , and how urban labor unrest erupted when centrally managed state businesses were merged or closed down in the 1990 &quot; s . 
Similarly , though China remains fundamentally dissatisfied with its southern land borders and its sea borders to the east and southeast , its current leaders fear that isolation would result from an assertive and aggressive foreign policy . 
All elites - young and old - see China as Asia &apos;s natural leader and America as a recent interloper . 
But , for the third and fourth generation leaders , giving America and its allies and partners an excuse to &quot; contain &quot; China - and restrict its economic development - remains the great nightmare . 
Without personal experience of China &apos;s recent traumatic history , the next generation will be more confident and assertive . 
Schooled in economics , politics , and law , rather than engineering , they will seek to accelerate China &apos;s rise and transformation , viewing caution as paralysis . 
Even now , emerging leaders argue that China is moving too slowly on economic reform and foreign-policy goals . 
For better or worse , they will not be restrained by the same fear of unintended consequences when it comes to change and experimentation . 
Optimists hope that this might hasten economic liberalization , and perhaps even lead to moderate political reform , especially greater accountability for far-flung local officials . 
After all , it has been China &apos;s young guns who consistently raise the issue of local corruption at Party summits . 
But the foreign-policy consequences could be even greater . 
Having grown up in a China that is now accepted as a legitimate great power , the new generation of leaders will be more impatient about China resuming its place as the paramount power in Asia . 
While older statesmen take pride in how far China has come , younger Party figures and elites - especially those who have returned from American and other Western graduate schools - are frustrated by that China &apos;s strategic position in Asia and status within global and regional institutions remain relatively weak , despite the country &apos;s rising economic power . 
For example , much of the talk that China should take the lead in regional institutions , and that Chinese ships should have a greater presence in vital sea lanes such as the Malacca Straits and even the Indian Ocean comes from the younger generation . 
The younger Party leaders are also more impatient when it comes to a timeframe for winning back Taiwan . 
China is currently in a holding pattern . 
But that will end when the next generation of leaders assumes power in 2012 . 
When their time comes , the world will be dealing with a much more unpredictable power than the one we know now .
