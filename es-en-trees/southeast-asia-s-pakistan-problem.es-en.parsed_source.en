Southeast Asia &apos;s Pakistan Problem 
Pakistan &apos;s near political chaos , the result of President Pervez Musharraf &apos;s declaration of martial law last year and the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , has had a tsunami-like impact across Southeast Asia . 
Should Musharraf &apos;s government backslide even more on its commitments to restore parliamentary democracy , Pakistan &apos;s crisis would not only be exacerbated , but it might begin to infect the wider region . 
At direct stake today is Pakistan &apos;s future , but its future may determine the political fates of neighboring countries that are also struggling with violent Islamic fundamentalism . 
Will Pakistan be dragged along the path of Islamic extremism and emergency rule , or finally achieve modernity as a secular nation under civilian leadership ? 
That choice matters as an example across Asia , because Pakistan has long been the traditional sanctuary of Al Qaeda and its Taliban cohorts , who hide in the inhospitable Pakistani-Afghani border region . 
These Islamic terrorists , with their global reach , could well tilt the balance from one extreme to the other in a number of countries . 
The fallout from Bhutto &apos;s assassination was bound to reach beyond Pakistan &apos;s borders . 
The country &apos;s mushrooming instability has triggered a bitter debate in the United States about the long-term viability of Musharraf &apos;s military-backed government and whether US financial support for Pakistan should continue . 
Now , however , is not the time to freeze out Pakistan , despite the seeming chaos . 
Last September , Osama bin Laden &apos;s deputy , Al-Zawahiri , released videotapes calling for jihad in Pakistan and around the world . 
Bin Laden &apos;s most recent threats have been equally universal . 
Indeed , given extremist violence in Sri Lanka ( Tamil Tigers ) , West Bengal ( Naxalites ) , Bangladesh ( Islamic fundamentalists ) , Southern Thailand ( Islamic separatists ) , Java ( Jemaah Islamiyah ) , and Basilan ( Abu Sayyaf ) , the possibility that Al Qaeda and its satellites are plotting attacks elsewhere , especially against soft targets , poses a real danger to the region . 
Regional leaders understand this . 
A year ago at their Cebu ( Philippines ) summit , the leaders of ASEAN adopted the &quot; ASEAN Convention Against Terrorism . &quot; 
The Convention aims to prevent the commission of terrorist acts by implementing early warning systems ; the use of ASEAN members &quot; respective territories by those who finance , plan , facilitate , or commit terrorist acts ; and movement of terrorists and terrorist groups by means of effective border control and identity / travel documentation . 
But cooperation against terror is easier said than done , given the region &apos;s diversity of governance , culture , language , and religion , as well as ASEAN &apos;s central policy of keeping out of non-interference in its members &quot; internal affairs . 
This policy has enabled the group to remain united over the years , despite severe disagreements . 
Where anti-terrorist planning is concerned , however , non-interference has become ASEAN &apos;s biggest handicap . 
Yet to be forewarned of a weakness is to be forearmed . 
The first and crucial preventive step that any government can take in the face of a renewed Al Qaeda offensive in southeast Asia is fully to respect the creativity , mobility , technical expertise , and financial capabilities of suicidal groups . 
Recall a letter from the convicted terrorist Ramzi Yousef , which was found in his Islamabad safe house after he was arrested in February 1995 . 
Yousef seethed with resentment about the discovery of his &quot; Bojinka &quot; ( explosives ) cell in Manila the month before and vowed : 
We will take the harshest of measures in order that all Filipino interests inside and outside the Philippines will be subject to destruction .... Our measures will include assassinating prominent figures , foremost among them the Filipino President ( RAMOS ) .... We also have the ability to use chemicals and poisonous gas against vital institutions , residential populations , and drinking water sources ... 
At the height of the Soviet-Afghanistan war in the 1980 &quot; s , Pakistan was the covert conduit for Filipino Muslim militants passing to and from Afghanistan and back to the island of Mindanao , which has long been a stronghold of Muslim rebels . 
Their experience in guerrilla warfare produced leaders such as the brothers Abdurajak and Khadaffy Janjalani who founded the terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group , which is now wrecking havoc in the Philippines . 
Indeed , just last November , a member of the Philippines &quot; Congress , Wahab Akbar , a Muslim representing Basilan , was killed with five others in front of the House of Representatives by an improvised explosive device of the type used in Pakistan , Afghanistan , and Iraq . 
His death should serve as a warning to all Southeast Asian governments : we must fight Al Qaeda together , or we shall lose to them separately .
