One Hundred Days of Solitude 
SANTIAGO - When violence flared up in Ukraine and protesters began dying at the hands of government agents , the European Union threatened sanctions against Ukrainian officials responsible for &quot; violence and excessive force . &quot; 
President Viktor Yanukovych fled Kyiv , leaving behind a private zoo with exotic pigs and goats - and also the foreign ministers of Germany , France , and Poland , who were in town trying to broker a deal to end the violence . 
But when violence flared up - virtually simultaneously - in Venezuela and protesters began dying at the hands of government agents , the Organization of American States raised its voice to announce that ... it would not raise its voice . 
The situation was up to Venezuela to sort out , the OAS stated . 
Foreign ministers from other Latin American countries are nowhere to be seen in Caracas - certainly not denouncing repression and demanding an end to the violence . 
Meanwhile , the body count keeps rising . 
The contrast highlights what everyone already knows : Latin America &apos;s regional institutions are weak - even weaker than Europe &apos;s . 
But it also reveals something else : a morally crooked logic that condemns governments and leaders to remain silent in the face of aggression , repression , and even death , because to say anything would be tantamount to &quot; intervention &quot; in another country &apos;s internal affairs . 
It was not always like this . 
Not long ago in Latin America , life and liberty were deemed to be universal rights , to be defended across national borders . 
My father was a Chilean lawyer and human-rights activist . 
General Augusto Pinochet kicked him and our family out of the country , and I spent my adolescence and early adulthood in exile , sharing hopes and fears with other expatriates from Chile , Argentina , Brazil , and Uruguay . 
None of us - and no one on the Latin American left - would have doubted for a moment that defending human rights was everyone &apos;s responsibility , and that the international community should come down hard on governments that tortured and killed their own people . 
In Pinochet &apos;s Chile or General Jorge Rafael Videla &apos;s Argentina , anyone who complained about government-sponsored violence was painted as a member of an international communist conspiracy . 
Today , anyone who complains about violence in Venezuela is , according to President Nicolás Maduro , a fascist and a lackey of the American empire . 
Everything has changed , yet everything remains the same . 
Yes , the situation in Venezuela must be sorted out by Venezuelans . 
The problem is that some Venezuelans today cannot march peacefully on the streets without being shot at . 
Some Venezuelans cannot speak freely to their fellow citizens , because each and every television station that would carry their words has been muzzled or driven off the air . 
And some Venezuelans cannot be sure their rights will be respected . 
Terms in office have expired for the prosecutor-general , members of the national election commission , and supreme court justices , but no successors have been named , because Maduro is unwilling to negotiate with the opposition and lacks the two-thirds majority in the National Assembly needed to appoint officials of his choosing . 
Venezuelans would like nothing better than to be the ones who decide their own destiny , but the democratic means to do so are being denied to them . 
Indeed , one of the key opposition leaders , Leopoldo López , has been arrested on ludicrous charges of &quot; inciting crime . &quot; 
It would have been preposterous to tell Ukrainian demonstrators facing government storm troopers to just grin and bear it without any external solidarity or support . 
It is just as preposterous to tell Venezuelan demonstrators the same thing . 
In these circumstances , the principle of self-determination , so beloved of foreign ministries everywhere , becomes an empty slogan . 
Perhaps the saddest of all foreign reactions came from the University of Chile &apos;s student federation . 
Using language reminiscent of the Stalinist 1950 &quot; s , the federation - which has led student protests demanding better education in Chile - condemned their Venezuelan counterparts for &quot; defending the old order &quot; and &quot; deviating from the path the people have chosen . &quot; 
The problem with this argument ( if one can call it that ) is that &quot; the people &quot; do not speak with one voice , nor do their pronouncements fall fully formed from the sky . 
To figure out what real people actually want and respond accordingly , democracies have procedures , constitutional guarantees , and individual rights . 
When these are trampled upon , as they have been in Venezuela , people can neither speak freely nor choose their path . 
It is equally silly to argue that Maduro &apos;s actions must be legitimate because he came to power through an election . 
A democratically elected leader retains legitimacy only to the extent that he or she behaves democratically once in office . 
As Georgetown professor Hector Schamis recently recalled , António de Oliveira Salazar in Portugal , Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay , and Suharto in Indonesia attained power through elections , yet no history book calls them democratic . 
Yanukovych , too , won an election , but he will be remembered mostly for the bloodshed he unleashed , the bankruptcy that now faces Ukraine &apos;s economy , and , of course , his private zoo and stable of Ferraris . 
Venezuelans , like Ukrainians , should know that they are not alone . 
Their struggle for democratic rights is everyone &apos;s struggle . 
People in Latin America know this , even if their leaders are not always willing to say it out loud .
