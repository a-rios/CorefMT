The Terrorist Next Door 
NEW DELHI - Recent incidents on the Line of Control ( LoC ) - the frontier between India and Pakistan in the state of Jammu and Kashmir - have again raised fundamental questions about the nuclear-armed neighbors &quot; fraught relationship . 
Early this month , India &apos;s army foiled an attempted incursion by a group of 30 to 40 militants from Pakistani territory , leading Indian critics to decry official peace overtures . 
Indeed , barely two weeks before the latest incident , Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with his Pakistani counterpart , Nawaz Sharif , during the United Nations General Assembly session in New York . 
Pakistan was hacked off the stooped shoulders of India by the departing British in 1947 as a homeland for India &apos;s Muslims ; but , until recently ( as Pakistan &apos;s population continues to grow at a higher rate than India &apos;s ) , more Muslims remained in India than lived in Pakistan . 
Bilateral relations have been bedeviled ever since by a festering dispute over the divided territory of Kashmir , India &apos;s only Muslim-majority state ( but home to only 3 % of India &apos;s Muslims , who are scattered in larger numbers throughout the country ) . 
For decades , open conflict and simmering hostility have been punctuated by periods of short-lived bonhomie . 
The principal obstacle to peace has been Pakistan &apos;s sponsorship of militancy and terrorism within India , culminating in the horrific attacks in Mumbai in November 2008 , in which terrorist commandos killed almost 200 people . 
In the late 1980 &quot; s , Pakistan backed an insurrection by some Kashmiri Muslims and supplied arms , training , and funds to militants who infiltrated across the LoC . 
The insurrection , which continues to this day , and Indian security forces &quot; response to it have caused great loss of life and property , and have all but wrecked the state &apos;s economy , which is largely dependent on tourism . 
In the process , both countries have suffered grievously . 
Indian citizens have been killed in large numbers , while the government has had to deploy more than a half-million soldiers to keep the peace . 
And Pakistan &apos;s strategy of &quot; bleeding India to death by a thousand cuts &quot; through insurgency and terrorism has accomplished little , while making its military an enormously powerful domestic player and spawning terror outfits ( some of which have turned against their sponsors ) . 
In June , when Sharif became the first prime minister in Pakistan &apos;s checkered political history to succeed a democratically elected prime minister through another democratic election , there was hope in India that the balance of power might shift from the military to the civilian government . 
During his election campaign , and after his victory , Sharif expressed a determination to make peace with India . 
Despite the historical pattern of Pakistani civilian leaders talking peace while armed men slip across the border , many in India believe that this time might be different . 
But many also remain skeptical . 
Singh sat down with Sharif after a series of incidents on the LoC led his critics to urge him not to proceed with the meeting . 
India , the government &apos;s critics argue , has taken upon itself the enormous burden of talking peace with a government that , when it comes to addressing the real threats emanating from its territory and institutions , has proved to be ineffective at best and duplicitous at worst . 
The latest attempted infiltration - which Indian military leaders say could not have occurred without the Pakistani army &apos;s complicity - has added to the outcry against the government for its alleged naivet√© . 
In pursuing peace with Pakistan , India &apos;s government is indeed rolling the dice . 
As the Mumbai attack five years ago and the recent LoC incidents have shown , the gap between Pakistan &apos;s official statements and its military &apos;s actions suggests that the civilian government , even if sincere , is too weak to control its own security apparatus . 
So long as Pakistan &apos;s government remains either unable or unwilling to push back against the so-called &quot; non-state actors &quot; that are said to be out of its control , why should India pursue the dialogue that it called off in 2008 ? 
Yet India &apos;s peaceniks are not wrong . 
A country that seeks to focus on its own enormous development challenges should do everything it can to defuse hostility on its borders . 
Not talking to Pakistan is not much of a policy ; it has been tried for years , yielding no significant benefit . 
If India &apos;s pursuit of peace strengthens like-minded Pakistani politicians who are struggling against their own hawks , it is worth attempting . 
The benefits of peace , for both sides , would be enormous . 
But it has always been India , a status quo power , that wishes to live in peace , while Pakistan , craving Kashmir , uses every means at its disposal to alter the status quo . 
For this reason , India &apos;s army must be well prepared and vigilant in defense of the country &apos;s borders . 
But , unlike in Pakistan , the army in India does not make foreign policy . 
That is the prerogative of an elected civilian government that is determined to engage in dialogue with its eyes open ( and its weapons at the ready ) . 
It would help if Pakistan &apos;s government - facing home-grown terrorists even as it exports terror to its neighbors - showed a little more willingness to join the quest for peace . 
The moment the Pakistani establishment genuinely disavows terrorism as an instrument of state policy , the prospect of peace will dawn on the subcontinent . 
Alas , that prospect is not yet even a glimmer on the horizon .
