The Unmaking of the President 
WASHINGTON , DC - Barack Obama was widely considered an exciting new figure when he was first elected President of the United States in 2008 . 
His increasing unpopularity and virtual abandonment by his own party in his second term in 2014 stems largely from that fact : Expectations exceeded reality . 
But , more important , reality changed - in several ways . 
He has in fact accomplished much in nearly impossible circumstances . 
Likewise , he got his landmark health-care reform , the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , passed . 
He has also taken significant steps to uphold the rights of women and sexual minorities , and has used his executive power to loosen immigration restrictions on families amid congressional paralysis . 
An assessment of Obama &apos;s presidency must focus not just on him , but also on the Republicans &quot; unprecedented hostility . 
Even before Obama took office , Republican leaders were plotting to oppose his every proposal , so he could not claim bipartisan support . 
No Republican voted for Obama &apos;s health-care legislation , even though it was modeled on schemes backed by some Republican officials and prominent think tanks . 
The Republicans &quot; most ingenious trick was to use procedural measures to keep bills from being brought to a vote in the Senate , so that the public would ultimately blame &quot; the stalemate in Washington &quot; on Obama . 
As his poll ratings began to drop , reaching the low forties , Democrats made the tactical error of running away from him . 
As a result , in November &apos;s midterm congressional election , the Democrats , unwilling to support any Obama-associated policy , waged a campaign about nothing , contributing to low turnout among their party &apos;s voters . 
Republican candidates , running highly charged anti-Obama campaigns , trounced their opponents . 
Of course , no honest discussion of Obama &apos;s presidency can ignore the role of his race . 
America , it turned out , was far less ready for a black president than his supporters expected ( or hoped ) , exemplified in virulent attacks that exceed the norm for a president . 
Moreover , Obama &apos;s approach to issues involving race has been fettered by his fear , expressed in his early memoir Dreams From My Father , of being perceived ( even by his white mother ) as an &quot; angry black . &quot; 
To his credit , however , he has been effective in navigating the racial thicket of Ferguson , Missouri , by turning the killing of an unarmed teenager into a focal point for national action to improve police methods . 
Obama &apos;s personality has also contributed to his problems . 
In his astonishingly swift rise , he was virtually alone - a Democrat , but not a creature of the Democratic Party , a politician of progressive instincts , but not an ideologue . 
Moreover , he has little use for small talk or the grubbier side of politics , and his overweening pride in his exceptional intelligence makes him impatient with others &quot; ideas . 
As a result , members of Congress , business figures , and others have felt put off in his presence - even insulted by his remoteness . 
More broadly , Obama &apos;s approach to governing has run counter to his early claim that he wanted to create a &quot; team of rivals &quot; that would offer competing views . 
His preference for surrounding himself with people who have proved their loyalty has produced a White House staff that is widely considered , even by some cabinet officials , to be less than stellar . 
It is also a staff that has exercised tight control over policy . 
The emphasis on loyalty is particularly glaring on the national-security front . 
National Security Adviser Susan Rice , who has been with Obama since 2008 , is said to be intelligent but lacking in strategic vision . 
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel could not penetrate the bastion around Rice , and his dissent on policy toward Syria , which he often took directly to Obama , was not appreciated . 
After the midterm elections , Hagel - Obama &apos;s third defense secretary in six years - became the floundering administration &apos;s sacrificial lamb . 
Given Hagel &apos;s good standing in Washington , the move reflected poorly on the administration . 
Obama is unlikely to find much refuge from domestic struggles in the last redoubt of previous lame-duck presidents : foreign policy . 
Obama should not be blamed for the foreign-policy challenges that the US now faces . 
It would be a tough time for any US president to try to assert global leadership - a fact that the Republicans choose to overlook . 
But , brilliant as Obama is , he has been prone to making odd mistakes . 
With a seemingly out-of-control John McCain taking over as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , the situation is likely to become even more complicated . 
As American politics becomes more polarized , and as Obama struggles to manage the challenges posed by epochal global developments , large domestic programs to address rising income inequality are probably beyond his administration &apos;s reach . 
And , though there is no shortage of candidates lining up to succeed him in 2016 , one might wonder , after his experience , why anyone would want the job .
