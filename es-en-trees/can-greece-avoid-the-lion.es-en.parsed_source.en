Can Greece Avoid the Lion ? 
ATHENS ­ ­ - Even as the European Union and the International Monetary Fund lay the groundwork for a giant first-round bailout , debate is swirling about whether Greece can avoid sovereign default . 
Some view Greece as Argentina revisited , noting the stunning parallels with the country that in 2001 set the record for the world &apos;s largest default ( in dollar terms ) . 
Others , such as Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou , see the country &apos;s problems as difficult but manageable , and complain of interference from ill-intentioned foreign speculators . 
Avoiding default may be possible , but it will not be easy . 
One has only to look at official data , including Greece &apos;s external debt , which amounts to 170 % of national income , or its gaping government budget deficit ( almost 13 % of GDP ) . 
But the problem is not only the numbers ; it is one of credibility . 
Thanks to decades of low investment in statistical capacity , no one trusts the Greek government &apos;s figures . 
Nor does Greece &apos;s default history inspire confidence . 
As demonstrated in my recent book with Carmen Reinhart This Time is Different : Eight Centuries of Financial Folly , Greece has been in default roughly one out of every two years since it first gained independence in the nineteenth century . 
Loss of credibility , if it comes , can bite hard and fast . 
Indeed , the historical evidence slams you over the head with the fact that , whereas government debt can drift upward inexorably for years , the end usually comes quite suddenly . 
And it can happen to any country , although advanced countries can usually tighten fiscal policy with sufficient speed and credibility that the pain comes mainly in slower growth . 
Unfortunately , for emerging markets , adjustment is often impossible without help from the outside . 
A debt crisis is not inevitable . 
But the government urgently needs to implement credible fiscal adjustment , concentrating not only higher taxation , but also on rolling back some of the incredible growth in government spending - from 45 % of GDP to 52 % of GDP - that occurred between 2007 and 2009 . 
The government must avoid relying too much on proposals for tax increases , which ultimately feed back on growth and sustainability . 
It would be far preferable to balance tax increases with some reversal of runaway government spending . 
I have Greek friends who say that Greece is not alone . 
And they are right . 
Some countries are almost inevitably going to experience bailouts and defaults . 
One of the more striking regularities that Reinhart and I found is that after a wave of international banking crises , a wave of sovereign defaults and restructurings often follows within a few years . 
This correlation is hardly surprising , given the massive build-up in public debts that countries typically experience after a banking crisis . 
We have certainly seen that this time , with crisis countries &quot; debt already having risen by more than 75 % since 2007 . 
But , whereas we are likely to see a wave of defaults and IMF programs this time , too , fiscal meltdown does not have to hit every highly indebted country . 
Indeed , what a country like Greece should be doing is pulling out all the stops to stay clear of the first and second wave of restructurings and IMF programs . 
If it can , then perhaps watching other countries suffer will help convince the local political elite to consent to adjustment . 
If not , Greece will have less control over its adjustment and potentially experience far greater trauma , perhaps eventually outright default . 
There is an old joke about two men who are trapped by a lion in the jungle after a plane crash . 
When the first of them starts putting on his sneakers , the other asks why . 
The first answers : &quot; I am getting ready to make a run for it . &quot; 
But you cannot outrun a lion , says the other man , to which the first replies : &quot; I don &apos;t have to outrun the lion . 
I just have to outrun you . &quot; 
Greece has yet to put on its sneakers , while other troubled countries , such as Ireland , race ahead with massive fiscal adjustments . 
Greece &apos;s new Socialist government is hampered by campaign promises that suggested the money was there to solve the problems , when in fact things turned out to be far worse than anyone imagined . 
Unions and agricultural groups tie up traffic with protests every other day , hinting at possible escalation . 
Most Greeks are taking whatever action they can to avoid the government &apos;s likely insatiable thirst for higher tax revenues , with wealthy individuals shifting money abroad and ordinary people migrating to the underground economy . 
Greece &apos;s underground economy , estimated to be as large as 30 % of GDP , is already one of Europe &apos;s biggest , and it is growing by the day . 
In the case of Argentina , a pair of massive IMF loans in 2000 and 2001 ultimately only delayed the inevitable harsh adjustment , and made the country &apos;s ultimate default even more traumatic . 
Like Argentina , Greece has a fixed exchange rate , a long history of fiscal deficits , and an even longer history of sovereign defaults . 
Nevertheless , Greece can avoid an Argentine-style meltdown , but it needs to engage in far more determined adjustment . 
It is time to put on the running shoes .
