The Globalization of Old Age 
Anti-globalization campaigners gripe that the rich are getting richer . 
That &apos;s true in many ways . 
But rich countries are also getting older . 
This &quot; graying &quot; of the world &apos;s richest nations will profoundly affect not only these societies , but poorer countries as well . 
According to the UN , the world &apos;s population now stands at 6.3 billion and will reach 9.3 billion by mid-century . 
People aged 60 or more are projected to increase from 629 million now to nearly 2 billion by 2050 . 
Furthermore , the elderly population itself is aging . 
The 80 + age group makes up the fastest-growing segment of the population ; its share of the over-60 population will increase from 12 % to 19 % by 2050 . 
This &quot; graying of the world &quot; is a natural result of falling fertility rates and rising life expectancy . 
While the decline in fertility is global , its speed varies across countries . 
Rich countries in Europe , North America , and East Asia have a sharply higher share of the elderly than developing countries . 
Fertility reductions in the richer parts of the world have already brought population growth rates close to zero . 
Furthermore , due to improved access to quality health care and better living conditions , life spans in rich countries are now much longer than in the developing world . 
People aged 60 or more represent almost 20 % of the population in rich countries today , whereas in the world as a whole this ratio is not expected to be reached before 2050 . 
By that point , this age group in industrial countries will claim one-third of the total population . 
It will take another century for the rest of the world to catch up . 
One result of all this is that the relative number of working-age individuals between 15-64 who pay the taxes to support pensioners is declining much faster in the industrial world than in developing countries , where populations remain young and grow rapidly . 
Rich economies are already challenged by this decline , and so are scrambling to meet the insatiable demands of public pension and health care systems , which causes their fiscal balances to deteriorate . 
The effects of population aging will become even more obvious and widespread in the decades ahead , as domestic labor supply in rich countries shrinks even further . 
Moreover , because the elderly tend to spend more and save less , rich countries will also face changes in the ratio of savings to consumption in their national income , as well as in the composition of what is purchased . 
These demographically induced developments will not only affect investment and growth patterns of industrial economies , but the allocation of resources as well . 
In a globalized world , what happens in rich countries has an impact on developing economies . 
Yet , there is little discussion of the opportunities and challenges this presents . 
Nowadays , most talk focuses on migration as a means of letting overpopulated developing countries fill the labor shortages of developed countries with graying populations . 
Japan &apos;s population , for example , is projected to decline by 17.9 million by 2050 , while the share of its 60 + population will climb to 42 % , and the share of its 80 + population will exceed 10 % . 
The number of working-age Japanese will thus fall sharply , bringing the ratio of workers to retirees to about one . 
Estimates suggest that Japan would need 10 million immigrants per year until 2050 just to maintain the ratio of workers to pensioners that it had in 1995 ! 
Will developed countries really allow for migration on such a scale ? 
Or will they instead increase their imports of manufactured products and food , thus creating jobs in developing countries that might help absorb their surplus labor ? 
Even if rich countries choose increased imports , the growing volume of trade will merely expand an existing channel for routing the effects of an aging population onto developing countries . 
Trade serves as such a channel because nations with aging populations are economically powerful and so are capable of setting the terms on which they trade with poorer countries . 
Developing countries that trade intensively with advanced economies must adopt their relative prices and allocate their resources accordingly . 
But these relative prices will increasingly reflect the changed demands of the aging citizenry of industrial nations . 
International capital flows will also magnify such demographic spillover effects , as capital is traded at the interest rates determined in large industrial economies . 
Because the old save less , lower aggregate savings in rich countries will crimp the relative abundance of capital available to poorer economies . 
The powerful combination of globalization and aging will make developing economies ever more susceptible to changes in the terms of trade , interest rates , and exchange rates in rich countries . 
All developing countries should monitor these demographic developments closely , even if they have yet to experience population aging themselves . 
Young nations such as Mexico and Turkey should be particularly careful , due to their strong economic ties with NAFTA and the EU , where the gradual aging of populations is well under way .
