Eurobonds or Bust 
LONDON - The eurozone &apos;s institutional weaknesses have been laid bare . 
The attempt to run a common monetary policy without a common treasury has failed . 
Investors do not know what they are buying when they purchase an Italian bond - is it backstopped by Germany or not ? 
We now know that the best credit must stand behind the rest , or else bear runs , such as those that have derailed Greece , Ireland , and Portugal - and that now threaten to do the same to Italy and Spain - are inevitable . 
Debt mutualization alone will not save the euro , but , without it , the eurozone is unlikely to survive intact . 
The eurozone &apos;s July 21 summit was a small step forward . 
Leaders agreed to lower interest rates on loans made by the European Financial Stability Fund ( EFSF ) and they recognized that Greece &apos;s debt burden is unsustainable . 
But this falls far short of what is needed to arrest the currency union &apos;s deepening crisis . 
Borrowing costs remain unsustainably high for many eurozone economies - and not just those in the periphery . 
The economic growth potential of Spain and Italy , for example , now hovers around 1 % , but their borrowing costs exceed 6 % . 
By contrast , German sovereign yields have fallen sharply , lowering public and private-sector borrowing costs . 
This is a recipe for further economic divergence and insolvency in the eurozone . 
To prevent this , the eurozone needs a &quot; risk-free &quot; interest rate . 
The struggling economies need lower borrowing costs , or they will suffocate economically ( and political support for eurozone membership will evaporate ) . 
Only mutualization of debt issuance can generate the low ( risk-free ) interest rate needed to enable these countries to put their public finances on a sound footing and lay the basis for a return to economic growth . 
All eurozone countries should , therefore , finance debt by issuing bonds that would be jointly guaranteed by all member states . 
The obvious problem with eurobonds is moral hazard : how to prevent fiscally irresponsible countries from free-riding on the credit-worthiness of other member states . 
This is the understandable fear of countries such as Germany and the Netherlands . 
One possible solution would be to permit member states to issue debt as eurobonds up to , say , 60 % of GDP , and to require them to be individually responsible for any debt exceeding that level . 
This would give countries with high levels of public debt an incentive to consolidate their public finances . 
Had the eurozone introduced such a system from the outset , it might well have worked . 
For several eurozone economies , the additional borrowing would simply be too expensive . 
A better solution would be to create a new , independent fiscal body to establish borrowing targets for individual member states , together with a European debt agency to issue eurobonds ( up to a certain level ) on their behalf . 
How would the new fiscal rules be designed ? 
A dogmatic target of budgetary balance four years hence , irrespective of a country &apos;s position in the economic cycle , would achieve little : targets are meaningless if they are impossible to implement . 
So the rules would have to be set with reference to each member state &apos;s cyclically adjusted fiscal position ( for which the OECD already produces estimates ) . 
Careful thought would need to be given to the composition of the new fiscal body . 
A board of 17 people , one from each eurozone economy , would be unwieldy , and unlikely to win the support of the eurozone &apos;s principal creditor countries . 
At the same time , a board dominated by the creditor economies would be unlikely to win the backing of the debtor countries . 
A board of nine economists , from the big eurozone members , the European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the OECD might form a good basis . 
The eurozone , of course , has a poor record of enforcing fiscal rules , implying the need for strong penalties for non-compliance . 
If a country deviated from its fiscal targets , it would be barred from borrowing additional funds at the risk-free interest rate . 
It would have to borrow under its own rating , which would be prohibitively expensive for fiscally weaker countries . 
To provide additional incentives to abide by the rules , the ECB could refuse to accept debt issued under national ratings as collateral . 
Alternatively , a new EU financial regulator could handicap own-country bonds by requiring banks holding them to set aside more capital . 
Fiscal rules of the type envisaged ( and a new body to enforce them ) would not necessarily require a treaty change . 
And , while various creditor countries rightly fear that eurobonds would push up their borrowing costs and constitute a transfer union , opponents might eventually come around to seeing eurobonds as the least bad option . 
The risk is that , by then , it could be too late to save the euro from a partial break-up : what might work if adopted promptly could be ineffective if adopted in six months . 
For core countries , eurobonds would certainly be a cheaper option than underwriting loans to struggling member-states , which essentially means throwing good money after bad . 
They will book large losses on EFSF loans , and those losses will be even larger if , as seems possible , some of the borrowers end up leaving the eurozone and defaulting on their debt .
