Europe in the IMF 
BRUSSELS - Europe &apos;s leaders never tire of reminding their constituencies , almost like a mantra , that the major emerging-market countries are overturning the existing global economic order . 
But when it comes to recognizing that reality in the world &apos;s international financial institutions , they adopt a different tune . 
This is particularly true of the eurozone . 
The eurozone as such has no representation in the international financial institutions . 
Instead , 12 eurozone countries are represented on the board of the International Monetary Fund via six different &quot; constituencies , &quot; or country groups . 
The two largest , Germany and France , have a constituency all their own . 
Ten other eurozone members are part of four other constituencies headed by Belgium , the Netherlands , Spain , and Italy . 
However , these four constituencies also contain more than 20 other countries , most of which are not even EU members . 
Together with the Scandinavian and British constituencies , there are thus eight EU representatives on the IMF &apos;s executive board . 
Given that the IMF &apos;s Articles of Agreement stipulate that there can be only 20 board members , this means that 40 % of all the IMF &apos;s executive directors from the EU , with one-third coming from the eurozone . 
The IMF is a prime example of the over-representation of Europeans in international fora . 
Counter-intuitively , however , the excessive number of Europeans actually diminishes Europe &apos;s influence , because they usually defend national interests , which are often divergent . 
The net effect is that common European interests are not represented at all . 
Contrast this current condition of extended misery with the only sensible long-term solution : a pooling of IMF quotas by all eurozone countries . 
The eurozone would then have one constituency , or seat , on the Fund &apos;s executive board , filled by a candidate nominated by the eurozone group of finance ministers . 
The European Central Bank could also , perhaps , be involved , nominating the deputy of the eurozone executive director at the Fund . 
In this way , Europe &apos;s fiscal and monetary authorities would be forced to cooperate in shaping their input into IMF decisions . 
Many countries ( including Germany ) already follow this &quot; double-headed &quot; approach . 
The eurozone representative would be very influential , because he would represent an even larger quota than that of the US . 
Indeed , the US Treasury &apos;s de facto dominance within the IMF would become a thing of the past . 
But , given the scant interest of European Union members in transferring further competences ( and juicy international positions ) to the EU level , the chances that this solution will prevail seem remote . 
Germany , in particular , feels that it has no reason to share its IMF representation with other , fiscally weaker eurozone members . 
And the French seem scared of contagion : once France agrees to a common eurozone seat at the IMF , others could cite it as a precedent to be applied to the United Nations Security Council , where France would then risk losing its permanent seat to a common EU representative . 
Until now , the rest of world could only grumble at Europe &apos;s obstinate refusal to recognize its relative decline . 
Since no European country would agree to give up its seat on the IMF &apos;s executive board , the only way out was to add more and more temporary seats for the dynamic and underrepresented emerging economies . 
Such a process , however , cannot go on forever , because with each increase in size , the IMF &apos;s board becomes less effective . 
This is why the US has now decided to throw a cat among the European pigeons . 
The US ( which has veto power ) has now taken the stance that it will no longer approve the higher number of executive directors ( 24 at present ) . 
This has confronted the Europeans with a quandary : if they do not agree to give up some seats on the IMF board , some emerging countries , such as Argentina , Brazil , and perhaps even India , would lose theirs . 
The EU does not want to be held responsible for this . 
The pigeons are thus fighting among themselves over who should be sacrificed . 
Until now , it could be argued that the eurozone did not have a common fiscal agency that could represent common eurozone interests . 
But this has changed with the creation of a European rescue fund in the form of the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) . 
Funding the next intra-eurozone rescue will be rather cumbersome and costly , because financial markets distrust complicated structures like the one set up to finance the EFSF . 
This suggests a golden opportunity for Europe to make a virtue of necessity by pooling its access to much-cheaper IMF funding . 
If , for example , Ireland ( or Spain ) needed emergency support , the other eurozone countries could simply agree to lend it their IMF quotas . 
The troubled country could then rapidly obtain a large IMF loan , given that the eurozone countries &quot; quotas total about â‚¬ 60 billion - and that IMF loans can easily reach multiples of the quota . 
Creditor countries like Germany would also gain , because they would not need to extend vast sums in guarantees to the EFSF while still safeguarding their interests within the EFSF &apos;s existing structure . 
All eurozone members , then , have an interest in concentrating in a smaller number of constituencies , with the EFSF representing their collective interests within the IMF .
