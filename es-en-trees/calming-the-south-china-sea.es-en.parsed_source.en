Calming the South China Sea 
CANBERRA - The South China Sea - long regarded , together with the Taiwan Strait and the Korean Peninsula , as one of East Asia &apos;s three major flashpoints - is making waves again . 
China &apos;s announcement of a troop deployment to the Paracel Islands follows a month in which competing territorial claimants heightened their rhetoric , China &apos;s naval presence in disputed areas became more visible , and the Chinese divided the Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , whose foreign ministers could not agree on a communiqué for the first time in 45 years . 
All of this has jangled nerves - as did similar military posturing and diplomatic arm wrestling from 2009 to mid-2011 . 
Little wonder : stretching from Singapore to Taiwan , the South China Sea is the world &apos;s second-busiest sea-lane , with one-third of global shipping transiting through it . 
More neighboring states have more claims to more parts of the South China Sea - and tend to push those claims with more strident nationalism - than is the case with any comparable body of water . 
The legal and political issues associated with the competing territorial claims - and the marine and energy resources and navigation rights that go with them - are mind-bogglingly complex . 
Future historians may well be tempted to say of the South China Sea question what Lord Palmerston famously did of Schleswig-Holstein in the nineteenth century : &quot; Only three people have ever understood it . 
One is dead , one went mad , and the third is me - and I &apos;ve forgotten . &quot; 
The core territorial issue currently revolves around China &apos;s stated interest ­ - imprecisely demarcated on its 2009 &quot; nine-dashed line &quot; map - in almost the entire Sea . 
Such a claim would cover four disputed sets of land features : the Paracel Islands in the northwest , claimed by Vietnam as well ; the Macclesfield Bank and Scarborough Reef in the north , also claimed by the Philippines ; and the Spratly Islands in the south ( variously claimed by Vietnam , the Philippines , Malaysia , and Brunei , in some cases against each other as well as against China . ) 
There has been a scramble by the various claimants to occupy as many of these islands - some not much more than rocks - as possible . 
This is partly because , under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , which all of these countries have ratified , these outcroppings &quot; sovereign owners can claim a full 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone ( enabling sole exploitation of fisheries and oil resources ) if they can sustain an economic life of their own . 
Otherwise , sovereign owners can claim only 12 nautical miles of territorial waters . 
What has heightened ASEAN &apos;s concern about Beijing &apos;s intentions is that even if China could reasonably claim sovereignty over all of the land features in the South China Sea , and all of them were habitable , the Exclusive Economic Zones that went with them would not include anything like all of the waters within the dashed-line of its 2009 map . 
This has provoked fears , not unfounded , that China is not prepared to act within the constraints set by the Law of the Sea Convention , and is determined to make some broader history-based claim . 
A sensible way forward would begin with everyone staying calm about China &apos;s external provocations and internal nationalist drumbeating . 
There does not appear to be any alarmingly maximalist , monolithic position , embraced by the entire government and Communist Party , on which China is determined to steam ahead . 
Rather , according to an excellent report released in April by the International Crisis Group , its activities in the South China Sea over the last three years seem to have emerged from uncoordinated initiatives by various domestic actors , including local governments , law-enforcement agencies , state-owned energy companies , and the People &apos;s Liberation Army . 
China &apos;s ­ foreign ministry understands the international-law constraints better than most , without having done anything so far to impose them . 
China can and should lower the temperature by re-embracing the modest set of risk-reduction and confidence-building measures that it agreed with ASEAN in 2002 - and building upon them in a new , multilateral code of conduct . 
Only then can any credence be given to its stated position - not unattractive in principle - in favor of resource-sharing arrangements for disputed territory pending final resolution of competing claims . 
The US , for its part , while justified in joining the ASEAN claimants in pushing back against Chinese overreach in 2010-2011 , must be careful about escalating its rhetoric . 
America &apos;s military &quot; pivot &quot; to Asia has left Chinese sensitivities a little raw , and nationalist sentiment is more difficult to contain in a period of leadership transition . 
In any event , America &apos;s stated concern about freedom of navigation in these waters has always seemed a little overdrawn . 
One positive , and universally welcomed , step that the US could take would be finally to ratify the Law of the Sea Convention , whose principles must be the foundation for peaceful resource sharing - in the South China Sea as elsewhere . 
Demanding that others do as one says is never as productive as asking them to do as one does .
