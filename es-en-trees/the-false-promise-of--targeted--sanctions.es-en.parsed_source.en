The False Promise of &quot; Targeted &quot; Sanctions 
Despite his bellicose rhetoric , George W. Bush would very much like to avoid a choice between air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and accepting a nuclear Iran . 
For the moment , administration officials are hoping that &quot; targeted &quot; sanctions aimed directly at Iran &apos;s leadership will compel a compromise . 
The United Nations Security Council &apos;s recent decision to tighten existing sanctions on Iran by prohibiting dealings with 15 individuals and 13 organizations aims at precisely that . 
But , while some within the US government argue that similar sanctions induced North Korea to compromise on its nuclear program , there are several reasons why the same strategy is unlikely to work with Iran . 
First and foremost , targeted sanctions did not , in fact , really work with North Korea . 
The freeze on $ 25 million of the leadership &apos;s assets held at Banco Delta Asia in Macau has certainly irritated the North Koreans . 
But the asset freeze did not prevent Kim Jong-Il from ordering a ballistic missile test last July or an underground nuclear test in October . 
Instead , North Korea &apos;s willingness to resume negotiations partly reflects the Americans &quot; decision to stop insisting on the &quot; complete , verifiable , irreversible dismantlement &quot; of North Korea &apos;s nuclear program as a pre-condition for talks on normalizing relations . 
The Bush administration has accepted that North Korea is a nuclear power and that outsiders can do little about it , so the United States has shifted its diplomatic stance from the hard-line Japanese approach to the more flexible and stability-oriented Chinese position . 
That shift is understandable . 
Given its simultaneous military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan , together with North Korea &apos;s demonstrated nuclear capability , the Bush administration can &apos;t credibly threaten Kim with force . 
Sanctions have rattled the North Korean leadership , but not nearly enough to compel them to surrender fully the nuclear program , which is their ultimate guarantee of security . 
At the same time , the North Koreans &quot; willingness to make a deal also reflects China &apos;s decision to put its foot down . 
Exasperated by Kim &apos;s refusal to ease international tensions , Chinese officials have made clear their refusal to protect and subsidize North Korea &apos;s elite if it continues to push the US toward confrontation . 
The Chinese can &apos;t force Kim to disarm fully , but they can persuade him to negotiate with a now more flexible US . 
As a result , the US and North Korea have agreed a deal that differs from the Clinton-era &quot; Agreed Framework , &quot; mainly because North Korea now has a track record as both a deal breaker and a nuclear weapons state . 
Having returned to the bargaining table in a position of strength , North Korea now hopes to secure a compromise that frees up the leadership &apos;s assets and brings new benefits that help buttress the regime a little longer . 
As long as the Chinese talk tough and the US remains willing to negotiate , the agreement may hold . 
But neither diplomatic stance is likely to continue indefinitely . 
In any case , none of this will help the Bush administration with Iran . 
No outside actor has the leverage with Iran that China has with North Korea , and even if the US offered Iran a more conciliatory approach , the Democratic-led Congress isn &apos;t likely to follow suit . 
Buffeted by criticism that their position on the war in Iraq is incoherent and that they are soft on security threats , the Democrats appear determined to ratchet up pressure on Iran , favoring much broader sanctions than the Bush administration has proposed . 
For example , House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Lantos has introduced legislation that would extend the extra-territorial reach of US law to foreign governments &quot; export credit agencies , financial institutions , insurers , underwriters , and guarantors . 
It would also designate Iran &apos;s Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist group and impose further limits on exports to the country &apos;s civil aviation industry . 
Moreover , Republicans are getting in on the act . 
Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen has introduced legislation that would require US government pension funds , private pension funds , and mutual funds sold or distributed in the US to divest from companies that invest more than $ 20 million in Iran . 
Finally , just as Iran faces no China - an outside player with considerable domestic influence - North Korea faces no Israel , a neighbor that believes its security could depend on an act of military pre-emption . 
Israel does not want to take on Iran without US support and will maintain pressure on both Congress and the president to threaten Iran with every means at its disposal . 
The appeal of targeted sanctions against Iran is obvious : they are meant to help the administration avoid military action , which could create more problems than it solves . 
They are also much more likely to win international support than sanctions that would remove Iran &apos;s oil and gas supplies from the international marketplace . 
But the chances are slim that sanctions , whether targeted or otherwise , can undermine the consensus within Iran in favor of the nuclear program . 
As in North Korea , a nuclear capability constitutes a powerful symbol of the country &apos;s sovereignty and international clout - and would be the ultimate guarantee that America could never do there what it has done in Iraq . 
Sanctions give lawmakers and diplomats plenty to talk about . 
But unless a sea change occurs in Iranian domestic politics , they will merely postpone the difficult ( and increasingly likely ) choice between military action and accepting a nuclear Iran .
