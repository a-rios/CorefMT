Toward an Alliance of Hope 
WASHINGTON , DC - At World War II &apos;s close in the Pacific , we Japanese , with feelings of deep remorse , embarked on the path of rebuilding and renewing our country . 
Our predecessors &quot; actions brought great suffering to Asia &apos;s peoples , and we must never avert our eyes from that . 
I uphold the views expressed by Japan &apos;s previous prime ministers in this regard . 
Given this recognition and remorse , we Japanese have believed for decades that we must do all that we can to contribute to Asia &apos;s development . 
I am proud of the path that we have taken , but we did not walk that path alone . 
Seventy years ago , Japan had been reduced to ashes , and each and every month , citizens of the United States sent and brought gifts like milk for our children , warm sweaters , and even goats . 
Yes , 2,036 American goats came to Japan in the years right after the war . 
Former enemies had become close friends . 
And it was Japan that benefited earliest from the postwar international system that the US fostered by opening up its own market and calling for a liberal world economy . 
From the 1980s onward , we have seen the rise of the Republic of Korea , Taiwan , the ASEAN countries , and , before long , China - all taking the path of economic development enabled by the open world order created by the US . 
Japan , to be sure , did not stand idly by ; it poured in capital and technologies to support these countries &quot; growth . 
Both the US and Japan fostered prosperity - the seedbed for peace - in the region . 
Today , the US and Japan recognize that they must continue to take the lead in fostering a rules-based international economic order - fair , dynamic , and sustainable - within which all countries can flourish , free from the arbitrary intentions of any national government . 
In the world &apos;s great growth center , the Pacific market , we cannot overlook sweatshops or environmental burdens . 
Nor can we simply allow free riders to weaken intellectual property . 
Instead , we must spread and nurture our shared values : the rule of law , democracy , and freedom . 
That is exactly what the Trans-Pacific Partnership is all about . 
The TPP &apos;s strategic value extends far beyond the economic benefits it promises . 
As for US-Japan negotiations , the goal is near . 
Let us bring the TPP to a successful conclusion through our joint leadership . 
I know how difficult this path has been . 
Twenty years ago , I myself opposed opening Japan &apos;s agricultural market . 
But Japan &apos;s agriculture sector has declined over the last two decades . 
Our farmers &quot; average age has increased by ten years , to more than 66 . 
If our agriculture sector is to survive , we must follow through on sweeping reforms , including to our agricultural cooperatives , which have not changed in 60 years . 
Change is coming to Japanese business , too . 
Corporate governance in Japan is now fully in line with global standards because we made it stronger . 
And I am spearheading regulatory overhauls in such sectors as medicine and energy as well . 
Moreover , I am determined to do whatever it takes to reverse the decline in Japan &apos;s labor force . 
We are changing some of our old habits ; in particular , we are empowering women to become more actively engaged in all walks of life . 
In short , Japan is in the midst of a far-reaching transition to a more open future . 
We are determined to press ahead with the structural reforms needed to succeed . 
But reform requires the continuation of the peace and security that is the bequest of US leadership . 
My grandfather , Nobusuke Kishi , chose the path of democracy and alliance with the US when he was Prime Minister in the 1950s . 
Together with the US and other like-minded democracies , we won the Cold War . 
I intend to stick to that path ; indeed , there is no alternative to it . 
Our two countries need to make every effort to strengthen our ties . This is why I support America &apos;s strategic &quot; rebalancing &quot; to enhance peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region . 
Japan will support this effort first , last , and throughout . 
Japan is doing so by deepening its strategic relations with Australia and India , and we are enhancing our cooperation with the ASEAN countries and the Republic of Korea . 
Adding these partners to the central pillar of the US-Japan alliance will strengthen stability throughout the region . 
And now Japan will provide up to $ 2.8 billion dollars to help improve US bases on Guam , which will have even greater strategic significance in the future . 
Regarding Asia &apos;s ongoing maritime disputes , let me underscore my government &apos;s three principles . 
First , states must stake their territorial claims on the basis of international law . 
Second , they must not use force or coercion to press their claims . 
And , third , they must settle all disputes by peaceful means . 
We must make the vast seas stretching from the Pacific to the Indian Oceans a zone of peace and freedom , where all adhere to the rule of law . 
For this reason , too , it is our responsibility to fortify the US-Japan alliance . 
That is why we are working hard to enhance the legislative foundations of our security . 
These enhanced legislative foundations should make cooperation between the US military and Japan &apos;s Self-Defense Forces even stronger , and the alliance still more solid , providing credible deterrence in the service of peace in the region . 
Once these legal changes - the most sweeping in our post-war history - are in place by this summer , Japan will be better able to provide a seamless response for all levels of crisis . 
The new Defense Cooperation Guidelines between the US and Japan will serve the same purpose , and help secure peace in the region for years to come . 
Finally , Japan is ever more willing to bear its global responsibilities . 
In the early 1990s , Japan &apos;s Self-Defense Forces removed mines in the Persian Gulf . 
For ten years in the Indian Ocean , we supported US operations to stop the flow of terrorists and arms . 
In Cambodia , the Golan Heights , Iraq , Haiti , and South Sudan , members of our Self-Defense Forces provided humanitarian support and participated in peace-keeping operations . 
Some 50,000 service men and women have participated in those activities thus far . 
Japan &apos;s agenda is simple and straightforward : reform at home and proactive contributions to global peace based on the principle of international cooperation . 
It is an agenda that promises to lead Japan - and Asia - into a more stable and prosperous future .
