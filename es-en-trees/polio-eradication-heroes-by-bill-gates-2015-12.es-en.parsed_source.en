The Polio Heroes 
SEATTLE - The world &apos;s progress in fighting polio might be one of the best-kept secrets in global health . 
Indeed , my heroes for 2015 are the men and women on the front line in the fight against the disease . 
Since 1988 , the number of annual cases of polio worldwide has dropped more than 99.9 % . 
The disease used to paralyze an estimated 350,000 children every year ; in 2015 , the number of cases is likely to be fewer than 100 . 
Moreover , the year 2015 marked another important milestone in our mission to wipe out this debilitating scourge : For the first time in human history , Africa marked a year without any wild polio cases . 
Yet I &apos;m often surprised to hear how many people don &apos;t know about this mind-blowing progress . 
The credit goes to an international coalition of visionary people : the leaders who make polio eradication a high priority in their countries and the funders who underwrite the work of combating the disease . 
For example , support from the United Arab Emirates has been indispensable to vaccinating children in Pakistan - along with Afghanistan , the only two countries that have never been polio-free . 
But the stunning progress we &apos;ve seen over the last three decades would not be possible without the volunteers and frontline health workers who go out - sometimes at the risk of their own lives - to make sure every child is protected . 
Whether navigating floods , hiking up treacherous mountains , or working in some of the world &apos;s most conflict-ridden areas , 13 million children are alive and walking today because of these inspiring individuals . 
That &apos;s why I &apos;m proud that the Gates Foundation has created a partnership with the UAE to honor these courageous people through the Heroes of Polio Eradication ( HOPE ) Awards . 
The ceremony with His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan , Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi , was one of the most uplifting events on a trip I made recently to the Middle East . 
It was great to meet with the recipients and celebrate their amazing work . 
There is Freeda , a Lady Health Worker in Baluchistan , Pakistan , who has supported the polio eradication program for more than 15 years across often-dangerous parts of the province . 
Last year , Freeda was injured and a family member was killed in an attack during a vaccination drive . 
Atta Ullah is a community leader and activist in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Pakistan , who mobilizes support from local leaders and health workers for polio eradication activities . 
He also works to expose fallacies and debunk rumors about polio vaccines . 
I had already met the third recipient , Misbahu Lawan Didi , a couple of years ago in Nigeria . 
It was great to see him again and to see him recognized for his efforts . 
A polio survivor himself , Lawan Didi founded the Para-soccer game - an innovative program focused on building the self-reliance and self-confidence of 3,000 paraplegics . 
Then there was Constant Dedo , a polio consultant for the World Health Organization in Nigeria , who has worked for almost a decade across South Sudan , Pakistan , Nigeria , and Afghanistan . 
Constant &apos;s story is one of true dedication to polio eradication . 
While stationed in Pakistan , Constant was shot and required major surgery , but still continues with his work . 
Finally , we honored Bibi Malika , who is not only an important advocate for polio eradication , but also a community leader and a go-to source for medical wisdom in her hard-to-access community in Helmand , Afghanistan . 
She has been an inspiring example to other women in her area . 
All of these amazing individuals have my admiration and gratitude . 
Thanks to their efforts - and the endeavors of hundreds of thousands of people like them - we are achingly close to eradicating polio . 
Now we need to finish the job . 
I am optimistic that we will get there soon , through the diligence of those fighting the disease and the generosity of countries like the UAE that make their work possible .
