The Refugee Dilemma 
One reason Greek Cypriots rejected last April UN Secretary General Kofi Annan &apos;s plan for the reunification of Cyprus was that an overwhelming majority of them felt it did not do justice to the claims of refugees displaced during the 1974 Turkish invasion . 
This was also one of the few occasions when international public opinion became aware that there was a refugee problem on the island , because few people knew that refugees from that war still exist . 
When Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 after an abortive attempt by the Greek military junta in Athens to carry out Enosis ( unification with Greece ) , 250,000 or so Greek Cypriots were uprooted from their homes . 
Some fled in terror from the invading army , some were expelled - the usual complex , morally problematic picture that emerges in such situations . 
Although overwhelmed , the Greek Cypriot community reacted with humanity , solidarity , and prudence . 
Initially , refugees camps were set up , but the Greek Cypriot government decided that while it will not surrender the refugees &apos; claim eventually to return to their homes in the North , it would do its utmost in the interim not to leave them vegetating in squalid camps . 
No UN-sponsored refugee agency was established to help the refugees . 
Instead , with some international help , but mostly out of its own resources , the Republic of Cyprus - a small , then not very prosperous country that was devastated by war - launched a re-settlement and rehabilitation program as a national project . 
Government loans were offered for housing construction . 
In many cases , refugees built their own new homes . 
Businesses were encouraged with government subsidies and loans . 
Schools and training centers were established . 
Within a few years , the refugees were absorbed into the economy and society of the southern , Greek Cypriot sector of the island . 
As in post-World War II West Germany , much of the current prosperity in Cyprus today is an outcome of the boost the economy received from the absorption of refugees . 
Anyone visiting the Greek Cypriot part of the island nowadays will not find refugee camps : most of the millions of tourists are unaware of the fact that more than a third of the Greek Cypriots they encounter are refugees or descendants of refugees . 
The Greek Cypriot community can justly be proud of the way they handled the humanitarian and social problems of the refugees , without at any point surrendering their claims to the lands they lost . 
Equally commendable has been the Greek Cypriot strategic decision to follow a Gandhi-like policy of non-violence : while there is deep bitterness about the Turkish occupation , and the fact that Turkish settlers were implanted in the North , the Greek Cypriot community decided not to use violence against the occupation . 
Not one incident of Greek Cypriot terrorism or violence against Turkish occupation has occurred in more than a quarter of a century . 
This is also one of the reasons few people have ever heard about the Greek Cypriot refugees . 
It could , of course , be different : had Greek Cypriots followed the Palestinian example since 1948 - that is , kept the refugees in camps , segregated them from the non-refugee society , and fed their children a daily militaristic message of hatred , revenge , and terrorism - a completely different atmosphere would permeate the island . 
Recourse to violence and terror is a moral and strategic choice . 
The Greek Cypriots chose the path of non-violence ; the Palestinians chose the opposite route . 
There is always a choice , and there are always consequences . 
Consider what the Greek Cypriot community has achieved - a thriving economy , no one living under conditions of misery and humiliation in camps , membership in the European Union - compared to the catastrophe the Palestinian choice has brought to their own people . 
Perhaps on the level of public relations , the Palestinian leadership - sacrificing their own people on the altar of propaganda - can bask in their achievement : yet it is their own people who suffer . 
These leaders would do better to look across the Mediterranean at Cyprus and see how - without giving up claims to disputed land - refugees can live in dignity and honor . 
But then again , the Republic of Cyprus is a democracy , while the Palestinians have not been able to emancipate themselves from the violent militarized option that has brought them such misery .
