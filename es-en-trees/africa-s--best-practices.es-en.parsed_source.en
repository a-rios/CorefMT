Africa \ u0027s \ 
I visited Ghana recently and like many others left asking : how can a &quot; developing &quot; country be developed ? 
But there was something troubling about this formulation , in particular with the word &quot; developing , &quot; which is often a euphemism for the absence of economic development . 
Do countries stop developing because outsiders are so intent on developing them ? 
My hosts , the Kweku Hutchful Foundation , invited me with a different question in mind : How can Ghanaian leaders be developed ? 
Something troubled me about this formulation , too . 
It was that word &quot; development &quot; again . 
Do we really &quot; develop &quot; leaders or countries ? 
Do multinational companies , international non-governmental organizations , and multilateral lenders really understand local needs ? 
Just because some &quot; best practice &quot; works in New York , does that mean it will work in Accra , Ghana ? 
Imagine how American managers would react to consultants arriving from Ghana with their &quot; best practice &quot; : &quot; It worked in Accra , so it is bound to work in New York ! &quot; 
Of course , there is a prominent example of just that : Kofi Annan , under whose stewardship the UN has undergone a remarkable improvement . 
Annan spent most of his career outside of Ghana , and had some of his higher education in the US . 
Of course , Annan can hardly control the UN by imposing great strategies on everyone else , as American corporate CEOs do . 
But perhaps he knows better . 
So he knew what was wrong and appreciated that it had to be fixed carefully and patiently , by engaging the staff rather than intimidating them . 
His re-election to a second term as UN Secretary General was supported by nations all over the world , rich and poor , as well as by UN employees . 
Was Kofi Annan &quot; developed ? &quot; 
Perhaps we don &apos;t develop leaders so much as foster the conditions that bring out leadership . 
If so , then a key condition must be the self-respect that comes from working things out for ourselves , individually and collectively . 
This self-respect is fostered by organizations and institutions that can likewise stand on their own feet , building on the best of their own cultural traditions . 
Passive importation of techniques , controls , and beliefs , via agencies and experts that run around solving everyone else &apos;s problems , may be the biggest impediment to development - just another form of outside exploitation , of which Africa has had more than enough . 
Is it not time for indigenous development , of countries and leaders alike ? 
One thing is clear . 
Markets and personal initiative are pervasive . 
At a red light in New York , a squeegee kid or two might approach your car ; in Accra , a stopped car is immediately surrounded by a virtual supermarket . 
What Ghana and most of Africa lacks is not enterprise , but 
Instead , foreign corporations , with their funds , controls , and experts - and , just as importantly , their beliefs - dominate larger enterprise . 
To be sure , foreign corporations can do good things : bring in fresh ideas , techniques , and processes , as well as capital and the scale required in some contemporary forms of manufacturing . 
Development as now practiced often fails because it does not build on a country &apos;s unique strengths , respect its social traditions , or foster the autonomy necessary to develop indigenous leaders and enterprises . 
All too often , it is 
Pride , dignity , and self-confidence do not figure in economic theory : they cannot be measured . 
But they figure prominently in just about every story of success , whether of countries or of leaders . 
How people feel about themselves , personally and collectively , greatly influences the energy with which they develop themselves . 
America , for example , did not develop by depending on an imposed ideology or outside experts . 
It developed through the indigenous efforts of Americans acting in their own way - assisted by extensive state intervention , through land grants to farmers , railroads , and mining companies , military spending that stimulated the economy ( and still does ) , and , of course , tariff barriers . 
Likewise , indigenous development played a key role in Japan and Germany after WWII , in South Korea more recently , and the UK long before . 
In fact , has 
Globalization must not be allowed to blind us . 
Ghana certainly needs to develop economically , because material wealth is required to improve health , provide education , and sustain democracy . 
The ( economically ) developed West should consider importing that lesson .
