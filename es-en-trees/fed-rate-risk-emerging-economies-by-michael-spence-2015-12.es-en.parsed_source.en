The Fed &apos;s Risk to Emerging Economies 
MILAN - The US Federal Reserve has finally , after almost a decade of steadfast adherence to very low interest rates , hiked its federal funds rate - the rate from which all other interest rates in the economy take their cue - by 25 basis points . 
That brings the new rate up to a still-minimal 0.5 % , and Fed Chair Janet Yellen has wisely promised that any future increases will be gradual . 
Given the state of the US economy - real growth of 2 % , a tightening labor market , and little evidence of inflation rising toward the Fed &apos;s 2 % target - I view the rate rise as a reasonable and cautious first step toward normality ( defined as a better balance between borrowers and lenders ) . 
However , other central banks , particularly in economies where the output gap is larger than in the United States , will not be keen to follow the Fed &apos;s lead . 
On the face of it , a tiny change in the US rate should not trigger dramatic shifts in global capital flows . 
But , as US monetary policy follows the path of interest-rate normalization , there could well be knock-on effects , both economic and financial , especially in the form of currency volatility and destabilizing outflows from emerging economies . 
The reason we should fear this possibility is that the world &apos;s economic equilibrium is both fragile and unstable - and could wobble dangerously without determined and coordinated policy intervention . 
A Fed rate hike might not tip it over , but some other seemingly innocuous event could . 
One doesn &apos;t need a long memory to understand how even relatively modest policy shifts can trigger outsize market reactions . 
Consider , for example , the &quot; taper tantrum &quot; that roiled financial markets in the spring of 2013 , after then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke said only that policymakers were thinking of gradually ending quantitative easing . 
But that announcement came as a surprise ( as did the devaluation of China &apos;s renminbi this past summer ) . 
Capital that had flooded into emerging markets seeking yields no longer available in developed economies abruptly reversed course . 
No investor wanted to be the last one out . 
A jittery global financial system , like the one we have now , does not tolerate unwelcome surprises well . 
Unlike the taper tantrum and the devaluation of the renminbi , the Fed &apos;s rate-hike announcement on December 16 certainly was no surprise . 
So one might argue that if the Fed &apos;s move does lead to volatility in international capital flows , the process must have already started . 
In fact , near-universal anticipation of a US rate rise did not produce a spike in capital flows or asset prices . 
Yet widespread concerns persist . 
The International Monetary Fund for example , has argued that any rate hike by the Fed would need an &quot; effective monetary policy communication strategy &quot; - a polite way of saying that any monetary tightening in the US and other advanced economies would be premature . 
The reasoning is that emerging economies have become dangerously dependent on low interest rates and high commodity prices . 
Many emerging-market companies are in the highly vulnerable position of having borrowed heavily in foreign currencies . 
If capital flight occurs , the consequences will be dire : tightened credit , balance-of-payments difficulties , inflation , rising interest rates , fiscal stress , and downgrades by the major credit-rating agencies - all of which implies more capital flight . 
Europeans , too , have become dependent on low interest rates , with the European Central Bank as the key stabilizing force . 
Without the ECB &apos;s commitment , in place since 2012 , to prevent sovereign-debt yields from soaring , there would be a persistent risk to the eurozone - and , indeed , to the entire edifice of the European Union - of sovereign-debt defaults . 
But at least Europe has benefited from falling commodity prices . 
By contrast , many emerging economies , highly dependent on commodity export earnings , have been stressed by the commodity-price reset , sluggish growth in developed economies , and slower growth in China . 
Capital flight would materially add to their plight - in some cases disastrously so . 
Since the 2008 financial crisis , the world has become accustomed to such linkages and spillovers . 
And yet policy responses to crises remain decentralized . 
They cannot be confident of appropriate reactions by their policymakers to rapid capital outflows , or of their capacity in terms of policy tools , reserves , and balance sheets . 
And they cannot be fully certain of the speed and effectiveness of the international policy responses that might otherwise act as &quot; circuit breakers . &quot; 
The reality is that emerging markets that benefited after the 2008 crisis from China &apos;s economic growth , rising commodity prices , and cheap foreign capital must now adjust to reversals in all of these factors . 
The necessary transitions for these markets will be complex , risky , and not entirely within their control . 
While the Fed &apos;s rate hike , prudently accompanied by an emphasis on small and gradual steps , may not turn out to be a trigger , the concerns about the knock-on effects are legitimate . 
It would be unwise to assume that , with the initial hike now behind us , systemic risk has somehow disappeared . 
In the long run , of course , emerging markets will benefit from interest-rate normalization , because they will no longer suffer the distortions and imbalances that lead to unsustainable growth patterns . 
But the hard part will be getting from here to there without an accident .
