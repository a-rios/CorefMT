Cuba &apos;s Back 
MEXICO CITY - After 47 years , the Organization of American States , at its annual General Assembly , has repealed its suspension of Cuba &apos;s membership . 
The so-called ALBA countries ( the Spanish acronym for the so-called Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas ) , which includes Cuba , Venezuela , Honduras , Nicaragua , Bolivia , Dominica , and Ecuador , were able partly to outwit - and partly to &quot; out-blackmail &quot; - Canada , the United States , and the Latin American democracies in getting Cuba rehabilitated . 
The OAS did , however , lay down two conditions . 
Cuba must explicitly request reinstatement , and a dialogue must be initiated in accordance with the premises of the OAS Charter and other basic OAS documents , and in consonance with the principles on which those documents are based - most importantly , democracy and respect for human rights . 
Like many diplomatic compromises , the outcome left everyone a bit happy and a bit disappointed . 
Everyone could claim victory , and no one was obliged to acknowledge defeat . 
But those compromises are like statistics or skimpy swimsuits : what they show is less important than what they hide . 
Two fundamental considerations come to mind , and their ramifications in &quot; up-for-grab &quot; countries in Latin America , such as El Salvador , are particularly significant . 
The first consideration involves the ALBA countries &quot; conduct of foreign policy . 
Given that the smaller countries do not act independently of Venezuela , and that Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez does not act without Cuba &apos;s guidance on weighty matters such as these , it is now clear that the Cubans and their allies will cut US President Barack Obama no slack on Latin American issues . 
They could have easily let the OAS assembly go by , giving the new American president more time to prepare his Congress and public opinion for a delicate balancing act . 
The key issue here is how to lift the now almost fifty-year old US embargo on trade , investment , and travel to Cuba unilaterally , while portraying it as the result of a negotiation . 
The ALBA countries decided they would concede nothing to Obama , and attempt , instead , to back him into a corner : either the US would go along with the new OAS consensus , angering both parts of the Cuban-American lobby and the human rights community by abandoning principles and commitments , or the US would have to act alone ( perhaps with Canada by its side ) , leaving it totally isolated in Latin America - the last thing Obama wants . 
The ALBA group pushed hard for a vote , or a compromise on its terms , which it could then flaunt to the world and to domestic public opinion . 
Obama had no choice but to go along . 
The second consideration is that this behavior will continue . 
The reason seems clear enough : Cuba needs international aid desperately , and there are not too many places where it can find it . 
Hopes that Brazil and China would provide cash to Cuba have been dashed by the international financial crisis and geo-politics . 
And Chávez , despite the recent increase in oil prices , can no longer afford to subsidize Cuba as he did during the boom years . 
So it seems that the Cubans are hoping to find resources elsewhere , and the only possibility , as remote as it seems , is the Inter-American Development Bank . 
In principle , IDB membership requires OAS membership , and therein may lie the reason why Cuba insisted so strongly on returning , and why it was ultimately disappointed in not obtaining unconditional re-admission . 
It will nonetheless attempt to have its allies push for some sort of association with the IDB , while at the same time radicalizing its stance elsewhere , as it is now doing in El Salvador . 
Indeed , the new Salvadoran president , Mauricio Funes , was elected on the ticket of the FMLN , the party that succeeded the old , hard-left guerrilla group of the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . 
He is a moderate , modern leftist who has openly identified himself with Brazilian President Lula and Barack Obama , as opposed to Chávez . 
But his party is as close to Cuba and Venezuela as one can get . 
In a showdown over the composition of the cabinet just before his inauguration on June 1 , the FMLN old guard won , threatening to take the conflict to the streets . 
The Cubans , Nicaraguans , and Venezuelans will not cut Funes any slack , either , believing that history is on their side , and that now is the time to force every issue in sight . 
They are probably right , up to a certain point , because the second lesson from the OAS assembly concerns the behavior of the Latin American democracies , mainly Mexico , Brazil , Chile , and Colombia . 
They tried to accommodate the US ( it is rumored that Obama phoned Lula and asked for his help ) , but were nonetheless unwilling to break with Cuba and Venezuela to side openly with the US . 
They will not do so any time soon , on any issue that may spring up , if it means confrontation with the ALBA countries . 
Fidel Castro knows this , and will take advantage of the democracies &quot; diluted commitment to human rights and democracy . 
In each country where conflict is present or emerging ( Bolivia , Guatemala , El Salvador , Paraguay , and Ecuador ) the hard-left will push hard , the democracies will look the other way , and Obama will either give in ( as at the OAS ) and pay a domestic political price , or step back from Latin America , for fear of appearing isolated . 
A magnificent opportunity for a new start in US-Latin American relations will have been missed .
