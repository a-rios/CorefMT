The War On Terrorism After Iraq 
Dazzling military victories in Afghanistan and Iraq may mislead us about the war on terrorism . 
If it were merely a matter of rogue states , we could think that progress is being made . 
But technological progress is putting into the hands of deviant groups and individuals destructive capabilities that were once limited primarily to governments and armies . 
Even if eliminating all terrorist incidents proves impossible , reducing their frequency and lethal potential will make a large difference in their impact on our societies . 
The world needs a multi-faceted strategy that de-legitimizes attacks on civilians as a method of conflict ; discourages states from providing resources or safe harbor to those who use such methods ; hardens our targets at home ; denies terrorists easy access to weapons of mass destruction ; and reduces incentives to use terrorism . 
Military measures may not deal with the largest part of the problem , but they are essential sometimes . 
Depriving Al Qaeda of its Afghan safe haven was not sufficient , but it was necessary . 
The number of states sponsoring terrorism has decreased over the past decade . 
Diplomacy backed by military threat can reduce the number further . 
Some failed states are so chaotically organized that they cannot be deterred from providing a haven for terrorists . 
In such instances , military assistance may be relevant ; in others , intervention may be necessary . 
Intelligence sharing and police cooperation is often the most effective front line of defense . 
Because of the sensitivity of sources and the dangers of disclosure , much of this work is carried out through bilateral arrangements . 
Multilateral cooperation is possible in tracing financial flows , which can help to deprive terrorists of resources as well as provide useful information . 
Information sharing can also be enhanced by devoting more resources to under-funded organizations like Interpol . 
Working to raise the thresholds that terrorists must overcome requires a systemic approach , since plugging one hole can simply divert terrorists to others . 
Our societies are as vulnerable as the weakest international link . 
It makes no sense to beef up airport security in London if a terrorist can enter the system easily in , say , Rome or Lagos . 
Because modern societies are similar in their vulnerabilities , countries have a great deal to learn from each others &apos; mistakes and best practices . 
Governments should establish regular contacts among agencies responsible for both the technical and policy dimensions of homeland security . 
Homeland security is an international issue . 
Aid and assistance can be used to strengthen the capacities of poor countries involved in these transnational systems . 
Such investments are a clear case of coincidence between self-interest and charity . 
A particularly important type of assistance is in helping other countries to develop capabilities to deal with weapons of mass destruction . 
In the case of biological agents , world public health has become a security issue . 
Terrorists can obtain microbes and viruses from inadequately protected foreign laboratories , or by bribing underpaid scientists in the remnants of the Russian biological warfare system , or from natural sources . 
The World Health Organization has created a global network of national laboratories that do early detection work , and manages on a meager annual budget of roughly $ 400 million . 
Another crucial area for assistance is the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort , which provides funds to help improve the control and destruction of weapons-grade materials in former Soviet countries . 
These programs , too , are under-funded , although there was an agreement in principle at the G-8 summit in Canada last year for ten countries to provide an additional $ 10 billion over the next ten years . 
Somewhat more controversial is the question of whether aid to development is an important counter-terrorist instrument . 
Advocates say that it is a crucial tool for &quot; draining the swamps . &quot; 
But skeptics challenge whether poverty lies at the root of terrorism . 
They point out that most of the terrorists who attacked America in September 2001 were middle-class citizens of a relatively wealthy country . 
If we must wait for development assistance to raise the world from poverty as the answer to terrorism , we will all be dead . 
Both sides of this argument have a point . 
The time horizons of development policy are out of line with the time horizons of counter-terrorism , but terrorist groups are often led by well-off deviants who ( like Osama bin Laden ) recruit followers by pointing out the world &apos;s injustices . 
Development assistance by wealthy countries can help deprive terrorist leaders of such arguments by showing that policies are aligned with the long term aspirations of the poor . 
It is important to provide the prospect of hope , both in material terms and in our policies towards intractable conflicts such as those in the Middle East and Kashmir . 
US military success in Iraq was dazzling , but the metaphor of war is misleading . 
There will be no equivalent to the fall of Baghdad , and no silver bullet in the struggle against terrorism . 
Success will require investment in a wide range of instruments . 
Yet , while the US spends only about 1 % of its federal budget on foreign affairs , an effective counter-terrorism strategy cannot be divorced from all the dimensions of foreign policy .
