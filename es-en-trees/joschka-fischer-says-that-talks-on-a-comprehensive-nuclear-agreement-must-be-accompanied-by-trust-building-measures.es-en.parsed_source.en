Defusing Iran 
BERLIN - On February 18 , crucial negotiations over Iran &apos;s nuclear program began in Vienna between Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany ( the P5 + 1 ) . 
The alternative to the talks is a further nuclear buildup by Iran , followed by additional international sanctions and , eventually , another war in the Middle East , which no one believes can resolve the problem . 
So , can a comprehensive agreement that respects Iran &apos;s right to civilian nuclear energy , while allaying the international community &apos;s fears of weaponization , be achieved ? 
The interim agreement reached last November in Geneva reflected the West &apos;s de facto acceptance that Iran is entitled to carry out limited low-grade uranium enrichment within the framework of the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) . 
The West released about $ 7 billion of frozen Iranian funds and relaxed some sanctions ( in particular , on crude oil and auto parts ) , while Iran agreed to a quasi-freeze of its nuclear program . 
First and foremost , a mountain of mutual distrust will need to be overcome . 
The West and Israel do not believe that Iran &apos;s nuclear program is meant to serve merely civilian aims . 
Otherwise , why would Iran invest billions of dollars in a program that is almost tailor-made for military purposes , including long-distance delivery systems ? 
The Iranian leadership , for its part , remains convinced that the United States still seeks to bring about regime change . 
From Iran &apos;s perspective , accepting an American hand extended in a spirit of conciliation could turn it into a fist . 
Moreover , any compromise would be fiercely contested within both camps , possibly leading to serious domestic political conflict . 
And even if both sides &quot; current leaderships are sincere , will this hold true for their successors ? 
The absence of trust between Iran and the West leads directly to the second obstacle to a comprehensive agreement : verification and monitoring . 
The central issue in these negotiations , around which everything else revolves , concerns Iran &apos;s &quot; breakout capability &quot; - the time it would need , within the framework of any agreement with the West , to renege and build a nuclear weapon . 
How much supervision will be required not just to verify compliance but also to detect any possible attempt at a breakout ? 
The technical questions are complex , and the proverbial devil really is in the countless details . 
The first two issues reflect the two paths toward the bomb : uranium enrichment and plutonium production . 
Any workable agreement will require Iran to renounce uranium enrichment above the 5 % level needed for a civilian nuclear-power program ; accept limits on enrichment volumes , the number of centrifuges , and technology ; agree to forgo reprocessing ; and address operations at the heavy-water reactor in Arak . 
The third issue concerns supervision and monitoring , which for quite some time would probably have to go beyond that agreed in the Additional Protocol to the NPT and include certain military installations . 
Indeed , the duration the agreement will be of vital importance . 
The West wants it to be implemented for as long as possible , while Iran would prefer a very short timeframe within which to achieve its central objectives : a comprehensive and lasting repeal of international sanctions and recognition as an NPT non-military nuclear power . 
That raises another important question : Does US President Barack Obama really have a domestic mandate for negotiating a comprehensive repeal of the sanctions ? 
Here , we are brought back to the central issue in this process : technical questions , though important , are still only an expression of the underlying political conflicts and animosities . 
These are the real factors driving the confrontation that the Vienna negotiations are meant to defuse over the next six months . 
And the current regional and sectarian confrontation in the Middle East affects the nuclear negotiations directly . 
All of the relevant players - including those , like Saudi Arabia and Israel , that are not sitting at the table but whose presence is very much felt - are clinging to their initial positions . 
The US does not want Iran to become a military nuclear power or gain regional predominance ; above all , the Americans do not want another Middle East war . 
Iran , however , wants to become a ( non-military ? ) nuclear power and shape a region in which it is heavily involved militarily ( in Syria , Lebanon , and Iraq ) . 
Europe shares the US position , but is more flexible . 
Saudi Arabia , a Sunni power , wants to stop Shia Iran from becoming an emerging or , worse still , a military nuclear power in the Gulf , and has taken the opposite side in Syria , Lebanon , and Iraq . 
Israel opposes Iran &apos;s becoming a military nuclear power - or even a nuclear-threshold state - and is willing to try to prevent this by military means . 
To achieve a sustainable compromise that all sides accept ( even if with gritted teeth ) , the negotiations must be accompanied by diplomatic steps aimed at building trust both in the region and beyond . 
Europe is very well versed in such processes and should put its experience to good use . 
Iran must decide whether it wants to follow the North Korean route to international isolation , or some variation on the Chinese route to integration into the global economy . 
It must also understand that its relationship with both Israel and Saudi Arabia will affect the negotiations , either positive or negatively . 
And the West - the US , Europe , and , more than any other country , Israel - will have to get used to the idea of living with an Iranian civilian nuclear-power program , while limiting Iran &apos;s capacity to become an emerging military nuclear power . 
As the very different examples of the Soviet Union and China show , the Iranian regime might someday collapse or change fundamentally - probably when hardly anyone expects it . 
Until then , we must do our best to defuse the nuclear time bomb together .
