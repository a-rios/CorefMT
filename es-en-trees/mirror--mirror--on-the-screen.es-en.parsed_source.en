Mirror , Mirror , on the Screen 
NEW YORK - Suppose a group of workers frequently communicate among themselves , and then suddenly one of them gets left off all the &quot; copy-tos . &quot; &quot; It could be that they &apos;re planning a surprise birthday party , &quot; says Elizabeth Charnock , whose company , Cataphora , analyzes e-mail traffic and content as well as other documents , primarily for clients involved in litigation and crime detection . 
&quot; It &apos;s more likely that they &apos;re planning to engage in fraud and they know this one person won &apos;t go along with it . &quot; 
&quot; All abnormal behavior may not be bad , &quot; says Charnock , &quot; but virtually all really bad behavior is abnormal . 
From years of analyzing the abnormal , I &apos;ve developed a keen appreciation for the myriad peccadilloes that are quite normal : the dull co-worker whom others scheme to avoid , the eleventh-hour passing of the buck , the ex you promised to &quot; stay friends &quot; with but never wrote to again , the small but telling things that really get under your skin . &quot; 
Now she , and Cataphora , are applying those same analytics to a different market : people who want to analyze their own e-mail correspondence ( and eventually other content ) to see a reflection of their interactions with others . 
Call it a visualization of your social graph in action . 
With Cataphora &apos;s new software tool called Digital Mirror , you can see the top asymmetries in your own relationships : whom you respond to before others versus whom you postpone , reschedule , or otherwise delay - and who does the same to you . 
To the extent that you are cc &apos;ed , you can also see patterns among your friends or colleagues : Which topics provoke huge amounts of stress or argument ? 
Which are dismissed with little comment ? 
The software works by analyzing not just the &quot; shape &quot; of a conversation - who writes to whom , who answers , and when - but also the content . 
What are the key words ? 
And what - judging by everything from words such as &quot; must &quot; or &quot; immediately &quot; to slang or profanity , to &quot; softeners &quot; such as &quot; if you don &apos;t mind &quot; and &quot; please , &quot; and text written in ALL CAPS - is the tone ? 
Obviously , some cultures have their own jargon and tone , so Digital Mirror looks at the relative as well as absolute frequency of the values that it measures . 
Is Juan obsequiously polite to Alice , but abrupt to Marvin ? 
Does he respond promptly to Teresa , but ignore Anatoly ? 
The sofware offers nine visualizations that reflect behavior and trends over time , including quality time ( a pie chart of whom you spend time with online and offline ) , pecking order ( illustrated with chickens ! ) , blow-off scorecard ( relationship asymmetry ) , and temperature gauge . 
The result is a startlingly clear look at what is going on in a circle of people : who defers to whom , who takes charge , who passes the buck . 
Digital Mirror - along with a book written by Charnock called E-Habits , which serves as a kind of extended documentation - can be used for self-analysis or analysis of the local ecosystem . 
The program is targeted at individuals , but a company systems administrator or human-resources manager could use it to identify company- or group-wide patterns - though to do so without informing employees that their mail is being monitored would be illegal in Europe and bad practice at best in the United States . 
Of course , transparency is unsettling - whether it &apos;s seeing your own wrinkles in the mirror , or confirming unpleasant aspects of how others treat you . 
Transparency is unambiguously good for companies and for governments ; by and large they don &apos;t welcome it , but it makes them more accountable to their constituents and to society . 
Personal transparency and accountability , on the other hand , are harder , owing both to a lack of visibility and to people &apos;s reluctance to confront one another - or themselves . 
Once you see your own digital reflection , will you improve your behavior ? 
( Surely you are not already perfect ? ) 
Though personal transparency is uncomfortable , wouldn &apos;t you rather answer to a piece of software than confront your friends &quot; candor face-to-face ? 
Conversely , if someone at work is bothering you , you don &apos;t need to tell them directly ; you can just e-mail them a link to Digital Mirror ( just like the old trick of dropping a can of deodorant on a co-worker &apos;s desk - difficult but sometimes necessary ) . 
Indeed , I suspect that the people who need Digital Mirror the most are the ones who will recognize that need the least . 
Still , it may help the semi-self-aware to improve their personal relations - or at least to be more aware of the trade-offs they make when they favor one friend or colleague over another . 
According to Charnock , &quot; People believe that the digital world largely masks their preferences for different individuals . 
For example , in a real-world office , you can see who goes out to lunch together or gossips at the water cooler , who has a line in front of their door , and so on . 
Not only are many of the equivalent online activities harder to see or quantify , but things like Facebook encourage you to &quot; friend &quot; everyone .... Everyone is more popular , more intelligent , and better looking than average . 
Digital Mirror does the reverse . 
It is like the difference between a bar or club where the lights are low , and a good make-up mirror . &quot; 
This all reflects a trend toward greater clarity in our relations . 
Facebook and other social tools operate under the covers : Facebook notices which friends you interact with and whose photos you comment on in order to select the items in your NewsFeed or the ads you see . 
But Facebook does not show that information to you . 
Digital Mirror does . 
Within a few years , this kind of transparency will probably be commonplace , both from Facebook and from ad networks and behavioral targeters trying to derive information about your likely purchases . 
But right now , only Digital Mirror is one of the few to give you the ability to do the same for yourself .
