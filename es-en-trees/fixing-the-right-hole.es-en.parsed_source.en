Fixing the Right Hole 
LONDON - The &quot; laws of holes &quot; are as unforgiving as the laws of physics . If you find yourself in a hole and want to get out , the first thing you do is to stop digging . 
If you confront a number of holes to fix and want to know which to fix first , you choose the one which poses the greater danger . 
These laws are particularly true when applied to government finance . 
When John Maynard Keynes talked of persistent under-employment , he did not mean that , following a big shock , economies stay frozen at one unchanging level of depressed activity . 
But he did think that , without external stimulus , recovery from the lowest point would be slow , uncertain , weak , and liable to relapse . 
His &quot; under-employment equilibrium &quot; is a form of gravitational pull rather than a fixed condition . 
This is a situation that Alan Greenspan , the former chairman of the United States Federal Reserve , described as a &quot; quasi-recession , &quot; a better term than &quot; double-dip recession . &quot; 
It denotes an anemic recovery , with bursts of excitement punctuated by collapses . 
It is the situation we confront today . 
Contrary to Keynes , orthodox economists believe that , after a big shock , economies will &quot; naturally &quot; return to their previous rate of growth , provided that governments balance their budgets and stop stealing resources from the private sector . The theory underlying this way of thinking was set out in the July Bulletin of the European Central Bank . 
Debt-financed public spending , the ECB argued , will &quot; crowd out &quot; private spending by causing real interest rates to rise or by leading households to increase their saving because they expect to pay higher taxes later . 
Either way , a fiscal stimulus will not only have no effect ; the economy will be worse off , because public spending is inherently less efficient than private spending . 
The Bulletin &apos;s authors do not believe that a &quot; crowding out &quot; of this type actually happened over the last two years . 
On the contrary , as they explain , if there are unemployed resources , extra government spending can &quot; crowd in &quot; private spending by creating additional demand that would otherwise not exist . 
Summarizing the evidence , the Bulletin finds that fiscal-stimulus programs in the eurozone have caused GDP to be 1.3 % higher in 2009-2010 than it otherwise would have been . 
Evidence for the positive impact of fiscal stimulus is even stronger in the US . 
In a recent paper , the economists Alan Blinder and Mark Zandl found that the total stimulus policy adopted in 2009-2010 ( including TARP , the much-maligned financial-sector bailout scheme ) averted another Great Depression . 
Fiscal expansion alone caused GDP in the US to be 3.4 % higher over 2009-2010 than it otherwise would have been . 
Yet the budget cutters have a fallback position . 
The problem with fiscal stimulus , they say , is that it destroys confidence in government finances , thereby impeding recovery . 
So a credible deficit-reduction program is needed now to &quot; consolidate recovery . &quot; 
What is it about cutting the deficit that is supposed to restore confidence ? 
This will have a positive wealth effect and increase private consumption . 
But why on earth should consumers believe that cutting a deficit , and raising taxes now , will lead to tax cuts later ? One implausible hypothesis follows another . 
But it is unemployment , loss of skills and self-confidence , and investment rationing that are hitting the supply side . 
This will reduce real interest rates and make &quot; crowding in &quot; of private spending more likely . 
But real interest rates on long-term government debt in the US , Japan , Germany , and the United Kingdom are already close to zero . 
Not only do investors view the risks of depression and deflation as greater than those of default , but bonds are being preferred to equities for the same reason . Finally , the reduction of governments &quot; borrowing requirements &quot; might &quot; have a beneficial effect on output in the long run , owing to lower long-term interest rates . 
Of course , low long-term interest rates are necessary for recovery . 
No matter how cheap it is for businessmen to borrow , they will not do so if they see no demand for their products . 
The ECB &apos;s arguments look to me like scraping the bottom of the intellectual barrel . 
The truth is that it is not fear of government bankruptcy , but governments &quot; determination to balance the books , that is reducing business confidence by lowering expectations of employment , incomes , and orders . 
The problem is not the hole in the budget ; it is the hole in the economy . 
Let us assume , though , that the ECB is right and that fears of &quot; unsound finance &quot; are holding back economic recovery . 
The question still needs to be asked : are such fears rational ? 
Are they not exaggerated in today &apos;s circumstances ( except , possibly , in countries like Greece ) ? 
If so , is it not the duty of official bodies like the ECB to challenge irrational beliefs about the economy , rather than pander to them ? 
The trouble is that the current crisis finds governments intellectually disabled , because their theory of the economy is a mess . 
Events and common sense drove them to deficit finance in 2009-2010 , but they have not abandoned the theory that depressions cannot happen , and that deficits are therefore always harmful ( except in war ! ) . 
So now they vie with each other in their haste to cut off the lifeline that they themselves extended . 
Policymakers need to re-learn their Keynes , explain him clearly , and apply his lessons , not invent pseudo-rational arguments for prolonging the recession .
