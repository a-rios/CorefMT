Chinese Coal Cuts 
HONG KONG - In the fight to limit global warming , no country matters more than China - a massive coal-dependent country , which is responsible for 30 % of global carbon-dioxide emissions . 
Fortunately , it is moving to improve its environmental record . 
But is it doing enough ? 
If China could pursue only one goal , it should be cutting its reliance on coal energy . 
The country is home to one-sixth of the world &apos;s people , yet it accounts for almost one-half of global coal consumption . 
If China does not reduce that share and cut its greenhouse-gas emissions , keeping global warming in check will prove impossible . 
The good news is that coal use in China seems to have fallen slightly last year - a trend that is expected to continue . 
The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis estimates that the share of coal-generated electricity in China will decline from 72.5 % in 2014 to 60 % in 2020 . 
While last year &apos;s drop in coal use may have been a technical blip , Chinese coal consumption is expected to peak very soon - probably next year . 
That means that CO2 emissions - the largest component of the greenhouse-gas emissions that cause global warming - will begin falling , too , enabling China to fulfill its pledge , made last November as part of a landmark climate agreement with the United States , that emissions would peak around 2030 . 
In fact , if China &apos;s leaders act boldly , the peak could be reached even sooner , in the early 2020s . 
As China &apos;s coal use begins to fall , its renewables sector is growing rapidly . 
Last year , China spent a massive $ 90 billion on renewable energy - far more than the $ 52 billion invested by the second-largest spender , the US . 
China now has the world &apos;s largest installed base of wind power , and its solar power capacity is second only to Germany &apos;s . 
From humble beginnings at the turn of the century , Chinese wind and solar companies have grown into some of the world &apos;s largest and most efficient . 
The government &apos;s efforts to promote renewables are driven partly by growing pressure from middle-class Chinese , who are increasingly frustrated with pollution levels . 
Indeed , the environment is a hot topic in China today , exemplified by the response to the documentary film &quot; Under the Dome , &quot; which takes a critical look at air pollution and the role of the country &apos;s coal and petrochemical companies . 
More than 300 million Chinese saw the film after its late-February release , which was timed to coincide with the annual meeting of China &apos;s National People &apos;s Congress in early March . 
The 103-minute production , by the prominent journalist Chai Jing , highlights the health risks posed by the thick smog shrouding China &apos;s most productive cities . 
The film begins with the story of Chai &apos;s own newborn daughter being diagnosed with a benign tumor . 
Though Chai never directly links her daughter &apos;s tumor to air pollution , &quot; Under the Dome &quot; delivers a compelling message . 
The public reaction was overwhelming . 
Despite - or perhaps because of - this response , &quot; Under the Dome &quot; and related commentary have been removed from China &apos;s media . 
But , though the government may not want not to draw attention to its pollution problem , it certainly is trying to address it . 
Its investments have already helped to lower global prices of renewables . 
Researchers at Harvard University and Tsinghua University say that wind power could , in theory , produce all of China &apos;s electricity for the price of coal by 2030 . 
Still , China should be acting even more aggressively . 
The authorities should focus not only on producing renewable energy , but also on improving the energy efficiency of existing systems . 
As it stands , China &apos;s economy is about three times as energy-intensive as America &apos;s ( a country that is not particularly energy-efficient itself ) . 
As renewable energy becomes increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels and energy consumption becomes more efficient , China will become better able to reduce emissions without undermining economic growth . 
According to a recent study by the Tsinghua / MIT China Energy 
Such an outcome would bolster global emission-reduction efforts considerably . 
In fact , new data from the International Energy Agency show that , in 2014 , global CO2 emissions did not rise , suggesting that efforts to mitigate climate change may already be having a more significant effect than previously thought . 
This is particularly notable because the recent pause in emissions growth , unlike the other three that have occurred in the last 40 years , occurred amid economic expansion at a respectable annual rate of 3 % . 
As greenhouse-gas emissions become decoupled from economic growth , the world &apos;s chances of successfully mitigating climate change become much higher . 
As IEA Chief Economist ( and future Executive Director ) Fatih Birol put it , this development &quot; provides much-needed momentum to negotiators preparing to forge a global climate deal in Paris in December . &quot; 
China still has a long way to go .
