Is Evidence-Based Medicine Broken ? 
LONDON - Evidence-based medicine , as David Sackett and his colleagues wrote in 1996 , is &quot; the conscientious , explicit , and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients . &quot; 
At first glance , this seems entirely logical ; indeed , many would say that this simply could be called &quot; medicine . &quot; 
But the approach is generating considerable controversy , with many asserting that it is &quot; broken . &quot; 
Last month , when the British Medical Journal asked its readers whether evidence-based medicine is malfunctioning , the responses were almost evenly split : 51 % answered positively , and 49 % negatively . 
The controversy stems from the kind of evidence that is used . 
Sackett implies , but does not stipulate , that epidemiological evidence ( findings from randomized controlled trials and large-cohort studies carried out over many years ) should underpin doctors &quot; decisions about patients - and , one hopes , in consultation with them . 
Epidemiological research studies address questions like , &quot; If 1,000 people with type 2 diabetes were randomly allocated to four groups of 250 people that each received either no treatment ( or a placebo ) , drug A , drug B , or drug C for ten years , how would it impact survival rates , and what , if any , complications and side effects would there be ? &quot; 
If the trial is conducted properly - it is large enough ; people are allocated in a truly random way ; and &quot; blind &quot; assessments of the outcomes are conducted - the results should be reliable . 
Consider the following scenario : Ten-year survival rates for the four groups are 70 % , 71 % , 80 % , and 82 % , respectively , and the proportion of people developing troublesome side effects is 1 % , 2 % , 5 % , and 50 % . 
Most people trade a small reduction in the chance of survival for a large reduction in the chance of adverse effects ; in other words , they would opt for drug B. 
In short , evidence-based medicine uses the science of epidemiology to create a clear and structured set of decisions about tests and treatments for individual patients , with the evidence often - and increasingly - being summarized in the form of clinical guidelines . 
This is problematic for two main reasons . 
For starters , the emphasis on randomized controlled trials as the &quot; gold standard &quot; of evidence has meant that any drug that has outperformed a competitor in a trial may now be classified as &quot; evidence-based . &quot; 
Look no further than the glossy ads in medical journals to discover drugs you did not know you needed for diseases that you never knew existed , such as &quot; female sexual arousal disorder &quot; and &quot; adult attention deficit disorder . &quot; 
And how many drugs are tested against more natural non-drug therapies - yoga for high blood pressure , for example , or brisk walking for diabetes - before being licensed ? 
In a sense , evidence-based medicine has been a victim of its own success , having fueled an exponential increase in research trials in the 20 years since it began . 
One does not need a PhD in cognitive psychology to recognize that overloading doctors working in a high-stress , time-constrained environment with a mass of guidelines and research results will lead to errors . 
And the attempted solution - hard-wiring the guidelines into computerized &quot; decision support tools &quot; - has been largely a flop , given computer models &quot; inability to accommodate messy , real-world clinical practice . 
For example , generations of medical students have memorized the textbook features of celiac disease for their examinations . 
But your Aunt Nora &apos;s celiac disease has not read the textbook . 
Indeed , only Aunt Nora can tell you how her celiac disease behaves . 
She also happens to be opposed to taking blue-colored pills . 
The computer model &apos;s treatment recommendations would probably not work for Aunt Nora . 
But this does not mean that evidence-based medicine is broken ; it simply lacks the needed maturity . 
High-quality randomized trials are as important now as they were at the time of the evidence-based movement &apos;s founding . 
But the system must be shaped by the doctor &apos;s judgment and the patient &apos;s individual experience . 
It is time to stop overloading doctors with evidence and deploying fast-talking industry salespeople to manipulate them with clever marketing pitches . 
Instead , researchers must optimize the presentation , summarization , processing , and application of epidemiological evidence , using good visualization techniques that improve doctors &quot; understanding of complex statistics . 
At the same time , research-derived facts about the average patient must not outweigh individual patients &quot; observations of their own bodies and illnesses . 
New processes for capturing and accommodating patients &quot; personal experiences - which are typically idiosyncratic , subjective , and impossible to standardize - would go a long way toward ensuring that each patient receives the right treatment . 
The medical community must develop the science of shared decision-making , in which epidemiological evidence informs conversations about what matters to the patient and how best to achieve those goals . 
In doing so , we can take evidence-based medicine beyond its current limits and develop a holistic approach that accounts for patients &quot; experience of illness and promotes good clinical practice .
