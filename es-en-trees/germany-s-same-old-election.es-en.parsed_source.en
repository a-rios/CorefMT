Germany &apos;s Same Old Election 
BERLIN - Germany &apos;s current parliamentary election campaign looks like a front-running contender for the title of the most boring in the history of the Federal Republic . 
The predominant response among commentators to the sole television debate between Chancellor Angela Merkel and her challenger , Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier , held two weeks before the election , was a collective yawn - all the more remarkable considering the historical events that overshadow this election . 
Twenty years ago , the Berlin Wall came down , triggering a seismic shift that moved the borders of the old Federal Republic and of Western Europe as a whole , hundreds of miles to the east . 
The vast Soviet empire exited the historical stage without a single shot being fired . 
This anniversary should have provided ample reason for a heated debate about the successes and failures of German reunification and for offering a vision for Germany and Europe for the next 20 years . 
Former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt once quipped that politicians who have a vision should go and have their eyes checked . 
That warning made sense in the 1970 &quot; s , when even young parliamentarians in his Social Democratic Party dreamed of revolution . 
Likewise , in the fall of 2008 , the threat of financial Armageddon brought not just Germany but the whole world to the brink of disaster . 
The worst has been mitigated and obscured in the wealthy countries by running up unprecedented levels of debt , but any moderately streetwise person knows that the next generation - and even the one after that - will be paying for the excesses of the investment bankers . 
One cannot help but marvel at how discreetly this topic is being dealt with by Merkel and Steinmeier . 
Ask the party strategists and they will tell you that the financial crisis is a topic for losers ; voters want to hear something positive . 
The electorate is experiencing the greatest slump since 1929 like a bad dream that is half over - and politicians don &apos;t want to wake them up . 
The so-called &quot; autonomous &quot; violent left-wing radicals in Berlin-Kreuzberg enjoy themselves by torching luxury cars , but not a single bank window has been smashed in Germany . 
Nor has a single criminal financier-gambler , who misled the financial regulators with fudged figures , been brought to justice . 
On the contrary , these bankrupts are filing lawsuits to get the million-dollar bonuses to which they feel entitled . 
Quite a few of them are already back at the table gambling away with the taxpayer &apos;s money and peddling their new &quot; financial products &quot; ; they know that when the next crash comes , the taxpayer will have no choice but to bail them out again . 
Only some stalwarts timidly point to the inflammatory question posed by Mack the Knife in Berthold Brecht &apos;s Threepenny Opera : &quot; What is a bank robbery compared to the founding of a bank ? 
What is a pick-lock compared to a debenture share ? &quot; 
But this slogan is from the 1920 &quot; s and seems like a nostalgic reminder of past turmoil that one prefers to see on the stage . 
The greatest miracle in the 2009 election campaign is the resurgence of the Liberal Democrats ( FDP ) . 
In fact , the German political landscape needs nothing more than a truly liberal party , in the US sense of the word &quot; liberal &quot; - a champion of the cause of individual freedom . 
Unfortunately , under the far-too-long leadership of Guido Westerwelle , the FDP has degenerated into a party notable for defending the freedom only of a few privileged individuals : bankers and businessmen . 
Just a year ago , the FDP fervently adhered to the religion of the American neo-cons , according to which markets regulate themselves . 
So it vigorously opposed all of the half-hearted attempts to regulate the financial sector . 
As late as this past May , the FDP defended the ownership rights of US billionaire Christopher Flowers , a major stockholder in the failed German bank Hypo Real Estate , which was saved from oblivion by state guarantees worth more than € 100 billion of taxpayers &quot; money . 
Nevertheless , at a time when finance is under a cloud , the party that defends the freedom of the financial gamblers over the freedom of the individual is winning favor with the electorate like no other . 
The FDP can count on about 13-14 % of the vote , which means that it may be able to join with Merkel &apos;s Christian Democratic Union to form a government . 
I cannot explain this dynamic . 
I do not believe in Karl Marx &apos;s iron laws of history . 
Yet one historical law does seem to apply : in an immense economic crisis , the voters stick with the people whose economic competence they have traditionally trusted - that is , the very people who led them to ruin . 
But there is an exception to every rule . 
In this case , it is the former PDS , the successor party to the former East Germany &apos;s ruling party , the SED . 
Dissidents in the GDR translated those three letters as &quot; P ractically t he S ame . &quot; 
This party , now using the presumptuous name &quot; The Left , &quot; has gained a foothold in West Germany with its impossible promises of higher pensions , a minimum hourly wage of € 10 , huge public investment schemes , and zero unemployment - in short , exactly the kind of socialist paradise that failed in East Germany . 
And , of course , The Left , which still counts large numbers of former Stasi personnel among its members , also calls for a reassessment of East Germany itself ; many party veterans object to the term &quot; dictatorship &quot; for this phase of their lives . 
So , besides the FDP , this party , too , is profiting from the mainstream political parties &quot; half-hearted handling of the global economic crisis . 
The only &quot; winner &quot; when Germans vote on September 27 will most likely be the &quot; party &quot; of non-voters . 
I do not sympathize with this group , but I do understand that non-voters expect only one thing of Germany &apos;s political parties these days : &quot; practically the same &quot;
