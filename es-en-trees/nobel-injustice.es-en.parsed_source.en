Nobel Injustice 
SINGAPORE - Martti Ahtisaari is a great man . 
As a recent story by Agence France Presse put it , Ahtisaari &apos;s &quot; most notable achievement was overseeing the 2005 reconciliation of the Indonesian government and the Free Aceh Movement rebels , bringing an end to a three-decade-old conflict that killed some 15,000 people . &quot; 
More fundamentally , the mentioning of Aceh in this Nobel citation raises serious questions about the mental maps used by the Nobel Prize Committee in making these awards . 
The committee members increasingly seem to be prisoners of the past . 
They continue to assume that we live in an era of Western domination of world history . 
But that era is over . 
Increasingly , the rest of the world has gone from being objects of world history to becoming its subjects . 
By giving the Nobel Peace Prize to the Indonesians instead of a European mediator for Aceh , the Nobel Prize Committee would have recognized that the world has changed . 
Three other big benefits would also have resulted from giving the award to an Indonesian . 
First , the West associates the Islamic world with violence and instability . 
Few believe that Muslims are capable of solving their political problems by themselves . 
But this is precisely what the Aceh story was all about . 
Two key Indonesian leaders , President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Vice President Jusuf Kalla , showed remarkable political skill and courage in working out the peace deal for Aceh . 
A Nobel Peace Prize for them would have shown the West that Muslims can be good peacemakers and , equally important , it would have sent a message of hope to the Islamic populations of the world that have seen their self-esteem eroded by stories of failure . 
Aceh was essentially a spectacular Muslim success story . 
Hence , the Nobel Peace Prize Committee has squandered a valuable opportunity to send out a message of hope to the world &apos;s 1.2 billion Muslims , one that would have rid the world of the grand global illusion that peacemaking is a &quot; white man &apos;s burden . &quot;
