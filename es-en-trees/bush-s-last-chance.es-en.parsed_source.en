Bush &apos;s Last Chance 
Though triggered by the need to devise an exit strategy from the Iraqi quagmire , the Iraq Study Group &apos;s grim report is a devastating indictment of the Bush administration &apos;s entire foreign policy . 
The report challenges the core principles of a faith-driven administration and of a president whose political gospel led him to a sharp departure from the culture of conflict resolution in favor of a crusade based on raw power . 
A war that cannot be ended is sometimes worse than a war that is lost . 
Therefore , the Iraq report is more than a plan to rescue Iraq ; it is a road map for extricating America from the mayhem of an unwinnable war . 
However much the study group shunned recommendations for a precipitous withdrawal , and avoided strict timetables for disengagement , their report is not only an unequivocal repudiation of Bush &apos;s &quot; stay the course &quot; obsession , but also a counsel to cut and run . 
Indeed , there is no realistic chance that the Iraqi army and police will be able to take over combat responsibilities and effective policing any time soon . 
The entire security apparatus in Iraq is corrupt and infiltrated by insurgents . 
Nor is it at all clear to what degree the Iraqis retain a stake in the idea of a united Iraqi state worth fighting for . 
The report practically calls for ending all support to the Iraqi government if it fails to assume its responsibilities . 
None of the Middle East &apos;s problems has a military solution , and none can be solved through unilateral action . 
The report is therefore right to challenge Bush &apos;s insistence on discarding both Iran and Syria as interlocutors for a more stable regional order . 
Iran has the most leverage inside Iraq , and Syria has become a vital crossing point for weapons and insurgents into the Iraqi battlefield . 
There is simply no way that Iraq can be stabilized without America moving from a policy of disengagement to one of engagement with these two major regional spoilers . 
The report thus stands as a rebuke to Bush &apos;s entire &quot; axis of evil &quot; philosophy . 
It refuses to ascribe to Iran &apos;s secretive state an ideological rigidity that might not exist . 
Indeed , Iran has shown its ability to behave with startling pragmatism more than once , not least in its links to Israel and the United States during its war against Iraq in the 1980 &quot; s , and in its assistance to the Americans in the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan . 
But it is not only Iraq that requires regional support groups to reach a modicum of stability . 
All the problems of the Middle East - Iraq , the Arab-Israeli dispute , the need for political reforms , and Islamic terrorism - are interconnected . 
The interconnectedness of the problems in the outer circle of the region and those pertaining to the Arab-Israeli conflict in the inner circle was shown by the first Bush administration , which , in October 1991 , following the first Gulf War , organized a major international conference aimed at securing an Arab-Israeli peace . 
Neither the Israeli government nor its intimate ally in the White House can be expected to applaud the Iraq Study Group &apos;s call for a repetition of that logic , for it contradicts everything the Bush administration has championed . 
The report &apos;s recommendation for an international conference in the style of the Madrid peace conference is not only a timely indication of the linkage between the Israeli-Arab conflict and the region &apos;s other troubles ; it is also a long overdue reminder that bilateral negotiations between the parties can not produce an agreement . 
That realization prompted the all-Arab peace initiative of 2002 , which established the conditions for an Israeli-Arab comprehensive settlement . 
Alas , however bipartisan the Iraq Study Group &apos;s report may be , it is too much to expect that Bush will endorse all of its recommendations and admit the bankruptcy of his entire foreign policy . 
In fact , Bush has already expressed his objection to unconditional direct talks with Iran and Syria . 
Nor does he seem eager to open a rift with Israel by dragging its government to an international conference , the way his father did with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1991 . 
Bush will find it especially difficult to change his policy with respect to Iran . 
In order to ensure that the US is too harassed to be able to threaten it , Iran has consistently obstructed Bush &apos;s mission of regional transformation . 
The report urges the president to understand that the spoilers will not cease to be spoilers as a precondition of negotiations , but only as a result of them . 
At stake is a painful choice for Bush : to lead America into coexistence with what he considers a repugnant Islamic theocracy . 
But Bush does not have many choices if he is to save his presidency from going down in history as an utter failure . 
His was a suicidal brand of statecraft from the outset . 
If he does not change course in Iraq and beyond , his presidency might draw the curtain on long decades of American hegemony in the Middle East - to the detriment of its closest allies in the region .
