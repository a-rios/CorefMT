The Ultra-Easy Money Experiment 
BASEL - The world &apos;s central banks are engaged in one of the great policy experiments in modern history : ultra-easy money . 
And , as the experiment has continued , the risk of failure - and thus of the wrenching corrections and deep economic dislocations that would follow - has grown . 
In the wake of the crisis that began in 2007 , policy rates were reduced to unprecedented levels , where they remain today , and measures were taken to slash longer-term rates as well . 
Nothing like it has ever been seen before at the global level , not even in the depths of the Great Depression . 
Moreover , many central banks &quot; balance sheets have expanded to record levels , although in different ways and for different rationales - further underscoring the experimental character of the monetary easing now underway . 
The risks implied by such policies require careful examination , particularly because the current experiment appears to be one more step down a well-trodden path - a path that led to the crisis in the first place . 
Beginning with the sharp monetary-policy easing that occurred following the 1987 stock-market crash , monetary policy has been used aggressively in the face of every economic downturn ( or even anticipated downturn ) ever since - in 1991 , 1998 , 2001 , and , with a vengeance , following the events of 2007 . 
Moreover , subsequent cyclical tightening was always less aggressive than the preceding easing . 
No surprise , then , that policy rates ( both nominal and real ) have ratcheted ever downward to where they are today . 
It can , of course , be argued that these policies produced the &quot; Great Moderation &quot; - the reduction in cyclical volatility - that characterized the advanced market economies in the years leading up to 2007 . 
Yet it can also be argued that each cycle of monetary easing culminated in a credit-driven &quot; boom and bust &quot; that then had to be met by another cycle of easing . 
With leverage and speculation increasing on a cumulative basis , this whole process was bound to end with monetary policy losing its effectiveness , and the economy suffering under the weight of imbalances ( or &quot; headwinds &quot; ) built up over the course of many years . 
The Swedish economist Knut Wicksell raised concerns about such problems long ago . 
He suggested that a money rate of interest ( set in the banking system ) that was less than the natural rate of interest ( set in the real economy ) would result in inflation . 
Later , economists in the Austrian tradition noted that imbalances affecting the real side of the economy ( &quot; malinvestments &quot; ) were of equal concern . 
Later still , Hyman Minsky contended that credit creation in a fiat-based monetary economy made economic crises inevitable . 
Finally , many economists in recent decades have identified how excessive leverage can do lasting damage to both the real and financial sides of the economy . 
Looking at the pre-2007 world , there was ample evidence to warrant such theoretical concerns . 
While globalization was holding down inflation , the real side of the world economy was exhibiting many unusual trends . 
Household saving rates in the English-speaking economies fell to unprecedented levels . 
Within Europe , credit flows to peripheral countries led to unprecedented housing booms in several countries . 
In China , fixed capital investment rose to an astonishing 40 % of GDP . 
Moreover , similar unusual trends characterized the financial side of the economy . 
A new &quot; shadow banking &quot; system evolved , with highly pro-cyclical characteristics , and lending standards plummeted even as financial leverage and asset prices rose to extremely high levels . 
The monetary policies pursued by central banks since 2007 have essentially been &quot; more of the same . &quot; 
They have been directed toward increasing aggregate demand without any serious concern for the unintended longer-term consequences . 
But it is increasingly clear that ultra-easy monetary policy is impeding the necessary process of deleveraging , threatening the &quot; independence &quot; of central banks , raising asset prices ( especially for bonds ) to unsustainable levels , and encouraging governments to resist making needed policy changes . 
To their credit , leading central bankers have stated repeatedly that their policies are only &quot; buying time &quot; for governments to do the right thing . 
What is not clear is whether anyone is listening . 
One important impediment to policy reform , on the part of both governments and central banks , is analytical . 
The mainstream models used by academics and policymakers differ in important respects but are depressingly similar in others . 
They emphasize short-term demand flows and presume a structurally stable world in which probabilities can be assigned to future outcomes - thus almost entirely ignoring uncertainty , stock accumulations , and the financial imbalances that characterize the real world . 
Recalling John Maynard Keynes &apos;s dictum that &quot; the world is ruled by little else &quot; but &quot; the ideas of economists and political philosophers , &quot; perhaps policymakers need new ideas . 
If so , the immediate prognosis for the global economy is not good . 
The latest fashion in policy advice is essentially still more of the same . 
The call for &quot; outright monetary financing &quot; involves raising government deficits still further and financing them through a permanent increase in base money issued by central banks . 
Targeting the level of nominal GDP ( or the unemployment rate , as in the United States ) is a way of convincing financial markets and potential spenders that policy rates will remain very low for a very long time . 
All of these policies run the risk of higher inflation and / or still more dangerous economic imbalances . 
Sadly , a fundamental mainstream reassessment of how the economy works is by no means imminent . 
It should be .
