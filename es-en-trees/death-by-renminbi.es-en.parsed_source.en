Death by Renminbi 
WASHINGTON , DC - Over the last several weeks , the dollar &apos;s depreciation against the euro and yen has grabbed global attention . 
In a normal world , the dollar &apos;s weakening would be welcome , as it would help the United States come to grips with its unsustainable trade deficit . 
A realignment of the dollar is long overdue . 
Its overvaluation began with the Mexican peso crisis of 1994 , and was officially enshrined by the &quot; strong dollar &quot; policy adopted after the East Asian financial crisis of 1997 . 
That policy produced short-term consumption gains for America , which explains why it was popular with American politicians , but it has inflicted major long-term damage on the US economy and contributed to the current crisis . 
The over-valued dollar caused the US economy to hemorrhage spending on imports , jobs via off-shoring , and investment to countries with under-valued currencies . 
In today &apos;s era of globalization , marked by flexible and mobile production networks , exchange rates affect more than exports and imports . 
China has been a major beneficiary of America &apos;s strong-dollar policy , to which it wedded its own &quot; weak renminbi &quot; policy . 
As a result , China &apos;s trade surplus with the US rose from $ 83 billion in 2001 to $ 258 billion in 2007 , just before the recession . 
So far in 2009 , China &apos;s surplus has accounted for 75 % of the total US non-oil-goods trade deficit . 
The under-valued renminbi has also made China a major recipient of foreign direct investment , even leading the world in 2002 - a staggering achievement for a developing country . 
The scale of recent US trade deficits was always unsustainable , and the dollar has therefore fallen against the yen , euro , Brazilian real , and Australian and Canadian dollars . 
But China retains its under-valued exchange rate policy , so that the renminbi has appreciated relatively less against the dollar . 
When combined with China &apos;s rapid growth in manufacturing capacity , this pattern promises to create a new round of global imbalances . China &apos;s policy creates adversarial currency competition with the rest of the world . 
By maintaining an undervalued currency , China is preventing the US from reducing its bilateral trade deficit . 
Furthermore , the problem is not only America &apos;s . 
China &apos;s currency policy gives it a competitive advantage relative to other countries , allowing it to displace their exports to the US . 
Worse still , other countries whose currencies have appreciated against the renminbi can look forward to a Chinese import invasion . 
China &apos;s currency policy means that dollar depreciation , rather than improving America &apos;s trade balance and stanching its leakage of jobs and investment , may inadvertently spread these problems to the rest of the world . 
In effect , China is fostering new imbalances at a time when countries are struggling with the demand shortfall caused by the financial crisis . 
The dollar is part of an exchange-rate Rubik &apos;s cube . 
With China retaining its under-valued currency policy , dollar depreciation can aggravate global deflationary forces . 
Yet a mix of political factors has led to stunning refusal by policymakers to confront China . 
On the US side , a lingering Cold War mentality , combined with the presumption of US economic superiority , has meant that economic issues are still deemed subservient to geo-political concerns . 
That explains the neglect of US-China economic relations , a neglect that is now dangerous to the US , given its weakened economic condition . 
With regard to the rest of the world , many find it easy to blame the US , often owing to resentment at its perceived arrogance . 
Moreover , there is an old mentality among Southern countries that they can do no wrong in their relationships with the North , and that they should exhibit solidarity with each other regarding those relationships . 
Finally , all countries likely have been shortsighted , imagining that silence will gain them commercial favors from China . 
The world economy has paid dearly for complicity with and silence about the economic policies of the last 15 years , which have culminated in the deepest and most dangerous recession since the 1930 &quot; s . 
It will pay still more if policymakers remain passive about China &apos;s destructive currency policy .
