The End of Kamikaze Pacifism ? 
Terror and Japan \ u0027s Peace Constitution 
Although I knew December 7 , 2001 marked its 60 th anniversary , I never imagined that the phrase &quot; Pearl Harbor &quot; would be heard so often this year . 
Its repetition began in a prosaic way , with the release of the Disney movie &quot; Pearl Harbor &quot; last June . 
After September 11 th , however , many Americans spoke of the terrorist assaults as &quot; the first attack against the US since Pearl Harbor . &quot; 
One person even told me that , because of those attacks , Japan had received a golden opportunity to clear its name of the stigma of Pearl Harbor . 
The way to achieve this , it seems , was for Japan to provide military support to the US . 
Critics of Japan &apos;s defense posture over the years have sometimes been unforgiving . 
The Economist , indeed , once derided the Japanese as &quot; kamikaze pacifists . &quot; 
The reality is that defense debates within Japan are invariably traumatic , based on sharp memories of the war and the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . 
Yet , despite this , Japan responded to the terrorist acts of September by passing a new law that allows the country to support American forces in the war against terrorists . 
The Anti-Terrorism Special Law , passed by Japan &apos;s Diet in October , enabled Japan to send its Self-Defense Forces ( SDF ) overseas to support - through supply , transportation , repair , maintenance , medical services and so on - American forces . 
Even though the SDF still cannot participate in combat , the Anti-Terrorism law is the first that allows Japan to dispatch armed forces to join in military operations outside Japanese territory and territorial waters while the shooting war is on . 
That Japan acted with alacrity after September 11 th reflects the trauma experienced during the Gulf War a decade ago . 
Although Japan paid much of the costs of that war by raising domestic taxes , its supportive actions went largely unnoticed . 
Indeed , the word &quot; Japan &quot; was nowhere to be seen in the advertisements Kuwait &apos;s government published after the war to thank the thirty nations of the international coalition that fought to expel Iraq from Kuwait . 
These debates are also traumatic for an institutional reason . 
Japan &apos;s so-called &quot; Peace Constitution , &quot; including Article 9 which prohibits the country from possessing &quot; war potential , &quot; was created after WWII under strong American pressure , and in atmosphere of deep self-reflection toward the Pacific War . 
Some of the concepts the Constitution contained were so alien to Japanese tradition that new ideograms had to be created to express them . 
The Cold War , however , soon made Article 9 seem excessively idealistic , at least to some . 
Ever since , Japan has witnessed a severe confrontation between Constitutional revisionists and those who want to protect the Peace Constitution as it was written . 
In reality , Japan has been realistic in interpreting the Constitution according to events . 
Over the years it did not revise the Constitution in a formal way but , instead , expanded its meaning by re-interpreting critical clauses . 
Such an informal revision allowed Japan to first create the SDF as well as to support the presence of American forces in Japan . 
Still , for most of the postwar era , we understood that Japan could not send the SDF abroad even to support allies . 
This was why Japan did not send the SDF to the Gulf . 
Previous to September 11 th , Japan undertook a big step toward dispatching military forces beyond its territory when it concluded an agreement with the US in 1997 - the &quot; Guideline for Defense Cooperation &quot; - that restricted operations to the &quot; area surrounding Japan . &quot; 
The new Anti-Terrorism Law virtually eliminated this restriction , making it possible for Japan to send its troops anywhere in the world at any time . 
To revise or not to revise the constitution , especially Article 9 , remains a divisive political issues here , for pressures for change come not only from within by conservative politicians , but from without . 
The so-called Armitage Report of 2000 , produced by a committee headed by the now Deputy US Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage , stirred up a hornet &apos;s nest when it said that &quot; Japan &apos;s prohibition against collective defense is a constraint on alliance cooperation &quot; and that &quot; lifting this prohibition would allow for closer and more efficient security cooperation . &quot; 
Here was a de facto request from America that Japan broaden its military cooperation . 
Because Mr. Armitage and many other American members of the joint committee became high officials in the Bush administration , Japan &apos;s politicians regarded a response to this report as vital . 
Arguments within the Japanese government concerning collective defense received greater focus . 
But establishing a practical meaning for &quot; collective defense &quot; remained difficult . 
Japan &apos;s new Anti-Terrorist law was one effort to impose clarity on the idea of &quot; collective defense . &quot; 
Prime Minister Koizumi testified in the Diet that the Constitution contained obscure and unclear terms and that Japan must interpret them with common sense . 
In the end , however , Mr. Koizumi avoided any formal commitment to act in &quot; collective defense &quot; or to revise the Constitution . 
Although both the Upper and Lower Houses of the Diet created special committees to investigate Constitutional revision - especially Article 9 - change remains hard , for several reasons . 
First , a majority of Japanese do not want to change Article 9 , as opinion polls consistently show . 
Article 9 remains a cherished symbol of Japan &apos;s peaceful posture , and a barrier against possible re-militarization . 
Japan was able to pass the new Anti-Terrorist law without revising the Constitution , but the limits of expansive Constitutional interpretation may one day be reached . 
The reaction of other Asian countries , especially China and South Korea , also creates limits on Constitutional revision . 
When Prime Minister Koizumi explained Japan &apos;s new Anti-Terrorist law in China and Korea in October , leaders in both countries offered sharp cautions , with Korea &apos;s President Kim Dae Jung telling Prime Minister Koizumi that , &quot; I hope the SDF behaves within the limits of the Peace Constitution . &quot; 
Whether or not Japan maintains Article 9 as it is , the Japanese public must begin to argue seriously and thoroughly about the country &apos;s proper future defense policy . 
Formulating a basic law governing national security , a law that would define the role and limit the actions of the SDF , is a mechanism we should seriously consider .
