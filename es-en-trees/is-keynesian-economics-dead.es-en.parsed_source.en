Is Keynesian Economics Dead ? 
Since capitalism &apos;s beginnings , the market economy has been subject to fluctuations , to booms and busts . 
Capitalist economies are not self-adjusting : market forces might eventually restore an economy of full employment , as Keynes said , but in the long run we are all dead . 
Keynes proposed clear prescriptions for hard economic times : expansionary monetary and fiscal policy . 
He thought fiscal policy particularly important in situations where monetary policy was likely to be ineffective . 
In advanced economies , Keynesian economics is the bread and butter of economic forecasting and policy making . 
Expansions are longer and downturns shallower and shorter , because Keynesian prescriptions work . 
Of course , theory and practice have been refined . 
The theory of asymmetric information provides much of the micro-foundations for modern macroeconomics . 
But some of the simplest and most important precepts , formulated well before these micro-foundations were well established - such as the fact that temporary income tax cuts are unlikely to be effective , while temporary investment tax credits can be extremely powerful - are as valid today as ever . 
We learn from economic policy failures as well as from successes . 
When the IMF forced large expenditure cuts in East Asia , output in those countries fell - just as Keynesian theory predicted . 
In early 1998 , when I was chief economist of the World Bank , I debated the US Treasury and the IMF concerning Russia . 
They said that any stimulation of the Russian economy would incite inflation . 
This was a remarkable admission : through their transition policies , they had managed , in just a few years , to decrease the productive capacity of the world &apos;s number two superpower by more than 40 % , a devastating outcome greater than that of any war ! 
The loss went well beyond the cutback in military expenditures , overwhelming the civilian industrial and agricultural sectors . 
In August 1998 , with the ruble &apos;s devaluation , we tested the alternative , Keynsian hypotheses : production soared , and relatively quickly , showing that policies emphasizing excessive austerity had caused unnecessary idleness of human and physical resources , and unnecessary suffering . 
Remarkably , the IMF was slow to learn the lesson . 
While it belatedly recognized its fiscal policy mistake in East Asia , it repeated it in Argentina , forcing expenditure cuts that deepened recession and boosted unemployment - to the point where things finally fell apart . 
Even now , the IMF has not acknowledged the lesson : it still insists on further cutbacks as a condition for assistance . 
The IMF continues to insist on an alternative economic &quot; theory &quot; ( though using that term may suggest a higher level of analysis than is merited )  - one which Keynes fought against over sixty years ago . 
In a nutshell , Keynes struggled against the notion that if only countries would cut their deficits , &quot; confidence &quot; would be restored , investment would return , and the economy would again attain full employment . 
Under &quot; IMF &quot; theory , investors , seeing government resolve to eliminate deficits , flock to the country , economic performance recovers , and the policy is vindicated . 
The government &apos;s budget targets are more than met . 
The temporary &quot; pain &quot; paid handsome rewards . 
I know of no country where this scenario has played out successfully , for there are two key problems with this &quot; theory . &quot; 
Confidence is important , but it is only one factor . 
For example , even if investors in telecoms become utterly confident in the US economy , they are not going to invest in more fiber optics , given today &apos;s huge excess capacity . 
Similarly , Argentina &apos;s export industries were unlikely to attract investors , regardless of the fiscal deficit , given the overvalued exchange rate , low export prices , and the many foreign markets that remain closed to Argentine goods . 
Even if &quot; confidence &quot; were the single most important factor , deficits are not the only , or even the most important factor determining investor confidence . 
A country in recession or depression does not inspire confidence . 
Contractionary policies only exacerbate recession . 
Investors in such a situation take a wait-and-see approach . 
As they wait , they will not like what they see . 
After all , the first effect of the expenditure cutbacks is a further decline in income , and with it profitability of investment . 
With the decline in income , tax revenues decline , and , if the country has any kind of social safety net , expenditures increase . 
The hoped-for improvement in the fiscal position does not materialize . 
At this point , the IMF castigates the country for failing to fulfill its commitments . 
But it is the IMF that should be castigated - for pushing an economic theory that was rejected long ago . 
Between 1999 and 2001 , Argentina &apos;s central government had done an impressive job of cutting back its expenditures , net of interest , by 10 % . 
What would have happened if Argentina &apos;s provincial governors had also miraculously been converted to the IMF &apos;s niggardly &quot; logic , &quot; as demanded ? 
I believe the downturn would have come earlier and more precipitously . 
Today &apos;s unemployment rates of 20 % or more ( with another 10-15 % of hidden joblessness ) would have been seen even before last December . 
Riots and political protests would have broken out earlier , too . 
Economics is a difficult subject , because we cannot conduct controlled experiments . 
There are not two or three Argentina &apos;s , one following the experiment that I described above , and another adopting the policies that I prefer . 
But we do have a wealth of experience from which to draw inferences . 
This wealth of experience all points in one direction : Keynes &apos;s teachings are still very much alive , and Argentina today would be in far better shape if his lessons had been taken to heart .
