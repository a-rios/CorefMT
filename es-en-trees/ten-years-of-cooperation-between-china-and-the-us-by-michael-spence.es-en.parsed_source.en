The Sino-American Decade 
HONG KONG - The California summit between US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping on June 7-8 comes at a time of heightened tension between the world &apos;s two preeminent powers . 
But divisive issues - from computer hacking to America &apos;s &quot; pivot to Asia &quot; - must not claim all of the attention . 
If Obama and Xi lift their heads above the parapets and begin charting a jointly agreed course through the coming decade , they may find that they have much in common . 
The next ten years will be characterized by major structural adjustments and shifts in individual economies , and by a huge reconfiguration of the global economy as a whole . 
Above all , much depends on the policies adopted by the two largest economies , China and the United States , and their cooperation and leadership in creating global public goods and maintaining a stable and open economic environment . 
Cooperation will be needed in many areas . 
One is the management of natural resources and the environment . 
The growth of China and the developing world will lead to a doubling of global output in 10-15 years , and probably a tripling in the 15 years after that . 
The growth model on which both advanced and developing countries relied in the past will not work at two or three times the scale . 
Climate , ecology , food , water , energy , and livability will not withstand the pressure . 
Global problems are hard to solve . 
A productive starting point would be China-US collaboration on energy efficiency and security , greener growth , and climate change . 
China &apos;s 12th Five-Year Plan sets ambitious goals in this area . 
In the US , progress is somewhat more decentralized , though new national policies have been adopted , including Corporate Average Fuel Economy ( CAFE ) standards for automobiles . 
The US also is set to become energy independent , owing to the rise of shale oil and gas , with diminishing reliance on coal already bringing down per capita carbon emissions . 
The complementarity of the Chinese and US economies is changing rapidly , but it is not declining in significance . 
In the past , the US brought a large open market , foreign direct investment , and technology , while China supplied low-cost labor-intensive components in key global manufacturing supply chains . 
Today , China provides a large and rapidly growing market for a widening array of previously unaffordable goods , and will increasingly produce as well as absorb new technologies . 
In the process , it will shed lower-value-added jobs in its export sector as production moves to lower-cost developing countries . 
Depending on policies on both sides , China may also become a foreign direct investor in the US economy in a wide range of areas - including infrastructure . 
The US will continue to provide a large open market , even as China &apos;s role in serving it will shift upward in value added and in global supply chains . 
The US will also provide , share , and absorb technology and human talent , remaining at the top end of the higher-education spectrum and in basic and applied research . 
Of course , there is also a healthy element of competition . 
The sharp differences in comparative advantage that were apparent two decades ago are diminishing as the gap in income , capital depth ( including human capital ) , and capabilities narrows . 
Chinese multinationals with recognized brands will begin to appear , just as they did in Japan and Korea . 
Fair , rules-based competition in a rapidly expanding global economy is far from a zero-sum game . 
The outlines of the structural changes needed to move toward a healthier , more sustainable growth pattern in the coming decade are relatively clear in China . 
The remaining questions concern policy implementation and institutional development - issues that will be clarified in the course of 2013 , as China &apos;s new leaders formalize and communicate their reform priorities . 
The US economy , meanwhile , retains many elements of dynamism and flexibility . 
But , while GDP growth seems to be returning slowly to potential , the slow pace of recovery in employment and the residual secular shifts in income distribution remain causes of concern . 
In particular , the shift of income from those who save less to those who save more implies uncertainty about the restoration of aggregate demand . 
Political polarization has become another source of uncertainty . 
Many centrists agree that an optimal fiscal policy would feature short-term stimulus , a multi-year medium-term deficit reduction plan , and measures to reduce long-term liabilities , especially if retrenchment protected growth-oriented public-sector investments . 
But that is difficult to achieve in a context of deleveraging and fixation on debt . 
If current trends continue , with the US economy recovering slowly but steadily , the pattern of convergence with China will continue . 
East Asia as a whole will surpass the US in terms of aggregate GDP by 2015 , with China contributing the highest proportion of the total . 
China &apos;s GDP is projected to catch up to that of the US and Europe in 10-15 years , at which point ( if not sooner ) both Chinese and US real GDP will exceed $ 25 trillion ( in 2012 prices ) , more than three times China &apos;s current GDP . 
Each will account for approximately 15 % of global output . 
And yet this shift will be accompanied by very substantial global economic challenges and uncertainties , underscoring the importance of Sino-US cooperation . 
A constructive , cooperative relationship can make a significant contribution to both countries &quot; efforts to adapt their policies and institutions to achieve sustainable , inclusive growth patterns . 
Beyond the bilateral benefits , the rest of the global economy is dependent on Chinese and US leadership - both in terms of growth and in matters concerning global economic governance and coordination . 
Trade and economic openness , financial stability and regulation , energy security , climate change , and many other issues confront the world collectively . 
It is very difficult to imagine successful global rebalancing and progress without China and the US taking a leading role in the process .
