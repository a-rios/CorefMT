Innovate or Stagnate 
DUBAI - Companies , like people , grow old . 
They start life small and eager to survive , fueled by youthful energy and fresh ideas . 
They compete , expand , mature , and eventually , with few exceptions , fade into obscurity . 
The same is true of governments : they , too , can lose the hunger and ambition of youth and allow themselves to become complacent . 
Consider this : only 11 % of the Fortune 500 companies from 1955 still exist today , while the average time that companies stay in the top 500 has fallen from 75 years to 15 years . 
In this age of rapid change , those who lag behind become irrelevant- in a heartbeat . 
Countries whose governments grow old face the same fate as outdated companies . 
Their choice is simple : innovate or become irrelevant . 
The race for national competitiveness is every bit as fierce as the competition among companies in the marketplace . 
Countries compete for investment , talent , growth , and opportunity in a globalized world , and those that are pushed out of the running surrender the greatest prize of all : human development , prosperity , and happiness for their people . 
To avoid this fate , governments must focus on what really matters : how to be like the 11 % of companies that have remained , through the decades , in the top 500 . 
The lifecycle of companies should teach governments that the secret of eternal youth is constant innovation - seizing opportunities and behaving like the dynamic , entrepreneurial companies that are defining today &apos;s world and shaping its future . 
The key to corporations &quot; rejuvenation , civilizations &quot; evolution , and human development in general is simple : innovation . 
I am always amazed when governments think they are an exception to this rule . 
Innovation in government is not an intellectual luxury , a topic confined to seminars and panel discussions , or a matter only of administrative reforms . 
It is the recipe for human survival and development , the fuel for constant progress , and the blueprint for a country &apos;s rise . 
The first key to business-like innovation in government is a focus on skills . 
Top-tier companies continuously invest in their employees to provide them with the right skills for the marketplace . 
Governments must do the same , by constantly upgrading skills and nurturing innovation - among their own employees , across key sectors of the economy , and at the foundations of the education system . 
Governments that fail to equip new generations with the skills needed to become leaders for their time are condemning them to be led by other , more innovative societies . 
A United States Department of Labor study found that 65 % of children currently in primary school will grow up to work in jobs that do not exist today . 
Another study at Oxford University found that 47 % of job categories are at high risk of ceasing to exist because they can be automated through technology . 
So , how do we prepare our children and future generations for such times ? 
How do we equip our countries to compete , not only today , but in the coming decades as well ? 
The answer lies in honing our children &apos;s creativity , and providing them with the analytical and communication skills needed to channel it toward productive ends . 
The second key to transforming governments into engines of innovation is to shift the balance of investment toward intangibles , as in the private sector . 
Whereas more than 80 % of the value of the Standard 
Poor &apos;s 500 consisted of tangible assets 40 years ago , today that ratio is reversed : more than 80 % of the largest companies &quot; value is intangible - the knowledge and skills of their employees and the intellectual property embedded in their products . 
Governments , too , should think strategically about shifting their spending away from tangible infrastructure like roads and buildings , and toward intangibles like education and research and development . 
It is no secret that the US and Europe , combined , spend more than $ 250 billion of public funds annually on R D to maintain their leading positions . 
Likewise , a key driver of rapid development in countries like Singapore , Malaysia , and South Korea has been their strategic decision to shift public expenditure away from hard infrastructure and toward the &quot; soft &quot; infrastructure needed to build and sustain a knowledge economy . 
Likewise , the British government spends markedly more of its budget on such intangibles than on tangible assets . 
Most of today &apos;s transformative companies are well known for having an innovative corporate culture and working environment that inspires and empowers employees . 
Governments that set an example for innovation have the power to implant a nationwide culture of creativity . 
When such a culture takes root , people feel inspired to run further with their ideas , to aim higher with their ambitions , and to pursue bigger dreams . 
That is how countries that encourage innovation take the lead - and stay there . 
To sustain innovation , businesses must attract and retain the most creative and productive minds . 
In this age of global mobility , countries , too , go head to head in the battle for talent . 
Global cities compete to provide an ideal life and work environment for innovators , and to harness their creativity to become stronger and more competitive still . 
Innovative governments do the same thing on a national scale . 
They attract talent , perform efficiently , and continually upgrade their systems and services . 
They empower citizens to cultivate their collective energy and develop their potential , and thus become drivers of their countries &quot; growth and advancement in the world arena . 
Above all , they value human minds and help people become better guardians and builders of our planet . 
For governments , innovation is an existential question . 
Only those that sustain innovation can drive change in the world , because they are the governments that never grow old .
