Integrating Russia &apos;s Post-Imperium 
MOSCOW - With Russia &apos;s 2012 presidential elections effectively over since Vladimir Putin &apos;s decision to reclaim his old Kremlin office , it is time to turn from personalities to policies . 
Putin plans to stay in the Kremlin for two more presidential terms , another 12 years , as he is enabled to do by the recently-amended constitution . 
So who will be Russia &apos;s next president is now a certainty ; less obvious is what he hopes to achieve . 
One issue , however , has now shot to the top of Russia &apos;s political agenda : Eurasian integration . 
In early October , Putin wrote a newspaper article that proclaimed what appears to be his reigning foreign-policy goal : a Eurasian Union of former Soviet states . 
Two weeks later , in St. Petersburg , he hosted a meeting of Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) prime ministers , eight of whom signed an agreement establishing a free-trade area among their countries . 
On January 1 , 2012 , Belarus , Kazakhstan , and Russia , which now form a customs union , will join a single economic space . 
And Putin wants even more : a &quot; Eurasian Schengen &quot; ( free movement of people among the three countries , built on the example of the European Union ) by 2015 , followed by a currency union and , ultimately , full economic integration . 
Indeed , Putin wants to restructure Russia &apos;s relations with the former Soviet states to create not merely a bigger market , but eventually an economic bloc-cum-security alliance . 
The feasibility of this plan is not to be taken for granted . 
Ever since the Soviet Union broke up 20 years ago , there has been much talk about reintegrating the successor states . 
Little has come of it , owing mainly to Russia &apos;s reluctance to support the other countries financially . 
At the same time , the other CIS countries have maintained an overriding focus on their own state-building and independence vis-à-vis Russia . 
Both factors , however , may now be changing - at least somewhat . 
Russia , which a half-dozen years ago abruptly ended its energy subsidies to Ukraine , Belarus , Moldova , and others , is now expressing interest in supporting some of its struggling neighbors , in exchange for some of their most lucrative assets . 
During the 2008-2009 global crisis , Moscow began to strengthen its regional economic standing and promote the establishment of the customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan , even at the risk of complicating its own bid for membership in the World Trade Organization . 
For Russia &apos;s partners , too , the current forms of integration , such as the customs union and the forthcoming single economic space , are pragmatic arrangements that serve their interests . 
In Belarus and Kazakhstan combined , Russia has gained 25 million potential new consumers ; 
Belarus and Kazakhstan , for their part , have widened their access to the 140 million-strong Russian market . 
The Russian market is also attractive to many others , from tiny Kyrgyzstan to sizable Ukraine . 
In the latter &apos;s case , for example , the prospects of closer association with the EU have dimmed recently , owing to the EU &apos;s internal difficulties , as well as to the Ukrainian authorities &quot; politically-motivated prosecution of former Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko . 
In his much-quoted newspaper piece , Putin denied that his new integration plans are aimed at restoring the Soviet Union under another name . 
This is a credible claim , for three basic reasons : the complete evaporation of Russia &apos;s imperial élan , its unwillingness to pay other countries &quot; bills , and the new countries &quot; unwillingness to cede too much sovereignty to the former hegemon . 
Consequently , Russia has been strict about the terms of its financial assistance to Belarus , pressing its government to open up its economy to Russian business . 
And , for all their interest in the Russian market , neither Belarus nor Kazakhstan has acceded to Russia &apos;s desire that they recognize the independence of Georgia &apos;s breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions . 
Putin is ambitious , but he is also cautious . 
He probably sees that only mutual economic interest can do the trick . 
Creating a new Council for Mutual Economic Assistance ( COMECON , the Soviet-era trade bloc ) , or a new Warsaw Pact , is as impossible as a latter-day Soviet Union . 
Eurasian economic integration , if it stands a chance , must follow a different path . 
If all parties concerned join voluntarily , and proceed in a step-by-step manner , as with the EU or the North American Free Trade Agreement , Eurasian integration will benefit all of those involved . 
Rather than behaving like an empire secretly trying to re-invent itself , Russia has an opportunity to become a regional leader . 
But Eurasian integration will fail if Russia &apos;s partners see the process as Moscow &apos;s attempt at political domination . 
All of this has geopolitical implications . 
In Eastern Europe , Russia is clearly drawing Belarus closer , and is competing with the EU over Ukraine &apos;s future economic orientation . 
Meanwhile , in Central Asia , Russia , having built strong economic ties with Kazakhstan , is now reaching out to Kyrgyzstan , thus competing more actively with neighboring China . 
Rather than choosing between Brussels and Beijing , Moscow now seeks to turn Russia &apos;s post-imperial neighborhood into a community . 
And , as a long-term goal , Putin envisions a close economic relationship between his Eurasian Union and the EU in what he calls a Greater Europe . 
In the West , Putin &apos;s best-remembered statement about the Soviet Union described its end as the &quot; greatest catastrophe of the twentieth century . &quot; 
But Putin &apos;s other comments , less familiar to Western readers , refer to the Soviet system as &quot; unviable . &quot; 
In his ruthless judgment , those who want the USSR back &quot; have no brains . &quot; 
Twenty years after the loss of its twentieth-century empire , Russia is ready to move toward a new kind of integration with its ex-provinces . 
This is not intended as a threat to others ; rather , economic integration is a test of how much Russia has learned about the world since 1991 , and of how much more modern it has become as a result .
