The Coming Atlantic Century 
PRINCETON - The United States is rising ; 
That was the principal message earlier this month at the annual Munich Security Conference ( MSC ) , a high-powered gathering of defense ministers , foreign ministers , senior military officials , parliamentarians , journalists , and national-security experts of every variety . 
The participants come primarily from Europe and the US ; indeed , when the conference began in 1963 , it was focused entirely on NATO members . 
This year , however , senior government officials from Brazil , China , India , Nigeria , Singapore , Qatar , and Saudi Arabia also joined , an important sign of the times . 
John McCain , the US senator and 2008 presidential candidate , always leads a large congressional delegation to Munich . 
The US administration also typically sends the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of State to deliver a ritual speech reassuring the Europeans of the strength of the transatlantic alliance . 
This year , Vice President Joe Biden did the honors , bumping the US representation up a notch . 
The conference also featured a panel on an unusual subject - &quot; The American Oil and Gas Bonanza : The Changing Geopolitics of Energy . &quot; 
US Special Envoy and Coordinator for International Energy Affairs Carlos Pascual described &quot; the US internal energy revolution &quot; : a 25 % increase in natural-gas production , which should push down US gas prices , and enough oil output to reduce oil imports from 60 % to 40 % of consumption , with an additional 10 % increase projected . 
Pascual projected that the US will be able to import all of its energy needs from within the Americas by 2030 . 
A recent confidential study by the German Intelligence Agency raises the possibility that the US could actually become an oil and gas exporter by 2020 , in contrast to its present position as the world &apos;s largest energy importer . 
That honor would likely fall to China , which would become increasingly dependent on the Middle East . 
The sense of US good fortune , a phrase that is not often heard around the world these days , increased with the panelists &quot; description of how lower energy prices for US manufacturing has a broad positive impact on the American economy &apos;s competitiveness . 
As a result , the country &apos;s energy reserves have also become an investment magnet . 
German Minister of Economics and Technology Philipp Rösler said that many German firms are already relocating to the US because of lower energy prices . 
Equally important , the panelists reported on the rising importance of liquid natural gas relative to pipeline gas , which has enormous geopolitical implications . 
In a nutshell , if gas is exported in liquid form , it is fungible . 
In other words , if Russia restricts the flow of gas to Ukraine for political reasons , but the rest of Europe has gas from other sources , they can simply resell their gas to Ukraine and export it via the Baltic Sea . 
Jorma Ollila , Chairman of Royal Dutch Shell , described the global map of major shale oil and gas deposits . 
Ukraine itself has the third-largest reserves in Europe ; other countries with large deposits include Poland , France , China , Indonesia , Australia , South Africa , Argentina , and Mexico . 
And the US has already taken over from Russia as the world &apos;s largest gas producer . 
All of this data got Brazilian Foreign Minister Antonio de Aguiar Patriota &apos;s attention . 
On a panel entitled &quot; The Rising Powers and Global Governance , &quot; Patriota referred to the energy discussion and noted that the rising powers should remember that &quot; the established powers are not sinking powers . &quot; 
In short , the pervasive narrative of Western decline suddenly reversed itself . 
The horizon seemed brighter on the European side as well . 
In the opening panel on &quot; The Euro Crisis and the Future of the EU , &quot; cautious optimism prevailed . 
No one thought that the European Union &apos;s troubles were resolved , but no one thought that the eurozone was coming apart , either . 
On the contrary , German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble made clear that German resolve to see the eurozone through its troubles was firm . 
And a prominent economist in the audience who has often predicted the eurozone &apos;s demise was backtracking rapidly . 
Aside from reports of a rising US ( fiscal woes notwithstanding ) and a stabilizing Europe ( despite the common currency &apos;s troubles ) , the conference featured a speech by Biden that went far beyond the reassuring rhetoric that US policymakers typically offer in European capitals . 
Biden told the audience that he and US President Barack Obama believe that &quot; Europe is the cornerstone of our engagement with the rest of the world &quot; and &quot; the catalyst for our global cooperation . &quot; 
Biden pointed out that &quot; Europe is America &apos;s largest economic partner , &quot; recalling figures that the Asia-focused Obama administration has often seemed to forget : &quot; over $ 600 billion in annual trade that creates and sustains millions of jobs on the continent and at home , and a $ 5 trillion overall commercial relationship . &quot; 
Biden went on to suggest a &quot; comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment agreement &quot; ; a week later , in his State of the Union Address , Obama announced the launch of negotiations for precisely such an agreement . 
Biden concluded with a flourish . 
&quot; Europe remains America &apos;s indispensable partner of first resort , &quot; he declared . 
&quot; And , if you forgive some presumptuousness , I believe we remain your indispensable partner . &quot; 
Those strong words reflect a new sensibility in Washington . 
As former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared in one of her last foreign-policy speeches , the US is not planning to pivot away from Europe to Asia , but rather with Europe to Asia . 
Western fortunes are rising , slowly but surely . 
Together , Europe and the US account for more than 50 % of global GDP , have the largest military force in the world by many multiples , and control a growing proportion of global energy reserves . 
They also have a formidable diplomatic and development-assistance capacity , representing a peaceful community of democracies that share a common commitment to the rights , dignity , and potential of all human beings . 
Imagine that community spreading down the east coast of Latin America and the west coast of Africa . 
It might be an Atlantic century after all .
