The Climate-Policy Trap 
ROME - Today &apos;s policies to combat climate change cost much more than the benefits they produce . 
Unfortunately , bad political choices often make these policies even less cost-effective . 
Consider the European Union &apos;s 20-20 policy , which targets a 20 % reduction in CO2 emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 . 
It is important to examine this approach , not only because the EU is pursuing the world &apos;s largest and most ambitious climate policy , but also because other climate policies suffer from similar shortcomings . 
The most cost-efficient way to achieve the 20 % target would be to operate a single , EU-wide carbon-market , which would cost the EU about $ 96 billion annually by 2020 . 
But the benefits to the entire world would be much lower . 
Indeed , the only peer-reviewed overview of EU climate policy estimates that it can avoid climate-related damage of about $ 10 billion per year . 
So , for every dollar spent , the EU stands to avoid about ten cents of damage . 
This does not mean that climate change is not important ; it means only that the EU &apos;s climate policy is not smart . 
Over the course of this century , the ideal EU policy would cost more than $ 7 trillion , yet it would reduce the temperature rise by just 0.05oC and lower sea levels by a trivial nine millimeters . 
After spending all that money , we would not even be able to tell the difference . 
Advocates of the EU &apos;s policy often argue that we should pursue such policies nonetheless , because there is a risk that global warming will be much more severe than currently expected . 
But , though this argument is valid in principle , economic models show that this risk has only a moderate effect on the best policy . 
Moreover , the absence of any temperature rise over the past 10-17 years has made such worse-than-expected outcomes extremely unlikely . 
The real risk concerns the potential for bad political choices to make climate policies worse than necessary . 
The EU did not just implement a single carbon market in order to meet its target for CO2 emissions . 
Instead , the EU made a bad deal a lot costlier through a host of partly contradictory policies . 
For example , the EU demanded that renewables like wind and solar account for 20 % of energy supplies by 2020 , though this is by no means the cheapest way to cut emissions . 
In fact , putting up a wind turbine cuts no extra CO2 , because total emissions are already capped under the EU-wide carbon-trading scheme . 
It simply means that when Great Britain installs a wind turbine , it becomes cheaper to burn coal in Portugal or Poland . 
Taking into account such poor policies and averaging all macroeconomic models , the EU is more likely to pay around $ 280 billion per year to avert $ 10 billion in damage . 
In other words , the poor design of EU climate policies triples the cost and prevents only three cents of climate damage per dollar spent . 
But it gets worse , because these models still assume that the EU picks the cheapest renewables to fulfill its requirements . 
Instead , most EU countries give higher subsidies to the most costly renewables . 
For example , cutting a ton of CO2 with on-shore wind turbines in Germany probably costs about $ 35 , avoiding about 14 cents of climate damage per dollar . 
But offshore wind turbines cost about $ 150 per ton of CO2 , avoiding just three cents of climate damage per dollar . 
Biofuels are even less efficient , costing more than $ 300 per ton of CO2 avoided , while doing just over one cent of good per dollar . 
And solar takes the absolute prize , costing more than $ 800 per ton of CO2 to do less than a cent of good per dollar spent . 
These prices are not unique to Europe . 
China pays $ 38 per ton of CO2 avoided with wind power , for example , while the US pays around $ 600 for cutting a ton of CO2 with biofuels . 
Moreover , when the EU decides to cut its domestic emissions , part of the reduction simply migrates elsewhere . 
If making a product in the EU costs more because of higher energy costs , the product will likely be made somewhere else , where energy is cheaper , and then imported into the EU . 
In fact , new studies show that 38 % of the EU carbon cuts leak elsewhere , meaning that European climate policy avoids not three cents of climate damage per dollar spent , but less than two . 
From 1990 to 2008 , the EU cut its emissions by about 270 million metric tons of CO2 . 
But it turns out that the increase in imports from China alone implied an almost equal volume of extra emissions outside the EU . 
Essentially , the EU had simply shipped part of its emissions offshore . 
Finally , the negative effects of poor climate policies are not just financial . 
Biofuels , for which the EU alone is now paying more than $ 10 billion annually to do less than one cent of good for every dollar spent , also take up fields that otherwise would have produced food . 
That means that food production moves elsewhere , often to farmland created by cutting down forests , which releases more CO2 and damages biodiversity . 
It also drives up food prices , which so far has pushed at least 30 million poor people into starvation , with another 40-130 million expected to be starving by 2020 . 
We need a smarter approach to tackling climate change . 
Rather than relying on cutting a few tons of incredibly overpriced CO2 now , we need to invest in research and development aimed at innovating down the cost of green energy in the long run , so that everyone will switch . 
For now , our current climate policies are poor - and our politicians consistently find ways to make them even poorer . 
They may please farmers and other interest groups , but overall they simply drive up costs and reduce already-minimal benefits .
