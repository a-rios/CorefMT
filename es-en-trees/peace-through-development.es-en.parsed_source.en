Peace Through Development 
New York - American foreign policy has failed in recent years mainly because the United States relied on military force to address problems that demand development assistance and diplomacy . 
Young men become fighters in places like Sudan , Somalia , Pakistan , and Afghanistan because they lack gainful employment . 
Extreme ideologies influence people when they can &apos;t feed their families , and when lack of access to family planning leads to an unwanted population explosion . 
President Barack Obama has raised hopes for a new strategy , but so far the forces of continuity in US policy are dominating the forces of change . 
The first rule in assessing a government &apos;s real strategy is to follow the money . 
America vastly overspends on the military compared with other areas of government . 
Obama &apos;s projected budgets do not change that . 
For the coming 2010 fiscal year , Obama &apos;s budget calls for $ 755 billion in military spending , an amount that exceeds US budget spending in all other areas except so-called &quot; mandatory &quot; spending on social security , health care , interest payments on the national debt , and a few other items . 
Indeed , US military spending exceeds the sum of federal budgetary outlays for education , agriculture , climate change , environmental protection , ocean protection , energy systems , homeland security , low-income housing , national parks and national land management , the judicial system , international development , diplomatic operations , highways , public transport , veterans affairs , space exploration and science , civilian research and development , civil engineering for waterways , dams , bridges , sewerage and waste treatment , community development , and many other areas . 
This preponderance of military spending applies to all ten years of Obama &apos;s medium-term scenario . 
By 2019 , total military spending is projected to be $ 8.2 trillion , exceeding by $ 2 trillion the budgeted outlays for all non-mandatory budget spending . 
US military spending is equally remarkable when viewed from an international perspective . 
According to the Swedish International Peace Research Institute , total military spending in constant 2005 dollars reached roughly $ 1.4 trillion in 2007 . 
In other words , the US spends roughly the same amount spent by the rest of the world combined - a pattern that the Obama administration shows no signs of ending . 
While the US has signed an agreement with Iraq to leave by the end of 2011 , there is talk in the Pentagon that US &quot; non-combat &quot; troops will remain in the country for years or decades to come . 
It is easy to see how the persistence of instability in Iraq , Iranian influence , and al-Qaeda &apos;s presence will lead American policymakers to take the &quot; safe &quot; route of continued military involvement . 
Some opponents of the Iraq War , including me , believe that a fundamental - and deeply misguided - objective of the war from the outset has been to create a long-term military base ( or bases ) in Iraq , ostensibly to protect oil routes and oil concessions . 
As the examples of Iran and Saudi Arabia show , however , such a long-term presence sooner or later creates an explosive backlash . 
The worries are even worse in Afghanistan and Pakistan . 
NATO &apos;s war with the Taliban in Afghanistan is going badly , so much so that the commanding US general was sacked this month . 
The Taliban are also extending their reach into neighboring Pakistan . 
Both Afghanistan and the neighboring provinces of Pakistan are impoverished regions , with vast unemployment , bulging youth populations , prolonged droughts , widespread hunger , and pervasive economic deprivation . 
It is easy for the Taliban and al-Qaeda to mobilize fighters under such conditions . 
The problem is that a US military response is essentially useless under these conditions , and can easily inflame the situation rather than resolve it . 
Among other problems , the US relies heavily on drones and bombers , leading to a high civilian death toll , which is inflaming public attitudes against the US . 
A recent survey showed overwhelming Pakistani opposition to US military incursions into their country . 
Obama is doubling down in Afghanistan , by raising the number of US troops from 38,000 to 68,000 , and perhaps more later . 
There are also risks that the US will get involved much more heavily in the fighting in Pakistan . 
The new US commanding general in Afghanistan is reportedly a specialist in &quot; counter-insurgency , &quot; which could well involve surreptitious engagement by US operatives in Pakistan . 
If so , the results could prove catastrophic , leading to a spreading war in an unstable country of 180 million people . 
What is disconcerting , however , is not only the relentless financing and spread of war , but also the lack of an alternative US strategy . 
A few billion dollars has been recommended to fund economic aid for Afghanistan and Pakistan . 
Before investing hundreds of billions of dollars more in failing military operations , the Obama administration should re-think its policy and lay out a viable strategy to US citizens and the world . 
It &apos;s high time for a strategy of peace through sustainable development - including investments in health , education , livelihoods , water and sanitation , and irrigation - in today &apos;s hotspots , starting with Afghanistan and Pakistan . 
Such a strategy cannot simply emerge as a byproduct of US military campaigns . 
Rather , it will have to be developed proactively , with a sense of urgency and in close partnership with the affected countries and the communities within them . 
A shift in focus to economic development will save a vast number of lives and convert the unthinkably large economic costs of war into economic benefits through development . 
Obama must act before today &apos;s crisis explodes into an even larger disaster .
