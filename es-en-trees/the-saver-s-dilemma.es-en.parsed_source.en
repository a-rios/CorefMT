The Saver &apos;s Dilemma 
BRUSSELS - Interest rates are now close to zero throughout the developed world ( the United States , Europe , and Japan ) . 
But the global economy is slowing down , and financial markets went into a tailspin during the summer . 
This suggests that the problem is more profound than one of insufficient monetary stimulus . 
The heart of any economy is the mechanism by which funds are channeled from savers to investors . 
In normal times , capital markets perform this function smoothly ; but these markets break down from time to time , owing to sudden large changes in perceptions about the riskiness of important asset classes . 
In the US , this happened when investors discovered that even AAA-rated asset-backed securities were in reality risky . 
China experienced a similar surprise when the US government lost its AAA rating . 
But nowhere is the problem as acute as it is in Europe , or , rather , the eurozone , where German savers are suddenly discovering risk across the European periphery . 
What is true of Germany is also true of most of the countries of Northern Europe , many of which now run current-account surpluses that are even larger as a proportion of GDP . 
These countries &quot; households continue to save , accumulating deposits at their local banks and buying bonds from their local wealth managers . 
But they feel that the eurozone has become such a dangerous place that they no longer dare to invest abroad . 
Greece , Ireland , and Portugal are off-limits because their bonds no longer rate as investment-grade , which means that banks are not allowed to sell them to individual savers . 
But even investment-grade Spain and Italy have now suddenly been classified as precarious , implying that risk managers everywhere tell investors to cut their exposure . 
The fundamental problem is simple : the market cannot be brought back into equilibrium when savers do not want to lend to those who would be willing to take these savings . 
Lower interest rates are not a solution to this dilemma . 
In the US , demand has not recovered , despite almost three years of near-zero interest rates . 
In Europe , lower rates risk aggravating the problem by lowering the returns for savers . 
When the yield on German government bonds falls to 2 % , which is negative in real terms , German savers must redouble their efforts to achieve a certain target for retirement income . 
This is why the current spiral of ever-lower interest rates in Germany ( and northern Europe ) and higher risk premia for most of the rest of the eurozone is so destructive . 
Lower interest rates can thus lead to lower consumption in surplus countries , thereby increasing the supply of loanable funds . 
But higher risk premia elsewhere force the rest of the eurozone to cut spending , thus reducing their demand for these funds . 
Indeed , stock markets are tanking precisely because investors fear that ever-increasing risk premia in the eurozone &apos;s peripheral countries will force them to stop consuming and investing , leading to lower German rates and thus inducing German households to reduce their consumption as well . 
But a weaker German economy makes adjustment in the periphery even more difficult . 
The most radical way to break this vicious circle would be to introduce Eurobonds . 
National risk premia would then disappear , and German savers would have no problem investing their savings in the eurozone &apos;s periphery , knowing that the German government would ultimately underwrite these countries &quot; government bonds . 
The eurozone economy could then recover quickly . 
This is why market participants like to repeat that only Eurobonds will end the crisis . 
But Eurobonds would also create huge incentive problems , because debtors in the eurozone periphery would no longer have to fear any punishment by markets and might thus be induced to consume and invest too much . 
What Europe needs is a mechanism that lets the capital market work most of the time , but that enables intervention when it ceases to function . 
In other words , the eurozone needs a European Monetary Fund that prevents this vicious circle from tightening by providing bridging finance when capital markets break down . 
Europe now has such an institution in the form of the European Financial Stability Facility - but the EFSF needs to be much better financed to allow it to fulfill this function . 
But even the creation of a European Monetary Fund cannot save the world economy if confidence between China and the US breaks down . 
The general lesson from the euro crisis and the US rating downgrade is simple : given that so many countries have chronic excess savings ( Germany , Japan , China , oil exporters ) , the world economy cannot recover without finding ways to channel these excess savings to economies that are both creditworthy and willing to borrow . 
Both sides will have to make an effort : Creditors must accept some risk , and debtors must enhance their creditworthiness through structural fiscal adjustment and reforms that improve their growth prospects .
