Healing Bolivia 
BUENOS AIRES - Since the mid-19th century , Latin America has suffered fewer inter-state wars and undergone less state creation than any other region of the world . 
The continent has been a relatively quiet periphery because its countries tend neither to fight each other nor to divide from within . 
Bolivia , however , may be poised to buck the latter trend . 
A referendum on autonomy which was approved in May in Bolivia &apos;s eastern province of Santa Cruz has generated fear about the region &apos;s eventual secession . 
This relatively rich , opposition-controlled , ethnically mixed , and more conservative province , blessed with fertile lowlands and hydrocarbons , voted for autonomy by a wide margin . 
The most outspoken anti-government forces in Santa Cruz seem to be itching for partition . 
And recent referendums in the Amazonian provinces of Beni and Pando appeared to have exacerbated this sense of potential national fracturing . 
A key ingredient of this simmering conflict is ethnicity , the salience of which became evident even before the election of President Evo Morales in 2005 . 
The combination of highly mobilized and vocal indigenous groups ( the Amerindians , mainly located in the western highlands of Bolivia , represent some 55 % of the population ) and the declining influence of traditional elites at a time of socio-economic deterioration , has created a society in which there are more losers than winners . 
The referendum marked a critical conjuncture of Bolivia &apos;s social , regional , and political divisions . 
Yet , despite Bolivia &apos;s arrival at this gloomy turning point , events can , paradoxically , turn out moderately well . 
The country stands before two distinct paths : uncontrolled and protracted civil violence , political crisis , and institutional collapse , or short-term tension , medium-term accommodation , and long-term stability . 
But can Bolivia move away from becoming a quasi-failed state ? 
The inauguration of Morales , an indigenous leader , was a political earthquake , but it was also a sign of deepening democracy . 
Restructuring relations between the state and the private sector in the hydrocarbons &quot; sector has provided the central government with the resources and capacities needed to rebuild an extremely weak state . 
Morales &apos;s social and cultural policies have been geared toward not only recognition of the rights of Bolivia &apos;s indigenous majority , but also bringing about a redistribution of power among racial groups . 
His initial radicalism was more symbolic and rhetorical than real , moderated by late 2007 , and most of his foreign policy initiatives were eclectic rather than extremist . 
If Morales had ever conceived a major revolutionary change in Bolivia , by early 2008 that project had dissipated , owing to the absence of a national consensus on the feasibility , intensity , and direction of such a transformation . 
The muddled results of a Constituent Assembly that Morales had convened to amend the constitution reflected this reality . 
In the meantime , the opposition , although strong and immoderate , is not yet secessionist . 
Fortunately , the world economy is not exacerbating Bolivia &apos;s domestic polarization . 
High global commodity prices have helped all the country &apos;s major economic sectors : mining business in the west , agro-industrial production and hydrocarbon projects in the east , and further oil and gas development in the south . 
Moreover , boom in global consumption of cocaine - owing to higher demand in Europe and Latin America , together with stable demand in the United States - has brought new income to some Bolivians . 
But , while the relative power of Bolivia &apos;s diverse regions is increasing , none can survive alone or veto the actions of highly mobilized zones of the country . 
Ethnic and social groups , activated by an intense , politicized agenda , may think in zero-sum terms , but they cannot advance their interests without positive-sum compromises . 
Moreover , neighboring countries such as Argentina and Brazil have shown a remarkable degree of understanding for Bolivia &apos;s domestic predicament . 
They have sought to avoid , wherever possible , economic or political disputes with Morales &apos;s government , and have become more diligent about exerting a positive influence on Bolivian affairs . 
The recently established &quot; Group of Friends &quot; ( Argentina , Brazil , and Colombia ) is trying to promote confidence-building and conflict-prevention measures . 
In addition , the US appears to be seeking to avoid open antagonism with Morales . 
With a reformist regime in La Paz , it is difficult not to expect tensions with the Bush administration . 
But , crucially , the US has refrained from intervention in Bolivian politics , because it understands that undermining the current government could lead to chaos . 
Bolivia &apos;s future is not inexorably bleak . 
There is a window of opportunity to rebuild its state and institutions in more viable forms . 
More democracy and material welfare probably can co-exist with realistic local autonomy , whereas partition , it should be remembered , does not always breed political pluralism , social cohesion , and economic well-being . 
Bolivians must recognize that there is a real chance to avoid this risky course .
