The Global Trust Deficit 
NEW YORK - In their preoccupation with fiscal deficits , developed-country policymakers continue to neglect a different , yet equally critical , shortfall : the trust deficit between advanced and emerging economies when it comes to global governance . 
For decades , developed-country shareholders at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank used loan conditionality to spur economic reforms - often including contentious fiscal-austerity measures - in the so-called Third World . 
Through pragmatic , sustained reform efforts , countries like Brazil , China , and India turned their economies around to achieve stunning increases in GDP growth - from an average annual rate of 3.5 % in 1980-1994 to 5.5 % since then . 
But , although developing countries now account for more than half of global GDP growth , advanced countries have yet to admit them to leadership roles that reflect their growing influence in the world economy . 
The failure so far of the US Congress to ratify the IMF reform package agreed to by G-20 finance ministers and central-bank governors in 2010 is the latest breach of trust - one that makes the promise of adequate representation for emerging economies seem like a shell game . 
America &apos;s unwillingness or inability to ratify the package - which includes doubling the IMF &apos;s funding quota and shifting 6 % of the new total , together with two directorships , to developing countries - undoubtedly contributed to the decision by the BRICS ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) to establish their own development bank . 
In fact , a backlash against Western hegemony in global governance has been brewing for years , with developing countries increasingly turning away from the IMF in favor of creating alternative , regional sources of funding . 
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , together with China , Japan , and South Korea , established the Chiang Mai Initiative in 2000 , and Latin American countries launched negotiations on the Banco del Sur in 2006 . 
The accelerating erosion of emerging economies &quot; trust in the Bretton Woods institutions is particularly problematic now , given slow growth and continued economic weakness in advanced countries . 
While the world economy is expected to grow by 3.3 % this year , average annual growth in the advanced countries is projected to be just 1.2 % . 
Developed and developing countries alike would benefit from greater economic-policy coordination . 
While regional groups may obtain some short-run benefits by pursuing narrower interests outside of multilateral channels , neither emerging nor advanced economies can fulfill their long-run potential in an environment characterized by isolationism and a zero-sum mentality in areas like trade and exchange-rate policy . 
Policy coordination , however , depends on trust , and building trust requires advanced-country leaders to keep their promises and offer their developing-country counterparts opportunities for leadership . 
Instead , developed countries have been taking actions that compromise their legitimacy . 
For example , after spending decades encouraging developing countries to integrate their economies into the global market , advanced countries now balk at trade openness . 
Indeed , despite pledges not to erect trade barriers after the global economic crisis , more than 800 new protectionist measures were introduced from late 2008 through 2010 . 
G-8 countries , the supposed champions of the global free-trade agenda that dominates the World Trade Organization , accounted for the lion &apos;s share of these measures . 
Some question the leadership ability of the BRICS . 
But many emerging markets are already leading by example on important issues like the need to shift global financial flows from debt toward equity . 
Mexico , for example , recently adopted - ahead of schedule - the changes in capital requirements for banks recommended by the Third Basel Accord ( Basel III ) , in order to reduce leverage and increase stability . 
For too long , developed countries have clung to their outsize influence in the international financial institutions , even as their fiscal fitness has dwindled . 
By ignoring the advice that they so vehemently dispensed to the developing world , they brought the world economy to its knees . 
Now , they refuse to fulfill their promises of global cooperation . 
Leaders in developed and developing countries alike must deepen their commitment to economic reform and integration . 
But only by giving emerging economies a real voice in global governance - thereby reducing the trust deficit and restoring legitimacy to multilateral institutions - can the global economy reach its potential .
