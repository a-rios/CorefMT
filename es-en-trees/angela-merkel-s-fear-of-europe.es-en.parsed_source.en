Angela Merkel &apos;s Fear of Europe 
BERLIN - Ever since the global financial crisis erupted in September 2008 , the European Union has been in turmoil . 
On the one hand , the euro protected the eurozone , particularly Germany &apos;s export economy , from speculative attacks and the chaos of currency volatility . 
On the other hand , the second phase of the crisis mercilessly exposed the euro &apos;s Achilles heel : the absence of economic or financial unification within the eurozone . 
Rising tensions within the EU have been the inevitable result . 
Germany &apos;s actions throughout the crisis have been plainly contradictory . 
Rather than moving forward in the direction of an economic union , it reverted to a policy favoring national solutions . 
The contradictory stance of Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government was exacerbated by the transition from the grand coalition during her first term to the current conservative / liberal coalition . 
At that point , self-inflicted domestic political weakness collided with the fiscal constraints of the euro rescue . 
At first , Merkel had a hard time getting the Bundestag - and even the parties in her government - to approve the initial &quot; small &quot; rescue package for the euro , promising that Germany would not have to pay any more than that . 
By nightfall on the same day , however , she had to assent to the much larger â‚¬ 750 billion rescue package in order to prevent an EU-wide disaster . 
Merkel still hasn &apos;t figured out how to explain the consequences of the financial and euro crises to the German people . 
That is not only because she is a poor public speaker , but also because she herself does not seem to know how to resolve the contradictions between national solutions and European constraints . 
Her style of leadership , which has mostly consisted of taking a wait-and-see approach to issues , fits this uncertainty well . 
Only at the last moment , when it is clear where the majority lies , does she embrace a solution . 
Even when times were better , Merkel &apos;s passive political style allowed vacuums to form , which were filled by other political forces within her party . 
As a result , while Merkel may appear to be in charge of things in the EU these days , in reality she is no longer driving events , but rather being driven by them . 
Without regard for the political consequences , Merkel is trying to escape the specifically German contradiction between national solutions and European constraints by advocating a rigorous fiscal-consolidation program , severe punishment for non-compliance ( including loss of EU voting rights ) , and a trigger mechanism for member states that lag in meeting their obligations . 
In Berlin , the term for this is &quot; a Europe of stability and solidity . &quot; 
It is a credo for which Germany will have to pay dearly in the future . 
Merkel &apos;s proposals do not reflect a German strategy aimed at leading the EU through this crisis . 
Instead , they are largely a response to domestic political imperatives . 
Berlin is consumed not with the question of what Europe might need in this historical situation , and what Germany &apos;s role should be , but with fear - of the conservative and tabloid press , of further losses in state elections , and of the possibility that the German constitutional court will intervene and overturn the existing programs to contain the euro crisis . 
Merkel now feels the fatal consequences of her &quot; leadership without leading &quot; approach . 
One cannot shake the impression that the European soul of this government is devoured by angst . 
As for Germany &apos;s ability to assert itself , there is not much evidence of it , despite the vigorous rhetoric . 
At the latest meeting of the European Council of Ministers , Germany &apos;s &quot; Iron Chancellor &quot; hobbled home . 
It was French President Nicolas Sarkozy who , in the run-up to the last EU summit , called a halt to Merkel &apos;s attempt to introduce an automatic response to member states that violate the stability criteria . 
Her second sweeping proposal , the withdrawal of voting rights in the Council , was abandoned at the Council &apos;s recent meeting in Brussels . 
In fact , Merkel &apos;s &quot; triumph &quot; consisted of nothing more than a Council promise to &quot; review &quot; a change to the Lisbon Treaty - albeit a change below the level that might make referendums necessary . 
In simple language : forget about any punishment or automatic trigger mechanisms that might affect a country &apos;s sovereignty . 
What remains of the effort to prevent a repeat of the crisis are tightened EU controls on national budgets and , regarding the treaty change to be considered , the continuation of the rescue package ( which previously was due to expire in 2013 ) , probably under a different name . 
That is not much of a victory for Merkel . 
So , as Germans once again see their &quot; Iron Chancellor &quot; deliver butter-soft results , they are increasingly likely to trust those who warn that the government is being tricked into a &quot; transfer union &quot; that uses German money to finance handouts for fiscally lax EU members . 
Disagreement with this criticism is difficult , because the German federal system itself relies on transfers . 
The more the EU is forced by Germany to become a union rooted in &quot; stability , &quot; the more pressing it will become for eurozone countries that cannot conform to the new , stricter rules to receive some sort of financial compensation . 
It is , after all , unrealistic to assume that all members can profit to the same extent from this hard-line approach ; that is not achievable even among the 16 federal German states . 
With Merkel &apos;s active help , the eurozone is ( in effect ) moving towards becoming a transfer union : the stricter the new rules and the larger the interest-rate spreads among eurozone countries , the faster that will happen . 
At home , though , Merkel fears this debate like no other - a debate that the financial markets and the crisis in many European countries will ensure cannot be avoided . 
Faintheartedness comes at a price .
