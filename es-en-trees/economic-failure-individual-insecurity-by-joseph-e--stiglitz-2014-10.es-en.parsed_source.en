The Age of Vulnerability 
NEW YORK - Two new studies show , once again , the magnitude of the inequality problem plaguing the United States . 
The first , the US Census Bureau &apos;s annual income and poverty report , shows that , despite the economy &apos;s supposed recovery from the Great Recession , ordinary Americans &quot; incomes continue to stagnate . 
Median household income , adjusted for inflation , remains below its level a quarter-century ago . 
It used to be thought that America &apos;s greatest strength was not its military power , but an economic system that was the envy of the world . 
But why would others seek to emulate an economic model by which a large proportion - even a majority - of the population has seen their income stagnate while incomes at the top have soared ? 
A second study , the United Nations Development Program &apos;s Human Development Report 2014 , corroborates these findings . 
Every year , the UNDP publishes a ranking of countries by their Human Development Index ( HDI ) , which incorporates other dimensions of wellbeing besides income , including health and education . 
America ranks fifth according to HDI , below Norway , Australia , Switzerland , and the Netherlands . 
But when its score is adjusted for inequality , it drops 23 spots - among the largest such declines for any highly developed country . 
Indeed , the US falls below Greece and Slovakia , countries that people do not typically regard as role models or as competitors with the US at the top of the league tables . 
The UNDP report emphasizes another aspect of societal performance : vulnerability . 
It points out that while many countries succeeded in moving people out of poverty , the lives of many are still precarious . 
A small event - say , an illness in the family - can push them back into destitution . 
Downward mobility is a real threat , while upward mobility is limited . 
In the US , upward mobility is more myth than reality , whereas downward mobility and vulnerability is a widely shared experience . 
This is partly because of America &apos;s health-care system , which still leaves poor Americans in a precarious position , despite President Barack Obama &apos;s reforms . 
Those at the bottom are only a short step away from bankruptcy with all that that entails . 
Illness , divorce , or the loss of a job often is enough to push them over the brink . 
The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( or &quot; Obamacare &quot; ) was intended to ameliorate these threats - and there are strong indications that it is on its way to significantly reducing the number of uninsured Americans . 
But , partly owing to a Supreme Court decision and the obduracy of Republican governors and legislators , who in two dozen US states have refused to expand Medicaid ( insurance for the poor ) - even though the federal government pays almost the entire tab - 41 million Americans remain uninsured . 
When economic inequality translates into political inequality - as it has in large parts of the US - governments pay little attention to the needs of those at the bottom . 
Neither GDP nor HDI reflects changes over time or differences across countries in vulnerability . 
But in America and elsewhere , there has been a marked decrease in security . 
Those with jobs worry whether they will be able to keep them ; those without jobs worry whether they will get one . 
The recent economic downturn eviscerated the wealth of many . 
In the US , even after the stock-market recovery , median wealth fell more than 40 % from 2007 to 2013 . 
That means that many of the elderly and those approaching retirement worry about their standards of living . 
Millions of Americans have lost their homes ; millions more face the insecurity of knowing that they may lose theirs in the future . 
These insecurities are in addition to those that have long confronted Americans . 
In the country &apos;s inner cities , millions of young Hispanics and African-Americans face the insecurity of a dysfunctional and unfair police and judicial system ; crossing the path of a policeman who has had a bad night may lead to an unwarranted prison sentence - or worse . 
Europe has traditionally understood the importance of addressing vulnerability by providing a system of social protection . 
Europeans have recognized that good systems of social protection can even lead to improved overall economic performance , as individuals are more willing to take the risks that lead to higher economic growth . 
But in many parts of Europe today , high unemployment ( 12 % on average , 25 % in the worst-affected countries ) , combined with austerity-induced cutbacks in social protection , has resulted in unprecedented increases in vulnerability . 
The implication is that the decrease in societal wellbeing may be far larger than that indicated by conventional GDP measures - numbers that already are bleak enough , with most countries showing that real ( inflation-adjusted ) per capita income is lower today than before the crisis - a lost half-decade . 
The report by the International Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress ( which I chaired ) emphasized that GDP is not a good measure of how well an economy is performing . 
The US Census and UNDP reports remind us of the importance of this insight . 
Too much has already been sacrificed on the altar of GDP fetishism . 
Regardless of how fast GDP grows , an economic system that fails to deliver gains for most of its citizens , and in which a rising share of the population faces increasing insecurity , is , in a fundamental sense , a failed economic system . 
And policies , like austerity , that increase insecurity and lead to lower incomes and standards of living for large proportions of the population are , in a fundamental sense , flawed policies .
