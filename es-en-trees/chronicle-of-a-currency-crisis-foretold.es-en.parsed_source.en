Chronicle of a Currency Crisis Foretold 
CAMBRIDGE - The crisis in Greece and the debt problems in Spain and Portugal have exposed the euro &apos;s inherent flaws . No amount of financial guarantees - much less rhetorical reassurance - from the European Union can paper them over . 
After 11 years of smooth sailing since the euro &apos;s creation , the arrangement &apos;s fundamental problems have become glaringly obvious . 
The attempt to establish a single currency for 16 separate and quite different countries was bound to fail . 
The shift to a single currency meant that the individual member countries lost the ability to control monetary policy and interest rates in order to respond to national economic conditions . 
It also meant that each country &apos;s exchange rate could no longer respond to the cumulative effects of differences in productivity and global demand trends . 
In addition , the single currency weakens the market signals that would otherwise warn a country that its fiscal deficits were becoming excessive . 
And when a country with excessive fiscal deficits needs to raise taxes and cut government spending , as Greece clearly does now , the resulting contraction of GDP and employment cannot be reduced by a devaluation that increases exports and reduces imports . 
Why , then , is the United States able to operate with a single currency , despite major differences among its 50 states ? 
There are three key economic conditions - none of which exists in Europe - that allow the diverse US states to operate with a single currency : labor mobility , wage flexibility , and a central fiscal authority . 
When the textile and shoe industries in America &apos;s northeastern states died , workers moved to the West , where new industries were growing . 
The unemployed workers of Greece , Portugal , and Spain do not move to faster-growing regions of Europe because of differences in language , history , religion , union membership , etc . 
Moreover , wage flexibility meant that substantially slower wage growth in the states that lost industries helped to attract and retain other industries . 
The European Central Bank must set monetary policy for the eurozone as a whole , even if that policy is highly inappropriate for some member countries . 
When demand in Germany and France was quite weak early in the last decade , the ECB reduced interest rates sharply . 
That helped Germany and France , but it also inflated real-estate bubbles in Spain and Ireland . 
The recent collapse of those bubbles caused sharp downturns in economic activity and substantial increases in unemployment in both countries . 
The introduction of the euro , with its implication of a low common rate of inflation , caused sharp declines in interest rates in Greece and several other countries that had previously had high rates . 
Those countries succumbed to the resulting temptation to increase government borrowing , driving the ratio of government debt to GDP to more than 100 % in Greece and Italy . 
Until recently , the bond markets treated all euro sovereign debts as virtually equal , not raising interest rates on high-debt countries until the possibility of default became clear . 
The need for massive fiscal adjustment without any offsetting currency devaluation will now drive Greece and perhaps others to default on their government debt , probably through some kind of IMF-supported debt restructuring . 
The euro was promoted as necessary for free trade among the member countries under the slogan &quot; One Market , One Money . &quot; 
In reality , of course , a single currency or fixed exchange rate is not needed for trade to flourish . 
The US has annual trade turnover of more than $ 2 trillion , despite a flexible exchange rate that has seen sharp ups and downs in recent decades . 
The North American Free Trade area increased trade among Canada , Mexico , and the US , all of which have separately floating exchange rates . 
Japan , South Korea , and other major Asian trading countries have very flexible exchange rates . 
And , obviously , only 16 nations within the 27-member EU &apos;s free-trade area use the euro . 
Despite its problems , the euro is very likely to survive the current crisis . 
But not all of the eurozone &apos;s current members may be there a year from now . 
In retrospect , it is clear that some of the countries were allowed to join prematurely , when they still had massive budget deficits and high debt-to-GDP ratios . 
Moreover , some countries &quot; industrial composition and low rates of productivity growth mean that a fixed exchange rate would doom them to increasingly large trade deficits . 
For the rest , some mechanism of enhanced surveillance and control may be adopted to limit future fiscal deficits . 
But , even with a smaller group of member countries and some changes in budget procedures , the fundamental problems of forcing disparate countries to live with a single monetary policy and a single exchange rate will remain .
