The Science of Acupuncture 
Like many other traditional Chinese medicines , acupuncture has for many centuries been viewed suspiciously in the West . 
It seems to work , but how ? 
Is a scientific answer possible ? 
Most Chinese doctors and patients have , for example , long regarded acupuncture as an effective treatment for stroke , using it to improve motor , speech , and other functions that have been destroyed . 
One survey showed that 66 % of Chinese doctors use acupuncture routinely to treat the effects of stroke , with 63 % of the doctors surveyed believing it to be effective . 
Some 36 % of Chinese doctors think the effectiveness of acupuncture remains uncertain , perhaps because the scientific basis for it remains so new . 
Recently , however , systematic scientific studies of acupuncture &apos;s effects in such treatment has begun . 
Almost all trials on acupuncture as a treatment for stroke conducted within China have been positive . 
But another recent study done in the UK showed that research conducted in several countries was uniformly favorable to acupuncture as a treatment for the damage caused by stroke . 
Indeed , all the trials performed before June 1995 in China , Japan , Hong Kong , and Taiwan were deemed positive by the British researchers . 
The Cochrane Collaboration , an international non-profit organization providing healthcare information , conducted a systematic review of the benefits of acupuncture , including 14 trials , of which 10 were conducted in China , involving 1,208 patients . 
Acupuncture started within 30 days of stroke onset , with control groups receiving a placebo - sham acupuncture - or no treatment . 
Compared to patients who received sham acupuncture or no treatment , far fewer of those who received acupuncture died or became invalid within three months . 
After three months or more of treatment , the numbers rose even more significantly in favor of those treated by acupuncture . 
Oddly , when comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture , the statistical difference concerning death or the need for institutional care was small . 
Indeed , another analysis , including 14 randomized trials with 1,213 patients six months after a stroke , compared the effects of conventional stroke rehabilitation with and without acupuncture as a supplement . 
Acupuncture was found to have no additional effect on motor recovery , but a small positive effect on disability , which may be due to a true placebo effect , or to the varied quality of the trials . 
Indeed , the efficacy of acupuncture without stroke rehabilitation remains uncertain , mainly because of the poor quality of such studies - a problem that has affected most of trials undertaken so far . 
For example , many trials did not describe their method of measuring statistical relevance , and only called themselves &quot; randomized controlled trials . &quot; 
Only four trials , with 373 patients , could provide data on death or dependency ( becoming dependent on others for activities of daily living ) . 
And only three trials - all conducted in Europe - used sham acupuncture as a control , whereas no acupuncture trials controlled with placebos or sham acupuncture have been reported in China , owing to high cultural barriers . 
Part of the problem in China is choosing the patients to be studied . 
After all , patients come to hospitals that practice traditional Chinese medicine because they already believe in acupuncture and are likely to be using it to treat another illness . 
Getting such patients to accept being put into a control group where no acupuncture is applied is almost impossible . 
This difficulty makes random studies of the effects of acupuncture treatment on stroke patients particularly difficult in a traditional Chinese medicine hospital . 
More fundamentally , however , Chinese doctors who use traditional medicine argue that outcome measures of acupuncture as a treatment for stroke should be different from conventional measures used in Western trials , because the theory of acupuncture is different . 
But no one has yet specified what the appropriate outcome measures for acupuncture should be . 
A recent study conducted in China , including 862 patients who were between the second and tenth day after onset of acute stroke , is the largest truly randomized trial using death or dependency as the primary outcome . 
The patients were randomly allocated to an acupuncture group receiving acupuncture treatment plus routine treatment or a control group receiving routine treatment alone . 
The results will be reported after analysis of the trial data and could prove useful for therapy of stroke patients . 
At present , however , there is insufficient evidence for routine use of acupuncture in stroke . 
More high-quality trials are needed . 
We do know that acupuncture is a safe , inexpensive , widely accepted , and potentially effective therapy . 
Particularly at a time when standard rehabilitation is not available for most Chinese stroke patients , few will wait to try acupuncture until its role is confirmed or refuted by reliable evidence .
