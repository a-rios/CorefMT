Iran &apos;s Electoral Strategy 
WASHINGTON , DC - Negotiations over Iran &apos;s nuclear program have again hit a wall , but the country &apos;s Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , appears unconcerned . 
Indeed , Khamenei seems convinced that neither the United States nor Israel will attack its nuclear facilities - at least not before the US presidential election in November . 
Ironically , while Khamenei is no fan of democracy , he relies on the fact that his principal enemies are bound by democratic constraints . 
Khamenei controls Iran &apos;s nuclear program and its foreign policy , but the US and Israel must work to reach consensus not only within their respective political systems , but also with each other . 
Iran &apos;s leaders , who closely follow Israeli political debates , believe that Israel would not launch an assault on their nuclear facilities without America &apos;s full cooperation , because unilateral action would jeopardize Israel &apos;s relations with its most important strategic ally . 
Given that an Israeli offensive would need to be coordinated with the US , while an American assault would not require Israeli military support , Iran would consider both to be American attacks . 
But Iran &apos;s leaders remain skeptical of either scenario , despite America &apos;s official position that &quot; all options are on the table &quot; to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons capability . 
So far , they simply do not feel enough pressure to consider a compromise . 
In fact , Iran &apos;s leaders continue to deride Israel from afar , calling the country an &quot; insult to humanity , &quot; or a &quot; tumor &quot; in the region that must be eradicated . 
Meanwhile , Iran &apos;s citizens - including clergy in the holy city of Qom , near the Fordow nuclear facility - are deeply concerned about the consequences of an attack . 
Ayatollah Yousef Sanei , a former attorney general and a religious authority ( marja &quot; ) , has asked the government to refrain from provoking Israel . 
Indeed , critics of the government believe that its incendiary rhetoric might lead to a devastating war . 
In fact , anti-Israel rhetoric reflects Iranian leaders &quot; confidence that Israel will not attack - a view that is bolstered by the situation in Syria . 
They are convinced that , even if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime falls , Iran will be able to destabilize the country in such a way that would pose a major security threat to Israel . 
According to this view , it is Israel that has an interest in refraining from further antagonizing Iran , not vice versa . 
Recent editorials in Kayhan - the hardline Iranian newspaper that serves as a mouthpiece for the Supreme Leader - indicate that Khamenei is looking forward to the US presidential election . 
A victory by Obama would reinforce America &apos;s unwillingness to attack Iran and renewed efforts to rein in Israel . 
That said , since the Islamic Republic &apos;s emergence in 1979 , Iran &apos;s leaders have generally preferred Republican presidents to Democrats : despite their harsh rhetoric , Republicans have been more willing to engage with Iran in practice . 
Indeed , given that Iran has so far survived severe international sanctions , its leaders believe that they could get an offer from the US after the election - particularly if Romney wins - that recognizes their right to enrich uranium . 
In fact , it is far from certain that Iran will be able to withstand current sanctions-related pressures indefinitely . 
But its leaders &quot; confidence that they can remains a crucial element of their strategy , and the West cannot afford to ignore their perceptions . America , whether led by Obama or Romney , must understand that Iran will not negotiate seriously on its nuclear program until it perceives a clear , convincing , and unified consensus in the US and Israel on an approach that addresses both Iran &apos;s ambitions and Israel &apos;s concerns . 
Achieving such a consensus in the context of an American presidential election will be no small feat .
