Can Developing Countries Carry the World Economy ? 
CAMBRIDGE - In the early days of the global financial crisis , there was some optimism that developing countries would avoid the downturn that advanced industrial countries experienced . 
After all , this time it was not they that had engaged in financial excess , and their economic fundamentals looked strong . 
But these hopes were dashed as international lending dried up and trade collapsed , sending developing countries down the same spiral that industrial nations took . 
But international trade and finance have both revived , and now we hear an even more ambitious version of the scenario . 
Developing countries , it is said , are headed for strong growth , regardless of the doom and gloom that has returned to Europe and the United States . 
More strikingly , many now expect the developing world to become the growth engine of the global economy . 
Otaviano Canuto , a World Bank vice president , and his collaborators have just produced a long report that makes the case for this optimistic prognosis . 
There are many reasons why such optimism is not unreasonable . 
Most developing countries have cleaned up their financial and fiscal houses and do not carry high debt . 
Governance is generally improving along with the quality of policymaking . 
The possibilities of technology transfer through participation in international production networks are greater than ever . 
Moreover , slow growth in the advanced economies need not exert a drag on developing countries &quot; performance . 
Long-term growth depends not on foreign demand , but on domestic supply . 
Sustained rapid growth is the result of poorer countries catching up to rich countries &quot; productivity levels - not of growth in the rich countries themselves . 
For most developing countries , this &quot; convergence gap &quot; is wider now than it has been at any time since the 1970 &quot; s . 
But the good news stops right about there . 
Sustained growth requires a growth strategy , and most developing countries do not yet have one that would put them irrevocably on the path of economic convergence . 
For too many of these countries , economic growth in the last two decades relied on a combination of two factors : a natural rebound from previous financial crises ( as in Latin America ) or political conflicts and civil war ( as in Africa ) , and high commodity prices . Neither can be relied on for the productive transformation that developing countries need . 
Consider , for example , Latin America &apos;s growth model of the last two decades . 
Global competition has whipped many of the region &apos;s industries into shape and fostered significant productivity gains in advanced sectors , but these gains have remained limited to a narrow segment of the economy . 
Worse still , labor has been displaced from more productive tradable activities ( in manufacturing ) to less productive informal activities ( services ) . 
In most Latin American countries , structural change has served to reduce rather than promote economic growth . 
Because Asian governments have tended to support their modern , tradable sectors to a greater extent , most Asian countries have managed to avoid this malady , and have done much better as a result . 
But even the Asian model may be reaching its limits . 
China , in particular , needs to confront the fact that the rest of the world will not allow it to run a huge trade surplus forever . 
An undervalued currency , which serves to subsidize China &apos;s manufacturing industries , has been a key driver of the country &apos;s economic growth for the last decade . 
A significant appreciation of the renminbi will reduce or even eliminate that growth subsidy . 
Regardless of developing countries &quot; growth prospects , there is a deeper question . 
Will a world economy in which developing countries have substantially greater weight foster the kind of global governance that sustains a hospitable economic environment ? 
Emerging-market economies have not yet shown the kind of global leadership that suggests an affirmative answer to this question . 
The global institutions of our day - the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , and the World Trade Organization - are still largely the creation of American leadership at the end of World War II ( though they have obviously undergone considerable change since then ) . 
These institutions reflected American interests , but they also codified certain norms of behavior - rule-based decision-making , non-discrimination , multilateralism , transparency - which eventually came to constrain American power as well . 
Countries like Brazil , China , India , and South Africa , however , have so far shown little interest in contributing to the construction of global regimes , preferring to remain free riders . 
Jorge Casta√±eda , a former foreign minister of Mexico , goes further , arguing that these countries have systematically opposed global rules , in areas ranging from climate change to international trade . 
Lest we be too harsh on developing countries , however , let us also remember that political scientists have long worried that greater diffusion of economic power would produce a less stable world economy . 
If the world economy &apos;s center of gravity shifts substantially toward developing countries , this will not be a smooth - and possibly not even a benign - process . 
We can be certain of two things : only those countries that adopt growth strategies based on stimulating domestic structural change will do well , and the conundrum of global governance - how to manage a world economy that has become unruly - will almost certainly get worse .
