Ivy League Investors 
Yale University , where I teach , has entrusted its endowment portfolio to one man , David Swensen , for over 20 years . 
During this period , the portfolio has grown from just over $ 1 billion to $ 18 billion - an average return of more than 16 % a year , which appears to be the highest of any major university . 
And it shows no signs of diminishing : in the latest fiscal year ending in June , the return was 22.9 % . 
Presidents of Yale have come and gone , but Swensen stays on . 
He has done more for the university than any president , or anyone else . 
In a university , ideas count more than money , but $ 18 billion dollars can create an environment for many new ideas . 
With 11,500 students , that is more than $ 1.5 million per student ( not including the university &apos;s buildings and art collection , each worth many billions of dollars more ) . 
How did this happen ? 
How did Swensen make so much money ? 
Everyone is wondering - not least those of us at Yale . 
After all , many people here have been teaching the &quot; efficient markets hypothesis &quot; that financial markets around the world have become so competitive that it is impossible to make more than a normal return from investing . 
Anyone who beats the market must simply be lucky . 
Studies seem to confirm this . 
For example , a 2004 study by Brad Barber and Terrance Odean of the University of California and Yi-Tsung Lee and Yiu-Jane Liu at National Chengchi University acquired trade-by-trade data on individual day traders on the Taiwan Stock Exchange . 
The study found that only the top 1 % of day traders made a profit - after deducting trading costs - in two consecutive six-month periods , and the median profit was hardly worth the effort : only about US $ 4000 . 
It is easy to conclude that there is just no point in even trying to beat the market . 
But then one remembers people like Swensen . 
Can his consistent performance really be attributed to luck ? 
Robert Kiyosaki , author of the Rich Dad , Poor Dad series of popular investment books , bases his books &quot; titles and themes on a comparison of his own highly-educated father with his friend &apos;s father , an eighth-grade dropout . 
According to Kiyosaki , his poor but scholarly dad tended to be pessimistic about one &apos;s ability to achieve anything in the real world , so he discouraged his son from even trying . 
By contrast , the friend &apos;s dad relished trying to achieve something big . 
Is it just a coincidence that he was rich ? 
Kiyosaki may try too hard to be inspirational , but I often think of him when I hear finance professors opine on the efficiency of markets and the futility of making money by trading in them . 
Maybe many academics find it difficult to take the initiative to achieve in the real world - I have yet to meet another professor who has mentioned having read Kiyosaki . 
But Swensen is an academic , with a Ph.D. in economics . 
He is surrounded by academics . 
Somehow , all this talk about efficient markets has not discouraged him from trying , and succeeding . 
There seems to be a pattern . 
Two similar universities , Harvard and Princeton , have had nearly the same success . 
The Harvard endowment , under Jack Meyer , earned a 15.2 % average annual return over the last ten years , compared to Swensen &apos;s 17.2 % average , while the Princeton endowment , under Andrew Golden , earned an average of 15.6 % per year . 
In fact , Golden worked under Swensen at Yale from 1988 until 1993 . 
Swensen has written two books about investing , one for professionals and one for the general public . 
I did not come away from reading them with a feeling that I know how to do what he did . 
But a couple of things stand out . 
One is his long-term focus . 
Yale lets Swensen invest for the very long term , and does not bother him about quarterly performance . 
Maybe this allows him to focus more on long-term fundamentals - and thus to make investments that may not perform well in the short run . 
But , in fact , he has done consistently well in both the short term and the long term . 
Part of the reason for Swensen &apos;s success is &quot; absolute return , &quot; a term - now widely quoted in the investment community - that he coined for unusual investment strategies involving such things as merger arbitrage and distressed securities . 
He also has invested in non-traditional asset classes , including real estate , oil , timber , private equity , and venture capital and buyout firms . 
These assets are generally not followed by multiple analysts , and are not easily understood , giving him a greater advantage in applying his intellectual skills and the skills of others around him . 
In these senses , Swensen is completely different from day traders , who are both investing for the short term and trying to beat the most crowded market - the market for exchange-listed securities . 
But I also think that the phenomenal success of Swensen and others like him reflects the environment that Kiyosaki criticizes . 
The problem is a defeatist attitude , not scholarship . 
When an analytical mind , a mind that is trained to search rigorously for the truth and as part of a community of such people is set free from self-doubt , it can do amazing things . 
Knowing David Swensen , I can attest that he is not a lonely day trader trying to beat the market . 
He is a good listener , is supportive of people he trusts , and is surrounded by a lot of good people with a wide array of skills . 
And he is certainly not a defeatist .
