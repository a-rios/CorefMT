The Ethics of Eating 
Global meat consumption is predicted to double by 2020 . 
Yet in Europe and North America , there is growing concern about the ethics of the way meat and eggs are produced . 
The consumption of veal has fallen sharply since it became widely known that to produce so-called &quot; white &quot; - actually pale pink - veal , newborn calves are separated from their mothers , deliberately made anemic , denied roughage , and kept in stalls so narrow that they cannot walk or turn around . 
In Europe , mad cow disease shocked many people , not only because it shattered beef &apos;s image as a safe and healthy food , but also because they learned that the disease was caused by feeding cattle the brains and nerve tissue of sheep . 
People who naively believed that cows ate grass discovered that beef cattle in feed lots may be fed anything from corn to fish meal , chicken litter ( complete with chicken droppings ) , and slaughterhouse waste . 
Concern about how we treat farm animals is far from being limited to the small percentage of people who are vegetarians or even vegans - eating no animal products at all . 
Despite strong ethical arguments for vegetarianism , it is not yet a mainstream position . 
More common is the view that we are justified in eating meat , as long as the animals have a decent life before they are killed . 
The problem , as Jim Mason and I describe in our recent book , The Way We Eat , is that industrial agriculture denies animals even a minimally decent life . 
Tens of billions of chickens produced today never go outdoors . 
They are bred to have voracious appetites and gain weight as fast as possible , then reared in sheds that can hold more than 20,000 birds . 
The level of ammonia in the air from their accumulated droppings stings the eye and hurts the lungs . 
Slaughtered at only 45 days old , their immature bones can hardly bear the weight of their bodies . 
Some collapse and , unable to reach food or water , soon die , their fate irrelevant to the economics of the enterprise as a whole . 
Conditions are , if anything , even worse for laying hens crammed into wire cages so small that even if there were just one per cage , she would be unable to stretch her wings . 
But there are usually at least four hens per cage , and often more . 
Under such crowded conditions , the more dominant , aggressive birds are likely to peck to death the weaker hens in the cage . 
To prevent this , producers sear off all birds &quot; beaks with a hot blade . 
A hen &apos;s beak is full of nerve tissue - it is , after all , her principal means of relating to her environment - but no anesthetic or analgesic is used to relieve the pain . 
Pigs may be the most intelligent and sensitive of the animals that we commonly eat . 
When foraging in a rural village , they can exercise that intelligence and explore their varied environment . 
Before they give birth , sows use straw or leaves and twigs to build a comfortable and safe nest in which to nurse their litter . 
But in today &apos;s factory farms , pregnant sows are kept in crates so narrow that they cannot turn around , or even walk more than a step forward or backward . 
They lie on bare concrete without straw or any other form of bedding . 
The piglets are taken from the sow as soon as possible , so that she can be made pregnant again , but they never leave the shed until they are taken to slaughter . 
Defenders of these production methods argue that they are a regrettable but necessary response to a growing population &apos;s demand for food . 
On the contrary , when we confine animals in factory farms , we have to grow food for them . 
The animals burn up most of that food &apos;s energy just to breathe and keep their bodies warm , so we end up with a small fraction - usually no more than one-third and sometimes as little as one-tenth - of the food value that we feed them . 
By contrast , cows grazing on pasture eat food that we cannot digest , which means that they add to the amount of food available to us . 
It is tragic that countries like China and India , as they become more prosperous , are copying Western methods and putting animals in huge industrial farms to supply more meat and eggs for their growing middle classes . 
If this continues , the result will be animal suffering on an even greater scale than now exists in the West , as well as more environmental damage and a rise in heart disease and cancers of the digestive system . 
It will also be grossly inefficient . 
As consumers , we have the power - and the moral obligation - to refuse to support farming methods that are cruel to animals and bad for us .
