Central Asia &apos;s Other Turkmenbashis 
A dictator &apos;s sudden death almost always triggers political instability . 
But it is doubly dangerous when it poses a risk of region-wide destabilization and a scramble for influence among the world &apos;s greatest military powers - the United States , Russia , and China . 
The sudden death in late December of Saparmurat Niyazov , Turkmenistan &apos;s authoritarian president-for-life who declared himself &quot; Turkmenbashi &quot; ( Leader of all Turkmens ) , jeopardizes stability in a country that is an increasingly important supplier of energy to Europe . 
Worse , given the absence of a clearly designated successor and the weakness of civil society and other political institutions , his death could have repercussions across Central Asia . 
Indeed , Niyazov &apos;s demise highlights the broader problems of Central Asia &apos;s post-Soviet regimes , which , with the exception of Kyrgyzstan , are run by Soviet-era bosses who , while not nearly as eccentric or egomaniacal as Niyazov , tolerate little dissent or opposition . 
Most of them are old , some of them are unwell . 
So , in the next few years , Central Asia will face leadership change on many fronts , with security apparatuses - which , as in Turkmenistan , have been crucial to buttressing these countries &quot; regimes - likely to be important players . 
How these transitions turn out will matter for several reasons . 
First , Central Asia is an important source of energy . 
The Caspian region accounts for 2 % to 3 % of the world &apos;s known oil resources - about equal to that of North Sea oil . 
While far smaller than the deposits in Saudi Arabia or Iran , Caspian oil could prove important if oil production falls or is reduced for political reasons elsewhere . 
Much of this Caspian oil is in Kazakhstan , giving that country a critical role in the regional energy market . 
Moreover , Kazakhstan &apos;s strategic importance has increased as a result of recent revelations that the country &apos;s Kashagan oil field will produce 25 % more than initially expected at peak production . 
Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are also major exporters of natural gas . 
Russia depends heavily on Turkmen gas for domestic consumption and export abroad , which could prove vital as demand rises over the next decade . 
Second , Central Asia &apos;s leadership transitions could tempt outside powers to exploit the resulting instability and spark a struggle for influence . 
Because the region was part of both the Soviet Union and the Russian empire , President Vladimir Putin &apos;s Kremlin regards it as part of Russia &apos;s natural sphere of influence . 
Putin &apos;s efforts to transform Russia into a major energy power and use energy as a tool of Russian foreign policy make the region all the more strategically significant . 
Moreover , China has sought to improve trade and transit ties with Central Asia over the last decade , reflecting its growing interests there . 
Not only is the region important for meeting China &apos;s growing energy needs , but the Chinese authorities also are concerned about separatist pressures among the Uighur population in Xinjiang province and the impact of ties with Uighurs in neighboring Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan . 
Like Russia , China wants a reduction of the US military presence in Central Asia . 
Both powers have sought to use the Shanghai Cooperation Organization - a regional grouping that includes Russia , China , Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , and Tajikistan - as a vehicle to pressure the US to withdraw its military forces from the region . 
However , this cooperation represents a short-term , tactical marriage of convenience rather than a budding new strategic alliance . 
In the long run , Russia and China are likely to be rivals for power and influence in Central Asia . 
Iran could also view the transitions in Central Asia as an opportunity to expand its regional influence , particularly given its close ethnic and cultural ties with Tajikistan and its long border with Turkmenistan . 
And , like China and Russia , Iran has no desire to see the US fill any security vacuum that could emerge as a result of leadership changes in Central Asia . 
Pakistan and India - especially the latter - will also watch carefully how the transitions play out . 
Both countries have growing strategic interests in the region . 
Like China , India views Central Asia as an important future energy supplier . 
As a result , India has quietly begun to strengthen its military ties to countries in the region , particularly Tajikistan , where it has a small base . 
Finally , the transitions in Central Asia could have a strong impact on US interests . 
As long as the US remains involved militarily in Afghanistan , access to facilities in Central Asia will remain important . 
With the loss of the use of the base at Karshi-Khanabad in Uzbekistan , access to Manas airfield in Kyrgyzstan has become the main means of re-supplying US troops in Afghanistan from Central Asia . 
However , the political situation in Kyrgyzstan is far from stable . 
Discontent with President Kurmanbek Bakiyev &apos;s rule is rising . 
A leadership change or increased Russian and Chinese pressure on Kyrgyz leaders could precipitate calls for a renegotiation of the agreement regarding access to Manas - or even demands for its termination altogether . 
In the nineteenth century , the struggle for mastery in Central Asia between the Russian and British empires was called &quot; The Great Game . &quot; 
Today , there are many more players involved , and the stakes - energy security , above all - are far higher now . 
America , India , Europe , and Japan will face increasing tension between their short-term military needs in the region and their long-term goal of promoting political reform in order to create more stable and reliable partners . 
Indeed , the key challenge in the years ahead will be to find the proper balance between these two objectives . 
Given the prospect of further leadership changes and increasing instability , meeting that challenge has never been more important .
