Parallels to 1937 
NEW HAVEN - The depression that followed the stock-market crash of 1929 took a turn for the worse eight years later , and recovery came only with the enormous economic stimulus provided by World War II , a conflict that cost more than 60 million lives . 
By the time recovery finally arrived , much of Europe and Asia lay in ruins . 
The current world situation is not nearly so dire , but there are parallels , particularly to 1937 . 
Now , as then , people have been disappointed for a long time , and many are despairing . 
They are becoming more fearful for their long-term economic future . 
For example , the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on the Ukrainian and Russian economies might ultimately be behind the recent war there . 
According to the International Monetary Fund , both Ukraine and Russia experienced spectacular growth from 2002 to 2007 : over those five years , real per capita GDP rose 52 % in Ukraine and 46 % in Russia . 
That is history now : real per capita GDP growth was only 0.2 % last year in Ukraine , and only 1.3 % in Russia . 
The discontent generated by such disappointment may help to explain Ukrainian separatists &quot; anger , Russians &quot; discontent , and Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s decision to annex Crimea and to support the separatists . 
There is a name for the despair that has been driving discontent - and not only in Russia and Ukraine - since the financial crisis . 
That name is the &quot; new normal , &quot; referring to long-term diminished prospects for economic growth , a term popularized by Bill Gross , a founder of bond giant PIMCO . 
The despair felt after 1937 led to the emergence of similar new terms then , too . 
&quot; Secular stagnation , &quot; referring to long-term economic malaise , is one example . 
The word secular comes from the Latin saeculum , meaning a generation or a century . 
The word stagnation suggests a swamp , implying a breeding ground for virulent dangers . 
In the late 1930s , people were also worrying about discontent in Europe , which had already powered the rise of Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini . 
The other term that suddenly became prominent around 1937 was &quot; underconsumptionism &quot; - the theory that fearful people may want to save too much for difficult times ahead . 
Moreover , the amount of saving that people desire exceeds the available investment opportunities . 
As a result , the desire to save will not add to aggregate saving to start new businesses , construct and sell new buildings , and so forth . 
Though investors may bid up prices of existing capital assets , their attempts to save only slow down the economy . 
&quot; Secular stagnation &quot; and &quot; underconsumptionism &quot; are terms that betray an underlying pessimism , which , by discouraging spending , not only reinforces a weak economy , but also generates anger , intolerance , and a potential for violence . 
In his magnum opus The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth , Benjamin M. Friedman showed many examples of declining economic growth giving rise - with variable and sometimes long lags - to intolerance , aggressive nationalism , and war . 
He concluded that , &quot; The value of a rising standard of living lies not just in the concrete improvements it brings to how individuals live but in how it shapes the social , political , and ultimately the moral character of a people . &quot; 
Some will doubt the importance of economic growth . 
Maybe , many say , we are too ambitious and ought to enjoy a higher quality of life with more leisure . 
Maybe they are right . 
But the real issue is self-esteem and the social-comparison processes that psychologist Leon Festinger observed as a universal human trait . 
Though many will deny it , we are always comparing ourselves with others , and hoping to climb the social ladder . 
People will never be happy with newfound opportunities for leisure if it seems to signal their failure relative to others . 
The hope that economic growth promotes peace and tolerance is based on people &apos;s tendency to compare themselves not just to others in the present , but also to what they remember of people - including themselves - in the past . 
According to Friedman , &quot; Obviously nothing can enable the majority of the population to be better off than everyone else . 
The downside of the sanctions imposed against Russia for its behavior in eastern Ukraine is that they may produce a recession throughout Europe and beyond . 
That will leave the world with unhappy Russians , unhappy Ukrainians , and unhappy Europeans whose sense of confidence and support for peaceful democratic institutions will weaken . 
While some kinds of sanctions against international aggression appear to be necessary , we must remain mindful of the risks associated with extreme or punishing measures . 
It would be highly desirable to come to an agreement to end the sanctions ; to integrate Russia ( and Ukraine ) more fully into the world economy ; and to couple these steps with expansionary economic policies . 
A satisfactory resolution of the current conflict requires nothing less .
