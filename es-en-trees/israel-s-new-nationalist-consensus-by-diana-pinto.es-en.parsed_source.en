Obama in Israel &apos;s New World 
PARIS - Now that Binyamin Netanyahu has formed a new Israeli government out of a dizzying kaleidoscope of possible post-election permutations , has the country &apos;s politics moved to the center ? 
US President Barack Obama would be wrong to think so as he prepares for his first official visit . 
The unexpected second-place finish of Yair Lapid &apos;s new Yesh Atid ( &quot; There is a Future &quot; ) party in the recent election has certainly changed the complexion of the government : the two leading Orthodox parties , Shas and United Torah Judaism , are out , while two smaller centrist parties , Kadima and Hatnua , are in . 
But those who breathed a sigh of relief at the weakening of Netanyahu &apos;s Likud and the country &apos;s extreme right-wing parties should be as anxious as ever . 
The political horse-trading is over for the time being , and the outcome seems assured . 
Netanyahu will return as Prime Minister , and every party - in power or not - is ready to block , dilute , or paper over whatever policies the new government manages to adopt . 
In Israel , the question nowadays is not whether the center will hold , but whether it matters . 
In both domestic and in international terms , Israel has not so much moved to the center as it has embraced a new type of national consensus that began to emerge in 2011 . 
In May-June of that year , while the international community was still mooting potential land swaps for an increasingly distant peace settlement with the Palestinians , Israelis were focusing on a domestic battle over the regulation of cottage cheese . 
The new consensus was best symbolized by the massive popular protests that erupted two months later , bringing together young , economically frustrated , mainly middle-class Israelis who might once have been politically divided by their allegiance to either the center-left Labor party or Netanyahu &apos;s Likud . 
No mention was made , then or now , of the need for peace initiatives ; of the state of mind of the now-invisible ( to Israeli eyes ) Palestinians , now relegated to their side of the security wall ; or of the growing inequalities that separate Israel &apos;s Arab citizens from their Jewish counterparts . 
By representing the aspirations of middle class Israelis seeking a better economic deal , Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett of the nationalist Jewish Home party became the two sides of a newly minted political coin , one backed by an inward-looking ethnic and national identity in a country that sees itself as alone in the world . 
This identity may be secular or religious ; it may seek middle-class normality or proclaim an Israeli version of manifest destiny - the two are not incompatible . 
Either way , the country no longer resonates with the expectations , hopes , and fears of a world still focused ( ever more dimly ) on resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
Nor does Israel listen to the anguish of its own Ciceronian Zionists , perhaps best represented by the novelist Amos Oz . 
Israel has simply stopped seeking to reconcile its Jewish identity with its commitment to democracy , for it has stopped addressing the contradiction that the Israeli-Palestinian question represents . 
Simply put , that contradiction is no longer relevant to the new Israel . 
Despite the deep economic frustrations of many of its middle-class citizens ( the truly indigent did not protest ) , Israel has become a global economic and military powerhouse . 
The country increasingly lives in its own virtual reality , simultaneously proximate to and far removed from the revolutionary pre-modernity of most of its neighbors . 
Indeed , Israel is now on an equal footing with all of the rising new powers of an increasingly globalized world . 
Few of them are democracies , and not one of them holds Israel to task for its settlement policies in the West Bank or cares , like the United States , about Middle East peace . 
Why should Israel continue to focus on a weakened West that is constantly reprimanding it when the rest of the world beckons ? 
Nor does the old secular / religious divide have much salience anymore . 
Israel has become post-modern , producing new - and sometimes startling - synergies among its avant-garde high-tech sensibility , its secular and ever more orthodox religious identities , and its overall ethno-nationalist outlook . 
Its ancient biblical past can now coexist seamlessly with its ultra-modern present . 
Israel &apos;s new millionaires can easily live in far-flung settlements in &quot; Judea and Samaria &quot; and commute daily to their coastal startups . 
And the army has already become the purview of nationalistic and religious cadres , even without conscription of the ultra-orthodox - one of the centrist camp &apos;s demands in pressing for fairer national burden-sharing . 
As a result , the Israeli state seems to be moving closer to its Asian counterparts , with their emphasis on economic innovation and their indifference to universal values or , for that matter , peace . 
Israel is now proud to be in a world of its own , in which it feels free to act unilaterally and scoff at toothless criticism from Europe ( and now partly from the US ) . 
There is no reason to believe that Netanyahu &apos;s new government will seek to revive the increasingly feeble and moribund peace process , beyond offering verbal promises and inconsequential half-measures . 
Nor should anyone expect a moratorium on settlement expansion . 
On the contrary , the settlements offer cheaper housing than is available in Israel , and thus resolve one of the main economic problems of the country &apos;s middle class . 
&quot; Red lines &quot; in Israel have a way of mutating into lines drawn in the sand , which are then rendered invisible at the slightest wind . 
The new government &apos;s fragile equilibrium only reinforces this sober interpretation . 
In Israel , Obama will encounter a country that has indeed moved , but not toward a missing center . 
It has moved into its own orbit .
