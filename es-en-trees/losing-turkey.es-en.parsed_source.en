Losing Turkey 
OXFORD  -  
But , since 2003 , Turkey &apos;s virtually unquestioned alliance with the United States has undergone a profound re-evaluation , due to the Iraq War , and the Turkish consensus on its decades-long EU candidacy has begun to wobble , owing to EU dithering . Given Turkey &apos;s central role not only in maintaining peace in the volatile Caucasus region but also in promoting peace in the Middle East - the talks now underway between Syria and Israel are , after all , being conducted with Turkish mediation - neglecting Turkey is not only foolish , it is dangerous . 
Both the dominant Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) and its secular rivals remain publicly committed to pursuing EU membership , but in practice doubts have emerged . 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s insistence that a referendum should be held on Turkey &apos;s admission suggests that years of painful adjustment to EU norms will never produce the payoff of membership . 
The US and the EU are evidently convinced that Turkey has nowhere else to go . 
The Turks , they think , will fatalistically accept any snub . 
But this cozy assumption overlooks a tectonic shift in Turkey &apos;s geo-political position . 
Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union , Turkey looked to the newly-independent central Asian states in a mood of pan-Turkic romanticism . 
These ancestral homelands exercised a hold on Turkish imaginations , but today it is business opportunities , energy resources , and other practical matters rather than ethnic unity that are creating a loose Turkic &quot; commonwealth . &quot; 
Most striking is Turkey &apos;s renewal of relations with Russia without damaging its ties to the newly independent post-Soviet states . 
Turkey &apos;s ancient antagonism toward Russia briefly revived when the Soviet Union imploded . 
In the early 1990 &quot; s , some Turkish generals saw the humiliation of Russian troops in Chechnya as part of a long-awaited revenge . 
But , while Russia ( and Iran ) were once Turkey &apos;s great geo-political rivals , today they are export markets and energy suppliers . 
Energy is the key to Turkey &apos;s new geo-political position . 
Its industry and population are growing dynamically , so its energy demands are producing geo-political synergy with Russia and Iran , neither of which can afford to cut the flow of oil and gas without provoking a massive internal crisis . 
Meanwhile , as Turkey &apos;s attitude toward its neighbors has changed , its governing elite has watched the EU embrace ex-communist countries with far shakier market economies and shorter democratic records . 
As one Turkish general put it , &quot; If we had joined the Warsaw Pact rather than NATO , we would be in the EU by now . &quot; 
Last summer &apos;s re-election of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan &apos;s AKP , followed by the election of Abdullah Gul as the first president whose wife wears a headscarf , seemed to confirm the fears of anti-Islamic Europeans . 
Yet , even if many AKP activists and voters are devout Muslims , Erdogan and Gul remain committed to European integration . 
Time is running out , however , for them to satisfy their supporters and silence their critics by achieving it . 
The problem is that the AKP &apos;s victories , together with America &apos;s courting of Erdogan and Gul , have triggered a crisis of direction among Turkey &apos;s once-dominant secular and pro-western elite . 
Even if the AKP can rely on the allegiance of millions of voters and swarms of new members anxious to join the winning side , the secularists are deeply entrenched in Turkey &apos;s institutions , universities , media , and business . 
But both ordinary AKP supporters and disillusioned secularists are now suspicious of America &apos;s actions and motives in the region . 
Key military figures &quot; tacit backing for the Turkish Parliament &apos;s refusal to endorse the March 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq suggests that Turkish nationalism could unite the AKP &apos;s rank-and-file MPs with their otherwise implacable foes in the secular camp . 
If the EU were to snub Turkey openly over membership , or if America were to seem too lax on the Kurdish problem in Northern Iraq , a huge swathe of the two camps could well unite . 
Turkey &apos;s links with Israel , for example , have been strained by Israeli investment in Kurdistan . 
While Shimon Peres made a gesture of reconciliation by choosing Ankara as the setting for the first speech by an Israeli president to the parliament of a predominantly Muslim country , Israel &apos;s concerns about Iran are far more serious than are Turkey &apos;s . 
Israel &apos;s two most irreconcilable enemies , Iran and Syria , are in fact among the most vocal supporters of Turkey &apos;s hard-line stance towards the Kurds . 
America &apos;s conquest of Iraq de-stabilized Turkey &apos;s Western orientation more than the US cares to admit . 
Most Turks don &apos;t want to see their country excluded from the West , but if the EU spurns them while speeding up entry for weaker candidates , Turkey may come to feel sufficiently strong and embittered to strike out on a new geo-political course .
