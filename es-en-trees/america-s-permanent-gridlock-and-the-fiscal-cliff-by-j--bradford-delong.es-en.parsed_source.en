America &apos;s Political Recession 
BERKELEY - The odds are now about 36 % that the United States will be in a recession next year . 
The reason is entirely political : partisan polarization has reached levels never before seen , threatening to send the US economy tumbling over the &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; - the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that will take effect at the beginning of 2013 unless Democrats and Republicans agree otherwise . 
More than a century ago , during the first Gilded Age , American politics was sharply polarized as well . 
In 1896 , future President Theodore Roosevelt was a Republican attack dog . 
He denounced Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan as a mere puppet of the sinister governor of Illinois , John Peter Altgeld . 
Bryan , Roosevelt said , &quot; would be as clay in the hands of the potter under the astute control of the ambitious and unscrupulous Illinois communist . &quot; 
The &quot; free coinage of silver &quot; would be &quot; but a step towards the general socialism which is the fundamental doctrine of his political belief . &quot; 
He and Altgeld &quot; seek to overturn the ... essential policies which have controlled the government since its foundation . &quot; 
Such language is as extreme as any we hear today - and from a man who was shortly to become Vice President ( and later President , following the assassination of William McKinley ) . 
We have heard Texas Governor Rick Perry call obliquely for the lynching of his fellow Republican , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , should he come to the Lone Star State . 
But neither Perry nor Kobach is likely ever to be a US president , whereas Theodore Roosevelt was more than a partisan . 
He was happy to make deals with Democrats - to put himself at the head not just of the Republican Party but of the bipartisan Progressive coalition , trying either to yoke the two forces together or to tack back and forth between them to achieve legislative and policy goals . 
Obama broadly follows Ronald Reagan &apos;s ( second-term ) security policy , George H.W. Bush &apos;s spending policy , Bill Clinton &apos;s tax policy , the bipartisan Squam Lake Group &apos;s financial-regulatory policy , Perry &apos;s immigration policy , John McCain &apos;s climate-change policy , and Mitt Romney &apos;s health-care policy ( at least when Romney was governor of Massachusetts ) . 
And yet he has gotten next to no Republicans to support their own policies . 
Likewise , he has been unable to get Republican Vice-Presidential candidate Paul Ryan to endorse his own Medicare cost-control proposals . 
There are obvious reasons for this . 
A large chunk of the Republican base , including many of the party &apos;s largest donors , believes that any Democratic president is an illegitimate enemy of America , so that whatever such an incumbent proposes must be wrong and thus should be thwarted . 
And the Republican cadres believe this of Obama even more than they believed it of Clinton . 
This view clearly influences Republican office-holders , who fear the partisan beast that mans their campaigns &quot; phone banks and holds the purse strings . 
Moreover , ever since Clinton &apos;s election in 1992 , those at the head of the Republican Party have believed that creating gridlock whenever a Democrat is in the White House , and thus demonstrating the government &apos;s incapacity to act , is their best path to electoral success . 
That was the Republicans &quot; calculation in 2011-2012 . 
Now , it is possible that Republican legislators may rebel against their leaders , arguing that they ran for office to govern , not to paralyze the government in the hope that doing so will give the party power to reign as it wishes after the next election . 
It is possible that Republican leaders like Representatives John Boehner and Eric Cantor and Senator Mitch McConnell will conclude that their policy of obstruction has been a failure . 
They might note that , although the economy remains deeply troubled and depressed in the aftermath of a financial crisis for which they set the stage , Obama &apos;s policies have been by far the most successful of those in any major advanced country , and conclude that he has been a relatively good president , and one worth supporting . 
But don &apos;t count on it . 
Right now , every senior politician in America is telling their favorites in the press that they are confident that compromise on the &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; will be reached before the end of December . 
It seems to me that the odds are around 60 % that real negotiation will not begin until tax rates go up on January 1 . 
Let us hope that it will be short and shallow .
