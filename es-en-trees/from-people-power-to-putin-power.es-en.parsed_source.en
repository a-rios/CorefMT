From People Power to Putin Power 
As I attended a small but dignified memorial ceremony in Paris last week in honor of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya - a woman &quot; brave beyond limits , &quot; in the words of her French editor - I was reminded of another posthumous tribute I participated in nearly 17 years ago in Moscow . 
Unlike Politkovskaya , the great scientist and human right activist Andrei Sakharov had not been murdered , and the tribute given to him then looked like the celebration of a new era . 
A new page was being turned , one that was full of uncertainty but also of hope that Russia was on its way to becoming a &quot; normal country . &quot; 
It is this page that has been probably fully closed with the assassination of Politkovskaya . 
What the small crowd of intellectuals gathered in Paris was mourning was their hope for a different Russia . 
We were burying the collective dream of intellectuals and democrats for a Russia where freedom and the rule of law would , after a long and cold Soviet winter , take root and bloom . 
The portraits of Politkovskaya , like a multitude of mirrors , were calling us back to a much darker reality . 
The dream was over . 
It had , most likely , never been realizable . 
What we are witnessing today is a totally different story . 
Russia is literally buying its way back into the international system as a preeminent actor , one that is regaining power and clout by replacing nuclear weapons with oil and gas and substituting greed for fear . 
The balance of terror of the Soviet era has given way to unilateral energy dependency in favor of Russia . 
With their enormous cash flow , Russian billionaires are buying sumptuous properties all over the world , and Russia is buying prominent Germans like the former Chancellor , Gerhard Schroeder , if not the support of Germany as such . 
Whatever the enormous differences that may separate them , post-communist Russia and fundamentalist Iran have much in common . 
Energy wealth gives them a sense of unique opportunity , the conviction that time is playing in their favor , and that they can now redress the humiliations they have suffered from the outside world . 
It is as if they were combining the Arab / Islamic world &apos;s culture of humiliation and Asia &apos;s culture of hope . 
Both are marked by a defiant nationalism , and both feel irresistible , all the more so because they sense that the United States is in decline as a result of the quagmire in Iraq , if not in Afghanistan as well . 
Of course , the differences between Russia and Iran are enormous . 
The Iranian regime is highly ideological and animated by an open passion to destroy Israel . 
It does not enjoy the massive backing of its society , except when it comes to national pride and the quest for nuclear status . 
Russia &apos;s regime , by contrast , is animated by money , not ideology . 
In its quest to rebuild Russia &apos;s geopolitical power and influence , Presdient Vladimir Putin has the support of the immense majority of the population . 
His motto , &quot; Get rich and keep quiet , &quot; sounds like Guizot &apos;s priorities in mid-nineteenth century France , even if it is &quot; seasoned &quot; with a strong touch of imperial pride . 
As long as the oil money keeps flowing , most Russians will express no nostalgia for the democratic opening of the Yeltsin years , with its accompanying combination of chaos , corruption , international weakness , and disrespect for the state . 
Are Russians so different from us in the western democratic world , or is democracy a luxury that only old , stable , prosperous , and satisfied societies can afford ? 
In their quest for post-Soviet stability , Russians seem to have found reassurance in Putin . 
He does not match Peter the Great in physical stature , but he has proven to be a gifted politician , capable of grasping , then controlling , the mood of the Russian people . 
For a majority of Russian citizens , economic prosperity and televised entertainment have become the modern equivalent of the panem et circenses formula of Roman times . 
The war in Chechnya may contribute to the moral corruption of Russia as a whole , to its frightening descent into a culture of violence . 
Meanwhile , ordinary Russians have gained little . 
The multiplication of assassinations of political opponents and economic rivals , the mafia practice of contract murders , cannot be seen as signs of a regained stability . 
Russia may have recovered its status as a strong power , but is it a respected , or even a happy one ? 
Russia is rich , but Russians , at least most of them , remain poor , with a life expectancy that is closer to Africa than to Western Europe . 
Eventually , they will have to recognize that modern nations cannot live by power alone .
