Europe &apos;s Zombie Banks 
BRUSSELS - What is wrong with Europe &apos;s banks ? 
The short answer is that the sector is too large , has too little capital , and contains too many players that lack a viable long-term business model . 
It is the combination of the last two factors - an overabundance of banks with no sustainable way to turn a profit - that constitutes the most serious and most difficult problem . 
The banking sector &apos;s size is a cause for concern because , with total liabilities amounting to more than 250 % of the eurozone &apos;s GDP , any major problem could over-burden public budgets . 
In short , the banking sector in Europe might be too big to be saved . 
Undercapitalization can be cured by an infusion of new equity . 
But the larger the banking sector , the more difficult this might become . 
More important , it makes no sense to put new capital into banks that cannot return profits for the foreseeable future . 
The difficulties in southern Europe are well known , but they differ fundamentally from country to country . 
In Spain , banks have historically issued 30-year mortgages whose interest rates are indexed to interbank rates such as Euribor , with a small spread ( often less than 100 basis points ) fixed for the lifetime of the mortgage . 
This was a profitable model when Spanish banks were able to refinance themselves at a spread much lower than 100 basis points . 
Today , however , Spanish banks - especially those most heavily engaged in domestic mortgage lending - must pay a much higher spread over interbank rates to secure new funding . 
Many local Spanish banks can thus stay afloat only because they refinance a large share of their mortgage book via the European Central Bank . 
But reliance on cheap central bank ( re ) financing does not represent a viable business model . 
In Italy , the difficulties arise from banks &quot; continued lending to domestic companies , especially small and medium-size enterprises ( SMEs ) , while GDP has stagnated . 
Even before the eurozone crisis erupted in 2010 , the productivity of capital investment in Italy was close to zero . 
The onset of the current recession in Europe has exposed this low productivity , with the failure of many SMEs leading to large losses for the banks , whose funding costs , meanwhile , have increased . 
It is thus difficult to see how Italian banks can return to profitability ( and how the country can resume economic growth ) unless the allocation of capital is changed radically . 
There are problems north of the Alps as well . 
In Germany , banks earn close to nothing on the hundreds of billions of euros of excess liquidity that they have deposited at the ECB . 
But their funding costs are not zero . 
German banks might be able to issue securities at very low rates , but these rates are still higher than what they earn on their ECB deposits . 
Moreover , they must maintain an extensive - and thus expensive - domestic retail network to collect the savings deposits from which they are not profiting . 
Of course , some banks will always do better than others , just as some will suffer more than others from negative trends . 
It is thus essential to analyze the situation of each bank separately . 
But it is clear that in an environment of slow growth , low interest rates , and high risk premia , many banks must struggle to survive . 
Unfortunately , the problem cannot be left to the markets . 
A bank without a viable business model does not shrink gradually and then disappear . 
Its share price might decline toward zero , but its retail customers will be blissfully unaware of its difficulties . 
Other creditors , too , will continue to provide financing , because they expect that the ( national ) authorities will intervene - either by providing emergency funding or by arranging a merger with another institution - before the bank fails . 
Recent official tough talk in the European Union about &quot; bailing in &quot; bank creditors has not impressed markets much , not least because the new rules on potentially imposing losses on creditors are supposed to enter into force only in 2018 . 
Starting next year , when it takes over authority for bank supervision , the ECB will review the quality of banks &quot; assets . 
But it will be unable to review the longer-term viability of banks &quot; business models . 
Current owners will resist to the end any dilution of their control ; and no national authority is likely to admit that their national &quot; champions &quot; lack a plausible path to financial viability . 
Keeping a weak banking system afloat has high economic costs . 
Banks with too little capital , or those without a viable business model , tend to continue lending to their existing customers , even if these loans are doubtful , and to restrict lending to new companies or projects . 
This misallocation of capital hampers any recovery and dims longer-term growth prospects . 
What should be done is clear enough : recapitalize much of the sector and restructure those parts without a viable business model . 
But this is unlikely to happen any time soon . 
Unfortunately , until it does , Europe is unlikely to recover fully from its current slump .
