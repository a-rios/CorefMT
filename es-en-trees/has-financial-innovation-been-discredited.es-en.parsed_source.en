Has Financial Innovation Been Discredited ? 
MOSCOW - Skeptics of financial liberalization and innovation have been emboldened by the crisis in the world &apos;s credit markets that erupted in mid-2007 , when the problems with sub-prime mortgages first appeared in the United States . 
Are these skeptics right ? 
Should we halt financial liberalization and innovation in order to prevent crises like the sub-prime disaster from recurring ? 
The entire sub-prime market is largely a decade-old innovation - the word &quot; sub-prime &quot; did not exist in any language before 1994 - built on such things as option adjustable-rate mortgages ( option-ARM &apos;s ) , new kinds of collateralized debt obligations , and structured investment vehicles . 
Previously , private investors in the US simply did not lend to mortgage seekers whose credit history was below prime . 
But , while it does sometimes appear that the current crisis is due , at least in part , to financial innovation , financial-market liberalization has been shown to be a good thing overall . 
A study published in 2005 by economists Geert Bekaert , Campbell Harvey , and Christian Lundblad found that when countries liberalize their stock markets , allowing them to operate freely without government intervention , economic growth rises by an average of one percentage point annually . 
The higher growth tends to be associated with an investment boom , which in turn seems to be propelled by the lower cost of capital for firms . 
Of course , while complicated financial arrangements allow us to move forward economically , they also can create hazards . 
Think of the scaffolding and equipment around construction sites . 
Sometimes people trip over the equipment , or a piece of scaffolding falls , with disastrous consequences . 
Any time you build something , there is always a chance of a setback . 
But , with every setback , we learn . 
Governments and insurance companies implement better safety requirements in response to construction accidents . 
The same is true , over time , with financial disasters . 
The US is one of the world &apos;s most financially liberal countries . 
Its financial markets &quot; high quality must be an important reason for America &apos;s relatively strong economic growth . 
Indeed , given a very low savings rate and high fiscal deficit over the past few decades , the US might otherwise have faced economic disaster . 
The reason is simple . 
Individual firms might have splendid investment opportunities - to enlarge plant and equipment , capitalize on new software , or exploit new research and new training of key personnel - but might be deterred by cash shortages or perceived macroeconomic risks . 
Effective financial markets enable them to pursue such opportunities despite these constraints by enlisting investors to provide the capital . 
These investors can , in turn , be encouraged when financial hedging devices and financial diversification protect them . 
There has been a longstanding discussion about whether new derivative markets , which provide such financial hedging , tend to increase preexisting financial markets &quot; volatility . 
The consensus is that they do not . 
In 2000 , Stewart Mayhew , Assistant Chief Economist at the US Securities and Exchange Commission &apos;s Office of Economic Analysis , surveyed the extensive literature on this topic . 
Mayhew concluded that it is rather difficult to tell whether derivative markets worsen financial-market volatility , because their creation tends to come when existing financial markets already are more volatile , or can be predicted to become so . 
Moreover , he found that there is no evidence that derivative markets create volatility in underlying cash markets ; in fact , they may even reduce it . 
The effect on underlying financial markets &quot; volatility may not even be the right question to consider in deciding whether to permit new derivative products . 
The right question is whether these products are conducive to economic success and growth . 
Here , Mayhew concludes that new derivative markets clearly increase the liquidity and quality of information in existing financial markets . 
And it is this liquidity and quality of information that ultimately propels economic growth . 
The sub-prime crisis has exposed serious problems that we must address . 
For example , we need stronger consumer protection for retail financial products , stricter disclosure requirements for new securities , and better-designed vehicles for hedging risks . 
Some of the innovations associated with the sub-prime crisis - notably option-ARM &apos;s , when extended to borrowers who couldn &apos;t handle them - seem to have little redeeming value . 
But others - those involved with the securitization of mortgages - were clearly important long-run innovations , because they can help spread risks better around the world . 
So , we should not slow down financial innovation in general . 
On the contrary , some of the fixes that result from the sub-prime crisis will probably take the form of still more innovation , further increasing the sophistication of our financial markets .
