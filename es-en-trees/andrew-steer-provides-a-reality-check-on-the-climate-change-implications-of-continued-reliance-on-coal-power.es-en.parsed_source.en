King Coal &apos;s Climate Challenge 
WASHINGTON , DC - Coal is emerging as a major topic of conversation at the United Nations climate-change negotiations currently taking place in Warsaw - and rightly so . 
Indeed , it is a discussion that the world needs to have . 
The latest findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change conclude that we are quickly using up our carbon &quot; budget &quot; - the amount of carbon that we can afford to emit while still having a good chance of limiting global warming to 2º Celsius . 
According to the IPCC , keeping the global temperature increase from pre-industrial levels below this threshold - the recognized tipping point beyond which climate change is likely to get seriously out of control - requires that the world emit only about 1,000 gigatonnes of carbon ( GtC ) . 
More than half of this amount was already emitted by 2011 . 
Unless we shift away from carbon-intensive behavior , the remaining budget will run out in roughly three decades . 
When it comes to tolerable CO2 emissions , coal is the budget buster . 
Just this week , a group of 27 prominent scientists , representing all major continents , issued a joint statement that explains that burning all known fossil-fuel reserves would produce about 3,800 gigatonnes of CO2 , or 1,053 GtC , with coal alone accounting for more than half . 
Simply put , if the world burns its known coal reserves using current technologies , it is likely to push global temperature rise far beyond 2ºC . 
Many governments and financial institutions recognize this . 
In recent months , the World Bank , the European Investment Bank , and the United States Export-Import Bank have introduced policies that restrict financing of new coal-fired power plants unless they can capture and store their CO2 emissions . 
Five Nordic countries have joined the US Treasury in ending public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas , and others may soon follow suit . 
And this fall , the US Environmental Protection Agency proposed emissions standards for new power plants that would rule out conventional coal power - an important step that would cut carbon pollution and drive innovation . 
Likewise , China , concerned about the serious health costs linked to burning coal , is prohibiting new coal capacity in three coastal provinces under its newly adopted action plan on air pollution . 
The Chinese authorities have also introduced policies to reduce the proportion of coal in the country &apos;s overall energy mix . 
Against this backdrop , the World Coal Association ( WCA ) is meeting this week , also in Warsaw - in fact , just across the river from where negotiators are trying to forge the building blocks of a global climate agreement by 2015 . 
The WCA is calling for the use of &quot; high-efficiency , low-emissions coal-combustion technologies &quot; to lower greenhouse-gas emissions from coal-fired power plants around the world . 
Even the most modern and advanced conventional coal-fired power plants emit over 15 times more CO2 per unit of electricity than renewable energy systems , and more than twice the amount of efficient gas-fired power stations . 
And yet coal power is still going strong globally . 
The World Resources Institute estimates that there are close to 1,200 proposed coal-fired power projects around the world , with a total installed capacity of more than 1,400 gigawatts . 
If built , the world would commit a large share of the remaining carbon budget to high-carbon infrastructure with a lifespan of 40-50 years . 
According to the International Energy Agency , the current trend in coal use is in line with a scenario that would lead to a 6ºC temperature rise . 
This is a future that would radically and irreversibly change life on earth as we know it . 
This is why the OECD Secretary General has suggested that it is time for a moratorium on the construction of conventional coal-fired power plants . 
Governments have far more cost-effective electricity-generation technologies at their disposal . 
Renewable energies like solar and wind are already competitive with fossil fuels in many parts of the world , and they can be scaled up rapidly . 
Moreover , most economic models do not account for the externalities related to coal and carbon pollution . 
For example , a recent report by Trucost estimates that coal-fired power generation worldwide may be responsible for around $ 1 trillion of damage due to climate change and air pollution . 
Many coal-fired power plants would be uncompetitive if they were required to internalize these costs . 
Of course , coal continues to offer millions of people a reliable source of electricity - and the transition to low-carbon technologies will not happen overnight . 
We need to expand access to these technologies rapidly , while helping people whose livelihoods depend on the coal industry . 
While we need to be passionate about climate change , we must also be pragmatic about how we address it . 
But so must the coal industry . 
Participants at the WCA meeting this week should commit to additional measures that will help ensure that emissions are kept within safe limits . 
A moratorium on conventional coal plants would be a smart place to start . 
That would help to show the world that the coal industry truly understands the scientific implications of current energy-use patterns , and that it is willing to assume more responsibility for combating climate change . 
We need people on both sides of the Vistula River to do their part to build a fair and ambitious universal climate agreement by 2015 . 
Let &apos;s roll up our sleeves together and plot a viable pathway to a safe and effective low-carbon economy .
