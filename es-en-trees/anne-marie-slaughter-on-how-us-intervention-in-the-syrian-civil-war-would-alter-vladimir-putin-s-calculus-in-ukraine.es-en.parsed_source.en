Stopping Russia Starts in Syria 
WASHINGTON , DC - The solution to the crisis in Ukraine lies in part in Syria . 
It is time for US President Barack Obama to demonstrate that he can order the offensive use of force in circumstances other than secret drone attacks or covert operations . 
The result will change the strategic calculus not only in Damascus , but also in Moscow , not to mention Beijing and Tokyo . 
Many argue that Obama &apos;s climb-down from his threatened missile strikes against Syria last August emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin to annex Crimea . 
Regardless of Putin &apos;s initial motivations , he is now operating in an environment in which he is quite certain of the parameters of play . 
He is weighing the value of further dismemberment of Ukraine , with some pieces either joining Russia or becoming Russian vassal states , against the pain of much stronger and more comprehensive economic sanctions . 
Western use of force , other than to send arms to a fairly hapless Ukrainian army , is not part of the equation . 
That is a problem . 
In the case of Syria , the US , the world &apos;s largest and most flexible military power , has chosen to negotiate with its hands tied behind its back for more than three years . 
This is no less of a mistake in the case of Russia , with a leader like Putin who measures himself and his fellow leaders in terms of crude machismo . 
It is time to change Putin &apos;s calculations , and Syria is the place to do it . 
Through a combination of mortars that shatter entire city quarters , starvation , hypothermia , and now barrel bombs that spray nails and shrapnel indiscriminately , President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s forces have seized the advantage . 
Slowly but surely , the government is reclaiming rebel-held territory . 
&quot; Realist &quot; foreign policy analysts openly describe Assad as the lesser evil compared to the Al Qaeda-affiliated members of the opposition ; others see an advantage in letting all sides fight it out , tying one another down for years . 
Moreover , the Syrian government does appear to be slowly giving up its chemical weapons , as it agreed last September to do . 
The problem is that if Assad continues to believe that he can do anything to his people except kill them with chemicals , he will exterminate his opponents , slaughtering everyone he captures and punishing entire communities , just as his father , Hafez al-Assad , massacred the residents of Hama in 1982 . 
He has demonstrated repeatedly that he is cut from the same ruthless cloth . 
Since the beginning of the Syrian conflict , Assad has fanned fears of what Sunni opposition forces might do to the Alawites , Druze , Christians and other minorities if they won . 
We have seen enough . 
A US strike against the Syrian government now would change the entire dynamic . 
It would either force the regime back to the negotiating table with a genuine intention of reaching a settlement , or at least make it clear that Assad will not have a free hand in re-establishing his rule . 
It is impossible to strike Syria legally so long as Russia sits on the United Nations Security Council , given its ability to veto any resolution authorizing the use of force . 
Among other things , Resolution 2139 requires that &quot; all parties immediately cease all attacks against civilians , as well as the indiscriminate employment of weapons in populated areas , including shelling and aerial bombardment , such as the use of barrel bombs .... &quot; 
The US , together with as many countries as will cooperate , could use force to eliminate Syria &apos;s fixed-wing aircraft as a first step toward enforcing Resolution 2139 . 
&quot; Aerial bombardment &quot; would still likely continue via helicopter , but such a strike would announce immediately that the game has changed . 
After the strike , the US , France , and Britain should ask for the Security Council &apos;s approval of the action taken , as they did after NATO &apos;s intervention in Kosovo in 1999 . 
Equally important , shots fired by the US in Syria will echo loudly in Russia . 
The great irony is that Putin is now seeking to do in Ukraine exactly what Assad has done so successfully : portray a legitimate political opposition as a gang of thugs and terrorists , while relying on provocations and lies to turn non-violent protest into violent attacks that then justify an armed response . 
Recall that the Syrian opposition marched peacefully under fire for six months before the first units of the Free Syrian Army tentatively began to form . 
In Ukraine , Putin would be happy to turn a peaceful opposition &apos;s ouster of a corrupt government into a civil war . 
Putin may believe , as Western powers have repeatedly told their own citizens , that NATO forces will never risk the possibility of nuclear war by deploying in Ukraine . 
Perhaps not . 
Mystery soldiers can fight on both sides . 
Putting force on the table in resolving the Ukraine crisis , even force used in Syria , is particularly important because economic pressure on Russia , as critical as it is in the Western portfolio of responses , can create a perverse incentive for Putin . 
As the Russian ruble falls and foreign investment dries up , the Russian population will become restive , giving him even more reason to distract them with patriotic spectacles welcoming still more &quot; Russians &quot; back to the motherland . 
Obama took office with the aim of ending wars , not starting them . 
So will allies ; 
To lead effectively , in both the national and the global interest , the US must demonstrate its readiness to shoulder the full responsibilities of power . 
Striking Syria might not end the civil war there , but it could prevent the eruption of a new one in Ukraine .
