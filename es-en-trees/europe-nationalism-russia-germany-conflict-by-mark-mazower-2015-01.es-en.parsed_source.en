New Europe &apos;s Old Ghosts 
NEW YORK - The past stalked Europe in 2014 . 
When the year started , the centennial of the Great War &apos;s outbreak attracted much commemorative energy . 
But , as it progressed , disturbing parallels appeared - not to 1914 , but to some of the nastier features of the interwar years . 
From Scotland and Catalonia to the borders of Ukraine , the politics of nationality flared , while Europe &apos;s economy stagnated - hostage to a German inflation phobia that dates back to 1923 . 
And , as the year unfolded , a new geopolitical tug of war between the continent &apos;s two early-twentieth-century giants , Germany and Russia , became apparent , while Europe &apos;s amnesiac political elite seemed to be fumbling on one front after another . 
To anyone who recalls Danzig and the Sudetenland - the endless nationality claims and counter-claims that triggered World War II in the borderlands of Eastern Europe - Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s revanchism in eastern Ukraine &apos;s Donbas region in 2014 has a disturbingly familiar ring to it . 
His rhetoric of humiliation and encirclement , the instrumental talk of minority rights , and the Kremlin &apos;s use of local proxies , with all of the uncertainties that accompany reliance on such actors - all of this was reminiscent of nothing so much as interwar Germany &apos;s own irredentist policies . 
The politics of nationality is not confined to Eastern Europe . 
Scotland &apos;s independence referendum in September threatened to split the United Kingdom . 
The same month , up to two million pro-independence Catalans marched through Barcelona , in what may have been the largest demonstration ever seen in Europe . 
Ask most Catalans what independence will bring , aside from freedom from Spain , and you won &apos;t get much of an answer : resentment at past wrongs overshadows any serious calculations about the future . 
But perhaps the purest reversion to interwar nationalist ideology is occurring just beyond Europe &apos;s borders - in Israel , of all places . 
There , Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s government has proposed a law enshrining the collective primacy of the country &apos;s Jews - legislation that destroys in spirit and form what little is left of Israel &apos;s founding commitment to equality under the law . 
Could there be any sadder demonstration of the cunning of history ? 
Europe &apos;s past was equally present in the realm of economics in 2014 . 
Thanks to the European Union &apos;s austerity policies , the eurozone faces the prospect of a Japan-style era of stagnation , and chronic high unemployment on its southern fringe . 
The irony is that Germany &apos;s anxieties about price stability , which underlie the EU &apos;s embrace of austerity , are entirely misplaced : German inflation could scarcely be lower . 
With German unemployment , too , hitting record lows , while joblessness hits record highs in Italy and remains at obscene levels in Greece and Spain , what has emerged is a two-tier Europe , with German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government calling the shots . 
For now , the periphery countries calculate that the eventual benefits to be gained from remaining within the eurozone will outweigh the current pain of austerity . 
For its part , Germany exacts austerity as the price of its participation in the single currency . 
It is on this uneasy basis that its hegemony in Europe rests . 
Though depoliticization and apathy have held back serious challenges to German dominance , such challenges are emerging . 
German policymakers have discounted the rise of extremism in relatively small countries such as Hungary and Greece . 
But one wonders how they might respond to spectacular results for Marine Le Pen &apos;s National Front in next year &apos;s French regional elections or in the presidential election in 2017 . 
And of course the big mystery is Germany itself , seemingly lifted from history by its own economic buoyancy . 
Can German politicians abandon Weimar-style economics before they are hit by Weimar-style political disintegration ? 
And even if they manage this eventually , will Germany have lost much of Europe in the meantime ? 
This brings us to the nascent but unmistakable signs of a Russo-German rift . 
If Franco-German rivalry shaped the era between 1870 and 1920 , it was the conflict with Russia that defined the next 70 years . 
That conflict was forgotten for two decades after the end of the Cold War , because Russia &apos;s internal travails and Germany &apos;s desire to demonstrate its post-unification harmlessness kept both powers from flexing their muscles . 
Now that Putin has made muscle-flexing his main form of diplomacy - not merely in Ukraine and the Baltic states , but also in the Balkans and the North Sea - it has fallen to Germany to shape Europe &apos;s response . 
The motive today is not to defend ethnic Germans abroad - their expulsion in the millions in the 1940s ended that particular concern - so much as the more laudable desire to preserve the values of a democratic EU against the new authoritarianism from the East . 
Whether Germany can continue to perform this role , however , will depend on what kind of EU emerges over the next few years . 
In particular , if Europe is to succeed with Germany at the helm , Germans and everyone else will have to break more decisively with the past than they have managed to do so far .
