Remembering and Forgetting Zhao Ziyang 
So , at last former Chinese Premier and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang has died . 
But the political agenda that he espoused while in office passed away long ago , on May 19 , 1989 , when he appeared in Tiananmen Square just before dawn to beg tearfully for the forgiveness of protesters . 
&quot; I am very sorry , &quot; he said to startled onlookers . 
&quot; I have come too late . &quot; 
After that , he existed more as an historical chimera than as a real person . 
When his bizarre and unscheduled appearance in the square was broadcast on Central Chinese Television the next morning - during one of the last days of uncensored media coverage - people across China were stunned by this fleeting moment of all-too-human , official anguish . 
After all , Party leaders rarely evince their personal feelings in public , much less transgress the Party line as brazenly as Zhao did . 
Such individualism fit neither Leninist nor traditional Chinese proscriptions for behavior by a high official . 
As the crackdown following those heady weeks of free expression and assembly came to its apocalyptic end on the night of June 3-4 , Zhao vanished , sucked down the Party &apos;s memory hole into which so many other leaders have vanished since China &apos;s &quot; socialist liberation . &quot; 
To the discredit of the democratic world , hardly any head of state remonstrated on Zhao &apos;s behalf , minimally demanding that some accounting be made for his illegal and immoral incarceration . 
Instead , Zhao was allowed to remain in suspended animation , under house arrest , conveniently forgotten like some cryogenically frozen celebrity with no hope of resurrection . 
Zhao was not killed , but allowed to live in an old Beijing courtyard house with his family . 
He was let out from time to time , but under guard like a zoo animal , to go to some spa or to play solitary holes of golf , one of the many manifestations of &quot; bourgeois liberalization &quot; that his reform efforts allowed to leak through China &apos;s once hermetic seal . 
Chinese have long since used the deaths of defrocked leaders as occasions to let out sentiments that can find no expression through the normal political process . 
During the winter of 1976 , when Premier Zhou Enlai ( viewed as a relative liberal in the Maoist hierarchy ) died , tens of thousands of people spontaneously flooded Tiananmen Square , giving the Party a tremendous fright . 
It was , of course , the death of former Party chief Hu Yaobang , a liberal like Zhao , which set off the protests in 1989 . 
Whether Zhao &apos;s supporters will express themselves in a similar fashion is uncertain . 
The events of 1989 remain so sensitive , and Tiananmen Square so securely guarded , that it is hard to imagine a protest happening there soon . 
At the same time , China seems so drugged on business nowadays that it is hard to imagine many people marching for a cause that would do nothing for their bottom line . 
It &apos;s almost as if the Communist Party had turned Marx on his head , replacing religion with profit as the new &quot; opium of the masses . &quot; 
Few outside of the lumpen classes of unemployed workers and dispossessed peasants seem to have any gusto for political protest . 
By contrast , Zhao embodied a chapter in Chinese history when to be a reformer meant to take on not only the economy , but every aspect of life . 
Before becoming Premier and Party chief , he experimented with everything from the de-collectivization of agriculture and separation of the Party from business to laws guaranteeing the rights of journalists and greater openness toward the outside world for ordinary people . 
He was even the first Chinese leader to wear a suit and tie rather than a Mao habit when traveling abroad , as well as the first to hold an open press conference . 
Although Zhao was no visionary , no Vaclav Havel or Lech Walesa , and not even anti-communist , his agenda in the mid-1980 &quot; s embraced the economy , politics , culture , media , and society , and it led to one of the most open and intellectually rich periods of Chinese history . 
It was a tragic paradox that the political movement that so peacefully swept China in 1989 ended up arresting the process of broad-based , evolutionary reform to which Zhao consecrated his life . 
So chastened by the trauma of June 4 was the Party leadership that , for several years afterwards , it was unclear if any reform would survive . 
Then , in 1992 , Deng Xiaoping set in motion one of the most rapid and total marketizations of a society in history , catalyzing China &apos;s spectacular rise as an economic superpower . 
Zhao Ziyang &apos;s death reminds us not only of how unjustly he was treated , but of how lopsided China &apos;s reforms have been . 
For China &apos;s &quot; miracle &quot; to truly become miraculous , Party leaders could do worse than study the record of a man whose legacy they now seem eager to push into oblivion .
