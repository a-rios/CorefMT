Will Cancun Promote or Undermine Development ? 
From September 10-14 , trade ministers from around the world will meet for the next stage of what is supposed to be the Development Round of trade talks . 
At their last meeting in Doha in November 2001 , ministers recognized the inequities of the previous round of trade negotiations , the Uruguay round . 
This round was supposed to redress those imbalances . 
One would have thought that the developing countries would look forward to the meeting as a chance to achieve a fairer global trading system . 
Instead , many fear that what has happened in the past will happen again : secret negotiations , arm twisting , and the display of brute economic power by the US and Europe - and by special interests in the advanced countries - aimed at ensuring that the interests of the rich are protected . 
While some progress has been made in making the negotiations more open and transparent , efforts to go further have met with resistance , and for good reason : unbalanced processes help ensure unbalanced outcomes . 
Ironically , the World Trade Organization , where each country has one vote , might seem far more &quot; democratic &quot; than , say , the IMF , where a single country , the US , has a veto . 
Yet the realpolitik of economic power has ensured that the interests of the developed countries predominate . 
Here is a short checklist against which to assess whether the outcomes of Cancun represent a move towards a true development round . 
· Agriculture . 
Most people in the developing world live in the rural sector , which is why free and fair trade in agriculture matters . 
It &apos;s not just a question of providing access , but of eliminating the subsidies that encourage production in rich countries and harm farmers in poor countries . 
The numbers are truly alarming : subsidies in advanced countries exceed the total income of sub-Saharan Africa ; the average European subsidy per cow matches the $ 2 per day poverty level on which billions of people barely subsist ; 
America &apos;s $ 4 billion cotton subsidies to 25,000 well-off farmers bring misery to 10 million African farmers and more than offset America &apos;s miserly foreign aid to some of the affected countries . 
Although both Europe and America accuse each other of unfair agricultural policies , neither side seems willing to make major concessions . · Drugs and intellectual property . 
TRIPS , the intellectual property regime adopted in the last round of trade negotiations , deprived millions in the developing world of access to life-saving drugs . 
As a chorus of researchers has pointed out , the provisions , pushed by the pharmaceutical companies , were so unbalanced that they were bad for scientific progress . 
Here , there has been some progress - but not enough . 
Provisions demanded by the US would have made it difficult for small countries , like Botswana , to gain affordable access . 
Developing countries also continue to worry about bio-piracy - the patenting by Western firms of traditional foods and drugs . 
· Textiles . 
The Uruguay round promised the elimination of quotas in 2004 , enabling many developing countries to exploit another area of comparative advantage . 
But many developing countries worry that trade restrictions will remain , whether through &quot; safeguards &quot; to protect jobs or through high tariffs . 
Many also fear that the West will find some way to wiggle out of its commitments . 
· A more balanced liberalization agenda . 
With services comprising an increasing share of production in developed countries , attention has shifted to liberalization of trade in services . 
A more balanced agenda would balance attempts to ease capital flows with efforts to facilitate the flow of labor , including unskilled labor . 
· Competition . 
Everyone advocates &quot; fair competition . &quot; 
But discussions about competition and fair trade again demonstrate the intellectual poverty and inequity of trade negotiations . 
Anti-dumping laws are intended to ensure fair trade by preventing the sale of goods below cost . 
Within the developed countries , there has long been concern about such behavior - so-called &quot; predation &quot;  - and well-defined standards have been developed . 
With globalization , it would be natural to extend such principles to the international arena , making it irrelevant whether a producer is domestic or foreign when judging whether he is engaged in an unfair trade practice . 
But it does make a difference whether a good is produced at home or abroad . 
Foreign producers are accused of &quot; unfair &quot; competition far more easily than domestic producers . 
Indeed , if the standards of domestic trade laws were applied internationally , perhaps a majority of firms within the US would be guilty of dumping . 
Yet America &apos;s Supreme Court has set standards so high for American firms to be found guilty of predation that few cases are successfully prosecuted domestically . 
The trade negotiators are not even discussing eliminating this double standard . 
So developing countries worry that efforts to introduce &quot; competition &quot; within trade negotiations will only make life even more difficult . 
They worry that efforts to promote domestic industries or provide preferential treatment to disadvantaged groups ( the kind of affirmative action programs that have been so important , both in developed and less developed countries ) will be labeled &quot; unfair &quot; to foreign firms , and thus be prohibited . 
There is a real danger that what was intended to remedy the imbalances of previous trade rounds will not only fail to do so , but may introduce new imbalances . 
Pushing countries to liberalize their capital markets and open them up to speculative capital flows is one example . 
At the very moment when the IMF has finally recognized that such liberalization may produce instability but not growth , the WTO is now pursuing it . 
Failure at Cancun would confirm the fears of those who resisted a new round of trade negotiations . 
Needless to say , it would also provide support for the anti-globalization protestors everywhere .
