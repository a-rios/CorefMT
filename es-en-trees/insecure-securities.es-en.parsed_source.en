Insecure Securities 
MUNICH - Once upon a time , stocks were risky and collateralized securities were safe . 
That time is over , as the breakdown of the American mortgage securitization market has shown . 
For years , hundreds of billions of new mortgage-backed securities ( MBSs ) and collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) generated from them were sold to the world to compensate for the lack of savings in the United States and to finance American housing investment . 
Now virtually the entire market for new issues of such securities - all but 3 % of the original market volume - has vanished . 
To compensate for the disappearance of that market , and for the simultaneous disappearance of non-securitized bank lending to American homeowners , 95 % of US mortgages today are channeled through the state institutions Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and Ginnie Mae . 
Just as there was a time when collateralized securities were safe , there was also a time when economies with so much state intervention were called socialist . 
Most of these private securities were sold to oil-exporting countries and Europe , in particular Germany , Britain , the Benelux countries , Switzerland , and Ireland . 
China and Japan shied away from buying such paper . 
As a result , European banks have suffered from massive write-offs on toxic American securities . 
According to the International Monetary Fund , more than 50 % of the pre-crisis equity capital of Western Europe &apos;s national banking systems , or $ 1.6 trillion , will have been destroyed by the end of 2010 , with the lion &apos;s share of losses being of US origin . 
Thus , the resource transfer from Europe to the US is similar in size to what the US has spent on the Iraq war ( $ 750 billion ) and the Afghanistan war ( $ 300 billion ) together . 
Americans now claim caveat emptor : Europeans should have known how risky these securities were when they bought them . 
Europeans trusted a system that was untrustworthy . 
Two years ago , Ben Bernanke , chairman of the US Federal Reserve , argued that foreigners were buying US securities because they trusted America &apos;s financial supervisory system and wanted to participate in the dynamism of its economy . 
Now we know that this was propaganda intended to keep the foreign money flowing , so that US households could continue to finance their lifestyles . 
The propaganda was successful . 
Even in 2008 , the US was able to attract net capital inflows of $ 808 billion . 
For years , the US had a so-called &quot; return privilege . &quot; 
It earned a rate of return on its foreign assets that was nearly twice as high as the rate it paid foreigners on US assets . One hypothesis is that this reflected better choices by US investment bankers . 
Another is that US ratings agencies helped fool the world by giving triple-A ratings to their American clients , while aggressively downgrading foreign borrowers . 
Indeed , it is clear that ratings were ridiculously distorted . 
According to the IMF , 80 % of CDOs were in this category . 
And according to an NBER working paper by Efraim Benmelech and Jennifer Dlugosz , 70 % of the CDOs received a triple-A rating even though the MBSs from which they were constructed had just a B + rating , on average , which would have made them unmarketable . 
The authors therefore called the process of constructing CDOs &quot; alchemy , &quot; the art of turning lead into gold . 
The main problem with US mortgage-based securities is that they are non-recourse . 
A CDO is a claim against a chain of claims that ends at US homeowners . 
Only the homeowners are liable . 
However , the holder of a CDO or MBS would be unable to take these homeowners to court . And even if he succeeded , homeowners could simply return their house keys , as they , too , enjoy the protection of non-recourse . 
As home prices declined and one-third of US mortgage loans went under water - that is , the property &apos;s market value sank below the amount of the loan - three million US homeowners lost their homes , unable to meet their payment obligations , making the CDOs and MBSs empty shells . 
The problem was exacerbated by fraudulent , or at least dubious , evaluation practices . 
For example , homeowners signed cash-back contracts with builders to feign a higher home value and receive bigger loans , and brokers &quot; fees were added to mortgages and the reported values of homes . 
Low-income people who could not be expected ever to repay their loans were given so-called NINJA credits : &quot; No income , no job , no assets . &quot; 
Such reckless and irresponsible behavior abounded . 
The US will have to reinvent its system of mortgage finance in order to escape the socialist trap into which it has fallen . 
A minimal reform would be to force banks to retain on their balance sheets a certain proportion of the securities that they issue . 
That way , they would share the pain if the securities are not serviced - and thus gain a powerful incentive to maintain tight mortgage-lending standards . 
An even better solution would be to go the European way : get rid of non-recourse loans and develop a system of finance based on covered bonds , such as the German Pfandbriefe . 
If a Pfandbrief is not serviced , one can take the issuing bank to court . 
If the bank goes bankrupt , the holder of the covered bond has a direct claim against the homeowner , who cannot escape payment by simply returning his house key . 
Since their creation in Prussia in 1769 under Frederick the Great , not a single Pfandbrief has defaulted . 
Unlike the financial junk pouring out of the US in recent years , covered bonds are a security that is worthy of the name .
