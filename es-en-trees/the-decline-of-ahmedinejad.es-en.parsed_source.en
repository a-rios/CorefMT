The Decline of Ahmedinejad 
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad may be gaining support across the Muslim world for his fervent criticism of the United States , but inside Iran , he is losing strength . 
His political rivals are gaining new positions of power , and the population is increasingly unhappy with the economy &apos;s continuing decline . 
Since its inception , the Islamic Republic has had a weak presidency ; ultimate authority rests with the Supreme Leader , first Ayatollah Khomeini and now Ayatollah Khamenei . 
The Islamic Republic &apos;s first president , Abolhassan Bani Sadr , was dismissed from office a year after his election . 
Ever since , the regime has been intolerant of a strong president , and has repeatedly demonstrated that the office is subservient to the Supreme Leader . 
Ahmedinejad &apos;s election two years ago came with great expectations , with the new president pledging to &quot; bring oil prices to the dining table of all households in Iran , &quot; and to crack down on corruption . 
Yet many of his first appointments were rewards to his supporters and cronies in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Basij militia , armed groups that mobilized voters on his behalf during the campaign . 
For example , an the Oil Ministry gave a $ 1.3 billion no-bid contract to an oil company associated with the Revolutionary Guard , and Ahmedinejad appointed his brother-in-law as cabinet secretary . 
Steps like these may have been overlooked in better economic times . 
But the Iranian budget is now running a 15 % -of-GDP deficit , and foreign reserves are shrinking , despite the oil boom . 
Instead of distributing oil revenues through a program of low-cost loans , as promised , the government has been forced to ration gasoline , as economic promise has given way to crisis . 
Tensions have also been on the rise since Ahmedinejad fulfilled his campaign promise to enforce Islamic strictures on social life . 
For two years , police have waged an intense campaign against women and young people . 
Last summer , more than 150,000 women were arrested in Tehran for wearing &quot; bad veils , &quot; and barber shops have been given specific instructions on acceptable hairstyles for young men . 
Demonstrations by bus drivers , school teachers , women &apos;s rights activists , and students have been brutally suppressed , with dozens of arrests . 
Photos and video clips of police beating civilians in Tehran and other cities have been disseminated on the Internet . 
But now Ahmedinejad &apos;s opponents are moving to reassert longstanding constraints on the presidency . 
His foremost rival , Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , a former president who Ahmedinejad defeated to win the post , has had a remarkable reversal of fortune , reemerging as leader of the Assembly of Experts , the powerful body that elects Iran &apos;s Supreme Leader and that can even remove a Supreme Leader from office . 
Moreover , conservatives who had aligned themselves with Ahmedinejad are now criticizing him openly . 
Even Ayatollah Khamenei , who as Supreme Leader is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces , has taken steps to demonstrate his authority , recently firing the leaders of the Revolutionary Guard and the Basij militia . 
Among Iran analysts , it is thought that these moves were intended to revitalize the military , particularly given the possibility of conflict with the US . 
But experts also note that the former commanders were close to Ahmedinejad and had made a great effort over the last two years to help him implement his agenda . 
While Ahmedinejad continues his verbal attacks on the US , he does not control the policy-making apparatus that will decide about Iran &apos;s nuclear program and its relations with the international community . 
The threat of sanctions remains potent , and the Iranian business community - not to mention the public - has felt the sting of isolation . 
Considering the tangled involvement of Iran &apos;s leaders in the economy , the effect of sanctions should not be underestimated . 
The economy remains the one area of Iranian life where Ahmedinejad retains considerable power . 
But here , his record is weak , and his pronouncements only exacerbate the problem by increasing Iran &apos;s isolation from the global economy . 
So , as disputes with the West come to a head , it is important to recognize the power shifts underway inside Iran &apos;s opaque political system . 
Ahmedinejad may be making increasingly challenging statements , but he does not have the authority to act on them . 
Indeed , only a military confrontation with the US can bring him back to the center of decision-making . 
American policymakers should bear that in mind .
