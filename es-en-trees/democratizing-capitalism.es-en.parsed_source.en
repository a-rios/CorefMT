Democratizing Capitalism 
Capitalism is the world &apos;s engine of growth . 
But its very dynamism - its &quot; creative destruction &quot;  - tends to produce great uncertainties . 
Unsuccessful firms are tossed aside to make way for new and better firms , and individuals who become economically less productive ( often through no fault of their own ) can also be &quot; discarded &quot; by the market , their careers interrupted and their investments cut to a fraction of their previous value . 
This uncertainty has been at the root of demands for the state to intervene and protect the individual against the market &apos;s mercilessness . 
Beginning with Bismarck &apos;s social security system in 19 th century Germany , through the American New Deal of the 1930 &apos;s , to the social-democratic policies of postwar Europe , many countries created a &quot; mixed &quot; welfare state in which governments control and temper market forces , providing an extensive &quot; safety net &quot; for individuals . 
But despite its achievements , many people believe that the welfare state comes at too high a price in terms of dampening economic dynamism . 
The prospect raised by today &apos;s new technologies in finance and information is that some of the &quot; market failures &quot; at the root of state involvement in the economy may cease to exist . 
Indeed , the &quot; creative destruction &quot; that generates unacceptable risk to individuals is poised to deliver the means for tempering these same risks . 
In fact , the most important capitalist mechanisms for blunting the impact of risk on individuals - insurance , diversification , and hedging - have been around for centuries . 
But broader application of these tools has accelerated with the advent of new information technology , which also allows us to apply these tools without undermining people &apos;s incentive to work . 
Indeed , the world seems to be entering an age in which the basic principles of finance will be integrated into the world capitalist economy , and our lives , in a more thoroughgoing way than ever before . 
Aided by advanced information technology , financial institutions will be democratized and made available to everyone , which will go a long way toward solving today &apos;s problems of increasing inequality and declining economic vitality . 
An example of recent progress illustrates what I mean . 
For most middle-class people in developed countries , the home they own is their most valuable asset . 
Although the postwar population boom and heavy regulation meant that real estate prices in many countries went up more often than down , a sudden collapse of the property market - such as happened in Japan a decade ago - may dramatically reduce the value of most people &apos;s savings . 
Such a financial &quot; hit &quot; may affect their consumption patterns , complicate their retirement plans , and even bring them to the brink of indigence . 
Yet , until recently , one could insure one &apos;s home against fire or other damage , but not against a loss in market value . 
That is changing . 
Two recent developments indicate the shape of things to come , although neither has attracted much notice . 
First , in October 2001 , the spread-betting firm City Index created futures markets on home prices in the United Kingdom . 
In May 2003 , the investment bank Goldman Sachs created options markets for home prices , for the UK as a whole and for Greater London , with both to be traded on the London Stock Exchange . 
Theoretically , homeowners can use these new instruments to protect themselves against their home losing value . 
But these instruments are rather sophisticated - too sophisticated , in fact , for most homeowners to embrace . 
Second , in July 2002 , the city of Syracuse , New York , in conjunction with the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation , the Yale School of Management , and Realliquidity , LLC , created home equity insurance that pays out if an index of city home prices declines . 
Like the British options and futures market for home prices , this novel insurance policy is also , for the time being , a limited development , made possible by new information technology in the form of electronic databases of home prices and characteristics . 
Someday , these two institutions will be brought together in one country . 
Regulators permitting , insurance companies will then be able to write policies against loss of home value for individuals , and then will be able protect themselves against the risk to which these policies expose them by taking offsetting positions in the futures or options markets . 
This should make them willing to offer such policies to millions of people in different localities . 
Home equity insurance will clearly not solve all the problems of individual risk , but it will solve a very big one . 
Moreover , it is only one example of the democratization of finance now underway . 
Further advances along these lines will follow . 
Many risks are gradually being added to the list of those that can be insured against . 
The types of risks traded on electronic marketplaces are steadily expanding . 
Trading platforms are being improved to allow more complex trading . 
Databases are rapidly improving in depth , and are becoming more deeply integrated with personal financial-planning Web sites . 
Even systems of taxation and social welfare are more sophisticated in using new tools of insurance , finance , and information technology . 
As a result , our mechanisms for dealing with risk can become increasingly differentiated and complex . 
With modern computers and information technology , it will be possible to deal individually with a million different risks . 
The combined effect of many different financial innovations will be to blunt the impact of capitalist risk on our individual lives , helping to reduce economic uncertainty and inequality .
