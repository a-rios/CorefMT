The Scientific Men \ u0027s Club 
I serve on the senior appointments and promotions committee of a medical school . 
Over the years , I &apos;ve come to recognize something that is as disturbing as it is undeniable : as a group , male basic scientists sail through the committee effortlessly . 
Many work in fields so specialized that they have only ten colleagues in the entire world , half of whom are their mentors or one-time fellow graduate students . 
These are their &quot; peers , &quot; and they readily provide laudatory letters of recommendation establishing that the applicant has attained &quot; national and international recognition . &quot; 
In contrast , applications by clinical faculty and women provoke far more discussion . 
I don &apos;t resent the ease with which basic science faculty are promoted ; after all , I am sure that I also enjoyed the perks that come with this designation . 
Nonetheless , the system seems blatantly unfair . 
We rely on external referees for promoting basic scientists , who publish their work in national or international journals . 
By contrast , it is difficult to quantify how good clinical scientists are . 
Indeed , we struggle - more or less successfully , I think - even to define what a &quot; scholarly &quot; practicing physician is , because a clinician &apos;s reputation rests on local interactions that are often difficult to document . 
The issue of women faculty members , especially in basic sciences , is far more complex . 
I suspect that here the problem reflects fundamental differences between the way women and men approach science as a microcosm of life . 
Most of my fellow male faculty members are not muscle-bound , testosterone-driven types , but in their scientific careers , they display two types of typically male behavior . 
The first is a compulsion to be the first to establish completely trivial facts about science . 
As I grow older , I &apos;m no longer sure why this is so important , but the male members of our species seem to think that it is . 
Most young male faculty members have an obsessive need to work 20 hours a day , seven days a week to make sure that a ( sometimes-illusory ) competitor is beaten to the punch . 
Ten or 15 years from now , will anybody care ? 
Most women in basic sciences seem to be uninterested from the outset in playing such games . 
The second male behavior is a patricidal imperative that is perhaps the most shameful and atavistic of the primal impulses that still lurk in some archaic part of our brains . 
The idea that one must somehow supplant one &apos;s mentor , cast the previous generation out into the wilderness , and make oneself the leader of the pack seems to obsess men . 
Women scientists seem to behave far more collegially . 
There is a certain senior ( male ) faculty member who is one of the kindest and most accomplished investigators at my institution . 
He is surrounded by and works with a group of young women he has mentored . 
Most are bright , creative , and productive in their own right , but they do not seek desperately to dissociate themselves from him , establish their own little fiefdoms elsewhere , and beat him at his own game . 
At the risk of sounding simplistic , I can &apos;t help feeling that working together as a group is an innately feminine tendency . 
More importantly , I can &apos;t help believing that this way of operating is ultimately far more scientifically productive than the traditional male drive to establish one &apos;s own &quot; identity &quot; and &quot; independence . &quot; 
Unfortunately , one of the unwritten laws of academia - unquestioned by the committee on which I serve - is that a candidate who does not seek and grasp the holy grail of &quot; independence &quot; is not qualified to be promoted . 
Almost every time a woman candidate comes up before the committee , her &quot; independence &quot; is questioned in a way that is irrelevant , if not insulting . 
Sadder still , the most stringent adherents to and enforcers of this male paradigm are the rare women that have &quot; made it &quot; in the male world to serve on the committee . 
&quot; I made it , &quot; they seem to say , &quot; so why can &apos;t she ? &quot; 
In most cases , the women are as smart as the men , if not smarter . 
But most have chosen to work either in a group with their mentors or with their husbands , who often work in the same fields . 
Although they generate as many of the ideas as their male colleagues do , it is the latter who go to meetings and present the group &apos;s research results . 
This seems to me to reflect women &apos;s all-too-common impulse to accommodate the unbridled male ego rather than any deficiency in their creativity or &quot; independence . &quot; 
There was surely a time when eschewing children and family was the only way that a woman could prove her commitment to science . 
In many places , that has begun to change . 
I hope that the time will come when there are enough women in science that a greater diversity of female role models is represented in bodies that decide about careers . 
This would encourage greater sympathy for and empathy with the different needs and impulses of women and men - and a deeper appreciation that the male paradigm is not the only valid one within which to live life and excel in science .
