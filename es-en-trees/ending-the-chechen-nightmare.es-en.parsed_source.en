Ending the Chechen Nightmare 
Once again , Russia &apos;s war in Chechnya - which has rumbled murderously on for a decade - has blasted its way onto Moscow &apos;s streets . 
The horrific death toll among innocent theater-going Muscovites confirms Russia &apos;s struggle against Chechen rebels as a distinct and bloody front in the global war on terrorism . 
That war must be won . 
But the time has also come for Russia to change its policy . Chechnya should remain part of the Russian Federation . 
But , clearly , that strategic goal cannot be achieved by military means alone . 
But the Chechen resistance is never crushed as was proved , not only by the taking hostage of over 800 Muscovites last week , but by the numerous successful Chechen raids on Russian troops in and around Chechnya . 
It would be wrong to put the entire blame for Russia &apos;s inability to crush the rebellion on our military commanders , although their planning could be better . 
Why not ? 
Because the Chechen rebellion began in politics and it can only end through a political understanding . 
What should be done ? 
The first step must be to separate peaceful Chechens from the rebels . 
Regrettably , Russia failed to do this at the insurrection &apos;s onset , primarily because the bandits resided in villages and towns , which meant that many civilian deaths ensued when Russian forces attacked the rebels head-on . 
Today , Russian federal forces are trying to separate common people from the bandits by entrusting the powers of self-government and security in Chechen settlements to indigenous Chechens . 
But this method is not working and won &apos;t work if pursued along the current lines . 
Most peaceful Chechens have not fully turned their backs on the bandits , perhaps because the bandits hunt down those who collaborate with Russian authorities . 
Moreover , many Chechens fear Russian officials more than the bandits . 
This transfer of executive authority to local Chechen self-governments will continue to fail unless local Chechen rebel commanders are induced to join the talks . 
These commanders are often clan leaders who have never stood for election , and won &apos;t ever consider putting their authority up for a vote . 
These men alone have the ability to deliver peace , if not democracy . 
If maintaining their authority and local autonomy is the price that must be paid to end , or at least limit the slaughter , Russia should agree . 
A big worry here , however , is that some Chechen rebels want to negotiate so as to play for time to regroup and resupply themselves . 
The global war on terrorism has made it more difficult for them to secure financial and material support . 
Afghanistan is no longer a training and supply base ; 
Saudi Arabia and Turkey now strictly control citizens who once helped Chechen separatists . 
Even Georgia now closely - although not as closely as Russia would like - restricts Chechen activity . 
The world must assist Russia in seeing to it that alternative supply routes for the rebels do not materialize . 
A year ago , President Putin offered negotiations between his representative and an envoy of Aslan Maskhadov , the Chechen rebel warlord who won internationally supervised elections as Chechen president in 1997 . 
That initiative collapsed because the Chechens were ordered to surrender their weapons within 72 hours . 
But President Putin intended them to have 72 hours to ponder the good that might come from negotiations 
That clumsy diplomacy should not stop talks from getting underway . 
Anything less would be utterly unacceptable to ordinary Russians traumatized by the body count of dead hostages in Moscow . 
It must also be understood that negotiations cannot rule out Russian military operations against bandits who continue their attacks as the negotiations ensue . 
Thus part of the federal forces must remain in Chechnya during any peace talks , which will also serve to strengthen the hand of those Chechens who choose to negotiate and are prepared to ensure the security of their settlements . 
But just because Russia &apos;s troops will remain in Chechnya during any peace talks does not mean that they should conduct the talks . 
This happened after the first Chechen campaign ( 1994-1996 ) , but the peace that ensued was merely an armed truce . 
Instead , a representative of President Putin must oversee everything in Chechnya : economic development , military action , and efforts to alleviate the suffering of the Chechen population . 
This person should assume control of Defense Ministry units , Interior Ministry troops , FSB agencies and local administrations . 
Chechnya could be granted the status of a special presidential area throughout any negotiations - indeed , until local Chechen authorities establish their ability to enforce the rule of law . 
A single command accountable directly to President Putin would rule out uncoordinated actions , improve discipline , strengthen the responsibility of those who are dealing with Chechnya , and diminish the carelessness with Chechen civilian lives of some Russian commanders . 
The world now sees and understands the mighty burden Russia has borne , and is bearing , in Chechnya . 
It must also know that international solidarity in the war on terror must mean not only Russia supporting America in Afghanistan , but America and the West backing Russia in its counter-terrorist struggle . 
The terrible death count in Moscow , much as Russians may want to seek revenge , must also help all Russians see that Chechnya is a political problem demanding a political , not a military , solution .
