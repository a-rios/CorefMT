The Richest Get Richer 
Card-carrying neo-liberals like me , who pushed for opening capital flows wide in the early 1990 &apos;s , had a particular vision in mind . 
But the future that we hoped for did not come to pass . 
We looked at how extraordinarily strongly the world &apos;s system of relative prices was tilted against the poor : how cheap were the products they exported , and how expensive were the capital goods that they needed to import in order to industrialize and develop . 
&quot; Why not free up capital flows and so encourage large-scale lending from the rich to the poor ? &quot; we asked . 
Such large-scale lending might cut a generation off the time it would take economies where people were poor to converge with the industrial structures and living standards of rich countries . 
Certainly such large-scale borrowing and lending had played a key role in the late-19th century . 
Canada , the western United States , Australia , New Zealand , Chile , Argentina , Uruguay , and South Africa : all were developed due to imported capital a century ago . 
But things didn &apos;t turn out that way this time around . 
Instead of capital flowing from rich to poor , just the opposite happened : it flowed from poor to rich , the overwhelmingly largest stream going to the US , whose rate of capital inflow is now the largest of any country , anywhere , anytime . 
What has fed these inflows ? 
One source is central banks seeking to keep the value of their home currencies down so that their workers can gain valuable experience from exporting to the rich world . 
Another source is investors who feared losing their money after the various emerging market meltdowns of the 1990 &apos;s , techno-enthusiasts chasing the pot of gold that the American technology boom seemed to offer , and the third-world rich , who think a Deutsche Bank account is good to have in case they need to flee their countries in a Lear jet or a rubber boat . 
All of these sources contributed to the flow of money into the US , which was thus enabled to invest much more than it had managed to save . 
America &apos;s economy became - and remains - a giant vacuum cleaner , soaking up the world &apos;s spare investment cash . 
So those of us who still wish to be flag-waving advocates for international capital mobility are reduced to two arguments . 
First , and most important , capital controls create ideal conditions for large-scale corruption . 
With capital controls , people who badly want to move their capital across borders can &apos;t - unless they find some complaisant bureaucrat . 
But an effective market economy needs to minimize the incentives and opportunities for corruption , or it will turn into something worse . 
Second , perhaps the inflow of capital into America was and remains justified : perhaps there is something uniquely valuable about investments in America today . 
( But in that case , if these investment opportunities are so great , why aren &apos;t Americans themselves saving more - both privately and publicly - to take advantage of them ? ) 
The years 1960 to 1985 formed the era in which development was to be financed by public institutions like the World Bank , because market failures and distrust of governments made it hard for poor countries to borrow privately . 
The years 1985 to 2000 were the era in which development was to be financed by private lending to countries that adopted the market-friendly and market-conforming policies that were supposed to lead to high returns and rapid growth . 
The first era was not an unqualified success . 
Looking at the capital flow reversal into the US , I cannot argue that the second era has been an unqualified success either . 
It is nice that Mexican workers and entrepreneurs are gaining experience in export manufactures , and successful enough to run a trade surplus vis-Ã -vis the US . 
But the flip side of the trade surplus is the capital outflow . 
Should capital-poor Mexico really be financing a further jump in the capital intensity of the US economy ? 
It is not possible for a card-carrying neo-liberal like me to wish for anything but the most minor of controls to curb speculative of capital flows . 
Capital markets can get the allocation of investment badly wrong , but governments are likely to get it wrong even worse , and the incentives to corrupt bureaucrats do need to be kept as low as possible . 
But the hope for a repetition of the late 19th-century experience has - so far - proved vain . 
Unlike in the heyday of liberalism , money from the world &apos;s rich countries simply is not going to give peripheral economies the priceless gift of rapid , successful development .
