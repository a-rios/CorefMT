Warning : Hospitals May be Unsafe for the Poor 
Most public health initiatives in developing countries focus on controlling infectious diseases in the community . 
The morbidity and mortality caused by diseases such as malaria , tuberculosis , schistosomiasis , and pediatric pneumonia and diarrhea certainly justify such priorities . 
But another aspect of the public health system in nations with limited healthcare resources - hospital � acquired infection - has been largely ignored by the public , press , and funding agencies . 
Developing nations lavish their limited resources on hospitals , which consume more than 50 % of healthcare budgets in many poor countries . 
Officials in these countries are striving to identify sick patients in the community and to triage them to regional facilities that have the expertise to provide appropriate diagnosis and treatment . 
Some of these facilities may be modest local clinics with a few beds . 
The craving for expensive , technologically sophisticated care is noteworthy . 
In part , poor countries make these large investments because they are devoted to improving the quality of diagnosis and treatment . 
In part , they make them to keep their best physicians . 
These doctors , trained in advanced countries , return home with a keen desire to use their newly honed skills , only to find themselves hamstrung by outdated radiology equipment , a limited range and unreliable supply of drugs , and primitive life � support technology . 
High � tech hospitals are also status symbols , and some countries seek prestige by building the most modern facilities . 
The industrialized countries that build and help fund these projects may be motivated , at least in part , by pressure from the companies that make high � tech equipment and supplies . 
Nations that make large investments in hospitals and physicians who are devoted to improving quality of care clearly expect to see improved patient outcomes . 
But their expectations often are disappointed . 
Indeed , these huge investments are frequently counterproductive . 
Many patients enter hospitals only to fall victim to largely preventable , potentially fatal , antimicrobial � resistant infections . 
These infections also prolong hospitalization and require additional diagnosis and treatment , generally with expensive , difficult � to � obtain antibiotics . 
The more advanced ( and expensive ) the care , the higher the risk . 
Danger is greatest in intensive care units ( ICUs ) . 
Concentrating large numbers of critically ill patients on a single ward facilitates transmission of disease � causing microorganisms via the hands of care � givers . 
Patients admitted to ICUs become colonized rapidly with hospital bacterial pathogens , which often are resistant to antibiotics . 
ICU patients are infection � prone because they are exposed to invasive devices ( such as intravenous or arterial catheters and mechanical ventilation ) , complex surgical procedures , and drugs that weaken the immune system . 
ICUs in developing countries not only have high rates of infection day � in and day � out , but also are subject to devastating outbreaks of lethal bloodstream infection and pneumonia due to contamination of equipment , medications , and other supplies . 
The widespread lack of appreciation of the importance of hospital � acquired infections among care � givers and policymakers in developing countries is disheartening . 
The thirst for technology is not accompanied by an appetite for infection control . 
On one occasion , my colleagues and I were invited to a public hospital in a developing country to investigate why the death rate in a pediatric ICU caring for patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever was so high . 
The prevailing theory held a virulent strain of the dengue virus responsible . 
Instead , we discovered that most of the children were dying from hospital � acquired bloodstream infection caused by the very devices that were supposed to save their lives - intravenous catheters , mechanical ventilators , and bladder drainage catheters . 
Though the equipment was adequate , infection control and staff training were not . 
A damp towel teaming with hospital bacterial pathogens was used to dry hands . 
Intravenous and bladder catheters were neither inserted nor maintained properly . 
Tubing for ventilators ( hung to dry over a hole in the floor used to dispose of urine and wastes ) was not disinfected correctly . 
We found innumerable other violations of basic infection control technique . 
Nonetheless , a bone marrow transplant unit , financed largely by Japan , had just opened in the same hospital - placing the most vulnerable patients at the mercy of deadly infections . 
Sound infection control costs only a mere fraction of even basic medical technologies . 
Granted , countries with limited resources cannot supply their hospitals with the full repertoire of infection controls available in wealthier nations . 
Yet , much can be done . 
Infection control principles , such as effective hand hygiene and good aseptic technique , are simple and easily taught . 
Even where safe water is unavailable , effective decontamination of hands can be accomplished in seconds by using a water � less , alcohol � based hand gel that costs a few US pennies if manufactured locally . 
Gloves , locally manufactured , can be reserved for high risk activities to prevent cross � infection among patients and protect care � givers from blood � borne infections . 
Proper disinfection of equipment is generally affordable ( especially in comparison to the cost of equipment itself ) , and contamination of medications and solutions can be avoided through training and vigilance . 
Deadly outbreaks of Lassa fever and Ebola have occurred among patients and care � givers in rural facilities simply because gloves and other personal protection necessary to prevent the spread of these blood � borne viruses were unavailable or , if available , not used properly . 
Experience shows that invasive devices , such as intra � vascular catheters , ventilators , and bladder catheters , tend to be overused in hospitals that have access to them , and tend to be left in place for longer than is medically necessary . 
This is the worst � case scenario - expensive material is wasted and the risk of infection increased . 
Overuse of antibiotics can also be curtailed by standardized protocols , thus reducing costs and retarding the emergence of resistance . 
Healthcare policy leaders and funding agencies should remember that even the most fearsome contagious diseases can yield to basic infection control training and equipment . 
But hospital � acquired infections must be given proper priority . 
If not , many investments in costly hospital facilities in the developing world may do more harm than good .
