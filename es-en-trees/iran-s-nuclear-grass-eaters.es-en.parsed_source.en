Iran &apos;s Nuclear Grass Eaters 
MADRID - After long years of failed international efforts to end Iran &apos;s cunning drive to develop nuclear weapons , the question today is no longer whether the West can prevent the nuclearization of Iran &apos;s military arsenal , but whether the Islamic regime collapses first . 
Unfortunately , if it does not , the only option for stopping Iran is war - and war is a very bad option . 
Pakistan is worth invoking when assessing whether the sanctions now imposed on Iran will force it to surrender its nuclear program . 
In 1965 , Pakistani Foreign Minister Zulficar Ali Bhutto famously declared that if India , its sworn enemy , went nuclear , his country would &quot; eat grass and even go hungry &quot; in order to develop a nuclear bomb of its own . 
Today , Pakistan , a near-failed state on the verge of disintegration , possesses more nuclear warheads than India . 
Iran &apos;s theocratic regime , immersed in a momentous struggle for survival against what it regards as an unholy alliance of Israel , the American &quot; Great Satan , &quot; and a surrounding Arab world that abhors its hegemonic ambitions , will not surrender its nuclear ambitions easily . 
Indeed , nuclear weapons appear to be the regime &apos;s only real route to self-preservation . 
The French and the Soviet revolutions taught us that exporting the revolution is one way to protect it . 
Iran tried that , and failed . 
The almost inevitable fall of Iran &apos;s closest ally in the region , the Baath regime in Syria , only adds to the regime &apos;s paranoid anxieties - and makes developing a nuclear capability seem all the more necessary for its survival . 
Iran &apos;s leaders might be ready to let their people &quot; eat grass and even go hungry &quot; for the sake of their nuclear ambitions , but Iran &apos;s squeezed middle class , one hopes , will not submit to such degradation . 
Social unrest has been building up in Iran for years , and certainly began well before the West became serious about imposing economic and financial sanctions . 
In fact , the popular revolts in Tunisia and Egypt were directly inspired by Iran &apos;s Green movement , which emerged during the massive post-election protests in 2009 , before succumbing to a brutal government crackdown . 
The sanctions against Iran have undoubtedly bitten hard . 
Indeed , Iran &apos;s economy is now firmly in the grip of a war panic . 
When a national currency loses 50 % of its value in a matter of weeks , economic collapse is at hand . 
Businessmen find it impossible to use the rial even for domestic transactions , because inflation is spiraling out of control . 
Commodity prices , moreover , are skyrocketing , and the cost of small and mid-size apartments has become prohibitive for a middle class severely hit by unemployment . 
Iran &apos;s backward economy , a third of which is controlled by the Revolutionary Guard , is simply incapable of offering job opportunities to Iran &apos;s growing cohorts of university graduates - the same segment of society that toppled the Shah . 
The problem has become increasingly acute , because 60 % of Iran &apos;s population was born after 1979 . 
Moreover , rapid population growth and bungled economic policy have made Iran excessively dependent on food imports . 
Yet , however crippling the effect of sanctions might be , they will not bring the regime to surrender its nuclear program . 
The most for which one can hope is that sanctions enhance the chances of regime change by reawakening popular protest , thereby triggering an Iranian version of the Arab Spring . 
This might be wishful thinking , however . 
But an attack by either Israel or the US on Iran &apos;s nuclear installations would be a calamitous mistake , or , as Meir Dagan , a former chief of Israel &apos;s Mossad intelligence service , put it , &quot; the stupidest idea &quot; possible . 
So it is to be hoped that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s war rhetoric and vulgar manipulation of the memory of the Holocaust are nothing more than a ploy to divert the world &apos;s attention from the Palestinian problem that he has done nothing to resolve . 
Alas , one cannot rule out a scenario in which nothing - diplomacy , sanctions , or the push for a regime change - works . 
In that case , one should not underestimate the pernicious effects of Israel &apos;s Holocaust complex . 
What led Israel to war in 1967 was not a sound assessment of Egypt &apos;s intentions to attack , but fear of a second Shoah . 
An attack on Iran might , however , produce precisely the effect that Netanyahu seeks to avoid . 
Post-war global diplomacy might have to promote , perhaps more robustly than ever , the creation a nuclear-weapons-free zone in the Middle East , and thus address Israel &apos;s nuclear capabilities , as well as the Palestinian problem - issues that Netanyahu has worked hard to ignore . 
But if the path of war is finally taken , and , in its aftermath , the international community fails once again to pacify the world &apos;s most dysfunctional region , the Middle East would devolve into an unruly chaos far more dangerous than the threat of an Iranian bomb .
