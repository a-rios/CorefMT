Memoirs of an Anti-Semite 
Romania &apos;s most vicious anti-Semitic and ultra-nationalist politician , Corneliu Vadim Tudor , is trying hard to persuade people that he has changed his ways . 
For most journalists and political pundits in Romania , this self-proclaimed Damascene conversion looks like just another political farce from someone with unrivaled histrionic gifts . 
If Tudor were a mere political clown , the question of whether or not he still hates Jews would not matter . 
As parliamentary and presidential elections loom , everyone wants to figure out just what he is up to . 
Tudor was ex-dictator Nicolae Ceausescu &apos;s court poet . 
He supported the Securitate ( Romania &apos;s communist-era secret police ) and praised Ceausescu &apos;s patriotism . 
When communism collapsed , he blamed every shortcoming in the reform process on &quot; foreigners &quot; - meaning the West , Romania &apos;s ethnic Hungarian minority , and especially the Jews . 
Indeed , he developed a cult for Marshall Ion Antonescu , Romania &apos;s dictator between 1940-1944 and Hitler &apos;s ally , who was responsible of ordering the massacre of about 200,000 Jews . 
The violence of Tudor &apos;s rhetoric , directed against everybody who opposed him , rose to heights not seen since the Fascist era . 
In 1990 , Tudor set up a weekly magazine through which he incited vicious and reactionary campaigns . 
Soon after he founded the extreme nationalist Greater Romania Party ( PRM ) , as well as a so-called &quot; national treason list , &quot; on which almost every notable political and cultural figure had his or her place . 
He threatened ( or promised ) that criminals would be herded into stadiums and machine-gunned should he come to power . 
Although Tudor faced innumerable lawsuits for libel , he could not be silenced . 
In the 2000 general election , as the ruling center-right coalition imploded , the PRM received about 20 % of the popular vote , becoming the second-largest party in parliament . 
Tudor subsequently finished second in the presidential election . 
Then , suddenly , a few months ago , Tudor announced that he had undergone a religious experience and had changed his mind about the Jews . 
He admitted that he had been anti-Semitic , but he claimed that God had opened his eyes and that he now loved Jews as much as he used to hate them . 
Indeed , he began apologizing for his earlier anti-Semitic hate speech . 
The man who once said that he could &quot; well imagine world culture without Jews &quot; now claimed to realize how quintessential the Jews are for world culture . 
He announced that he had hired Eyal Arad , a well-known Israeli spin-doctor , to run his presidential campaign . 
&quot; The Jews &quot; were not his enemies any more , he said ; they were even working for him . 
But Tudor didn &apos;t stop with prolix apologies . 
He soon sponsored the unveiling of a bust of the assassinated Israeli premier Yitzak Rabin at Brasov in Transylvania . 
For the occasion , Tudor wore a yarmulke and spoke about his &quot; philo-Semitism &quot; for more than two hours . 
Other PRM representatives , provided with yarmulkes by Tudor , shuffled their feet awkwardly . 
A chorus sang Romanian and Jewish songs and everybody expressed the vow that Vadim would be the &quot; next and the first Christian President &quot; of Romania , the yarmulke notwithstanding ! 
Next , Tudor headed a PRM delegation to lay a wreath at Auschwitz , where the one-time Holocaust denier declared that Jews had been exterminated in Romania . 
What lies behind this political opportunism ? 
Tudor knows that his electoral success in 2000 belongs to the past . 
At the local elections held in June , the PRM did poorly . 
The really big battle this November will be joined by the Social Democrats ( PDSR ) and by the centrist alliance Democratic Alliance . 
Tudor has no chance of becoming &quot; the first Christian President of Romania . &quot; 
His only chance of gaining even a share of power is to join in a future coalition , and for this he has to look semi-respectable . 
In fact , Tudor &apos;s strategy may work , because the ex-communist PDSR , led by President Ion Iliescu and Prime Minister Adrian Nastase , will probably not oppose such an alliance if it is necessary to give them a majority after November &apos;s general election . 
They are desperate to cling to power , no matter what , and so are unlikely to question Tudor &apos;s democratic pedigree . 
After all , they governed together with the PRM from1992 to 1996 . 
Yet , there is a hitch : Romania is due to join the EU in 2007 , and with the PRM in the government but branded as an extremist , anti-Semitic party , the integration process could be derailed . 
No EU government will want to invite into the club an administration that contains Romania &apos;s far uglier version of Le Pen and Haider . 
This is why Tudor desperately needs a patina of democratic respectability . 
Tudor seems to hope that by putting on a yarmulke and repenting his anti-Semitism , he will deceive a few naive Western politicians . 
But no one should be fooled . 
Despite his political zigzags , Tudor has been extremely consistent . 
He has always thought and written that &quot; the Jews &quot; brought capitalism , communism , spiritualism , alcoholism , decadent Hollywood movies , and pornography to Romania . 
But saying that publicly won &apos;t work anymore , not because Romanians do not think this way ( many certainly do ) , but because the political class from left to right wants to be part of Europe and won &apos;t associate with anyone who puts that desire at risk . 
So Tudor &apos;s embrace of the Jews is a conversion of convenience . 
If Paris was worth a mass to the French kings of old , Bucharest is worth a yarmulke to Tudor .
