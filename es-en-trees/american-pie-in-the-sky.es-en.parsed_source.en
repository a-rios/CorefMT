American Pie in the Sky 
NEW YORK - While the risk of a disorderly crisis in the eurozone is well recognized , a more sanguine view of the United States has prevailed . 
For the last three years , the consensus has been that the US economy was on the verge of a robust and self-sustaining recovery that would restore above-potential growth . 
That turned out to be wrong , as a painful process of balance-sheet deleveraging - reflecting excessive private-sector debt , and then its carryover to the public sector - implies that the recovery will remain , at best , below-trend for many years to come . 
Even this year , the consensus got it wrong , expecting a recovery to above-trend annual GDP growth - faster than 3 % . 
But the first-half growth rate looks set to come in closer to 1.5 % at best , even below 2011 &quot; s dismal 1.7 % . 
And now , after getting the first half of 2012 wrong , many are repeating the fairy tale that a combination of lower oil prices , rising auto sales , recovering house prices , and a resurgence of US manufacturing will boost growth in the second half of the year and fuel above-potential growth by 2013 . 
The reality is the opposite : for several reasons , growth will slow further in the second half of 2012 and be even lower in 2013 - close to stall speed . 
First , growth in the second quarter has decelerated from a mediocre 1.8 % in January-March , as job creation - averaging 70,000 a month - fell sharply . 
Second , expectations of the &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; - automatic tax increases and spending cuts set for the end of this year - will keep spending and growth lower through the second half of 2012 . 
So will uncertainty about who will be President in 2013 ; about tax rates and spending levels ; about the threat of another government shutdown over the debt ceiling ; and about the risk of another sovereign rating downgrade should political gridlock continue to block a plan for medium-term fiscal consolidation . 
In such conditions , most firms and consumers will be cautious about spending - an option value of waiting - thus further weakening the economy . 
Third , the fiscal cliff would amount to a 4.5 % -of-GDP drag on growth in 2013 if all tax cuts and transfer payments were allowed to expire and draconian spending cuts were triggered . 
Of course , the drag will be much smaller , as tax increases and spending cuts will be much milder . 
But , even if the fiscal cliff turns out to be a mild growth bump - a mere 0.5 % of GDP - and annual growth at the end of the year is just 1.5 % , as seems likely , the fiscal drag will suffice to slow the economy to stall speed : a growth rate of barely 1 % . 
Fourth , private consumption growth in the last few quarters does not reflect growth in real wages ( which are actually falling ) . 
Rather , growth in disposable income ( and thus in consumption ) has been sustained since last year by another $ 1.4 trillion in tax cuts and extended transfer payments , implying another $ 1.4 trillion of public debt . 
Unlike the eurozone and the United Kingdom , where a double-dip recession is already under way , owing to front-loaded fiscal austerity , the US has prevented some household deleveraging through even more public-sector releveraging - that is , by stealing some growth from the future . 
In 2013 , as transfer payments are phased out , however gradually , and as some tax cuts are allowed to expire , disposable income growth and consumption growth will slow . 
The US will then face not only the direct effects of a fiscal drag , but also its indirect effect on private spending . 
Fifth , four external forces will further impede US growth : a worsening eurozone crisis ; an increasingly hard landing for China ; a generalized slowdown of emerging-market economies , owing to cyclical factors ( weak advanced-country growth ) and structural causes ( a state-capitalist model that reduces potential growth ) ; and the risk of higher oil prices in 2013 as negotiations and sanctions fail to convince Iran to abandon its nuclear program . 
Policy responses will have very limited effect in stemming the US economy &apos;s deceleration toward stall speed : even with only a mild fiscal drag on growth , the US dollar is likely to strengthen as the eurozone crisis weakens the euro and as global risk aversion returns . 
The US Federal Reserve will carry out more quantitative easing this year , but it will be ineffective : long-term interest rates are already very low , and lowering them further would not boost spending . 
Indeed , the credit channel is frozen and velocity has collapsed , with banks hoarding increases in base money in the form of excess reserves . 
Moreover , the dollar is unlikely to weaken as other countries also carry out quantitative easing . 
Similarly , the gravity of weaker growth will most likely overcome the levitational effect on equity prices from more quantitative easing , particularly given that equity valuations today are not as depressed as they were in 2009 or 2010 . 
Indeed , growth in earnings and profits is now running out of steam , as the effect of weak demand on top-line revenues takes a toll on bottom-line margins and profitability . 
A significant equity-price correction could , in fact , be the force that in 2013 tips the US economy into outright contraction . 
And if the US ( still the world &apos;s largest economy ) starts to sneeze again , the rest of the world - its immunity already weakened by Europe &apos;s malaise and emerging countries &quot; slowdown - will catch pneumonia .
