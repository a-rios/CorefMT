Divided We Fall 
LONDON - Politics trumped sensible economics in the United States this summer , when Congress and President Barack Obama could not agree on taxes , entitlements , deficits , or an investment stimulus . 
Europe &apos;s leaders were also paralyzed - ruling out defaults and devaluations , as well as deficits and stimulus . 
And , having run negative real interest rates , printed money , plowed in liquidity , and subsidized commercial banks , central bankers everywhere - most recently US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke - appear to have concluded that they , too , have reached the limit of what they can do . 
As a result , few people today doubt that the world is drifting , rudderless and leaderless , towards a second downturn . 
The pre-summer debate about whether we faced a &quot; new normal &quot; of slower growth has been resolved : nothing now looks normal . 
Muddling through has failed . 
Unable to conclude a global trade deal , climate-change agreement , growth pact , or changes in the financial regime , the world is likely to descend into a new protectionism of competitive devaluation , currency wars , trade restrictions , and capital controls . 
But this is not a time for defeatism . 
Countries claiming to have reached the limit of what they can do really mean that they have reached the limit of what they can do on their own . 
The way forward to sustained growth and employment is not through a flurry of one-off national initiatives , but rather through global policy coordination . 
That was the goal back in April 2009 , when the G-20 set itself three critical tasks . 
The first , preventing a global depression , was achieved . 
The other two - a growth pact , underpinned by a reformed global financial system - should now be the main items on the G-20 &quot; s agenda when it meets . 
In 2010 , the International Monetary Fund estimated that a coordinated approach to macroeconomic , trade , and structural policies could achieve 5.5 % higher global GDP , create 25-50 million additional jobs , and lift 90 million people out of poverty . 
But a global growth pact looks even more indispensable today , given the world economy &apos;s structural problems and huge imbalances between production and consumption . 
It may seem strange to describe the greatest financial crisis since the 1930 &quot; s as a symptom of a bigger problem . 
But , when historians look back on the wave of globalization after 1990 - which has brought two billion new producers into the world economy - they will find a turning point around 2010 . 
For the first time in 150 years , the West ( America and the European Union ) was out-manufactured , out-produced , out-exported , out-traded , and out-invested by the rest of the world . 
Indeed , by the early to mid-2020 &quot; s , the Asian consumer market will be twice the size of the US market . 
Today , however , the West and Asia remain mutually dependent . 
Two-thirds of Asia &apos;s exports still end up in the West , and south-south trade accounts for just 20 % of global turnover . 
Put another way , ten years ago the US engine could drive the world economy , and ten years from now the emerging-market countries stand to take over that role , particularly given the rising purchasing power of their middle classes . 
But , for now , America and Europe cannot expand their consumer spending without increasing exports , while China and the emerging markets cannot easily expand their production or consumption without the guarantee of strong Western markets . 
So , first , we must restore the broad vision of global cooperation contained in the G-20 growth pact ( which has since been downgraded to what the IMF now calls &quot; an in-depth analysis of ... those countries identified as having large imbalances &quot; ) . 
But a broader and deeper agenda is needed : China should agree to raise household spending and consumer imports ; 
India should open its markets so that its poor can benefit from low-cost imports ; and Europe and America must boost competitiveness in order to increase their exports . 
The G-20 was also adamant in 2009 that future stability required a new global financial regime . 
David Miles of the Bank of England predicts three more financial crises in the coming two decades . 
And , if the BoE &apos;s Andrew Haldane is right that rising pressures in Asia threaten future turmoil , the West will regret its failure to entrench global capital-adequacy and liquidity standards and a more transparent early-warning system . 
The problem is already evident . 
Europe &apos;s banking-sector liabilities are nearly five times higher than in the US , at 345 % of GDP . 
Germany &apos;s banks are leveraged at 32 times their assets . 
So , not only is bank recapitalization essential for financial stability , but so is a reformed euro , built on fiscal and monetary coordination and an enhanced role for the European Central Bank in supporting individual governments ( not individual banks ) as lender of last resort . 
The G-20 will not achieve growth and stability without a renewed focus on long-term debt reduction . 
But there is also a short-term imperative to avoid a cycle of decline . 
So we should draw on Robert Skidelsky &apos;s national investment bank proposals to equip our infrastructure - not least our environment - for future challenges and to stimulate growth and job creation . 
One model is the European Investment Bank , which , with € 50 billion of capital , has been able to invest € 400 billion . 
But there is perhaps a deal to be done with the Chinese on investing their reserves and with Western multinationals on the tax treatment of repatriated profits . 
Finally , as the Nobel laureate economist Michael Spence has shown , growth is now a necessary but insufficient condition for job creation . 
Today &apos;s epidemic of youth unemployment , in particular , requires new approaches - a development bank , for example , to help employ the bulging youth population in the Middle East and North Africa , and training and apprenticeship programs elsewhere . 
The G-20 &quot; s growth compact must be a jobs compact , too . 
The G-20 , which represents 80 % of world output , came into its own in 2009 as the only multilateral body able to coordinate global economic policy . 
Unfortunately , its member states soon abandoned that goal and defaulted to national solutions . 
Predictably , going it alone has proven futile in ensuring economic recovery . 
The G-20 &quot; s time has come again . 
The sooner French President Nicolas Sarkozy calls the G-20 together to act , the better .
