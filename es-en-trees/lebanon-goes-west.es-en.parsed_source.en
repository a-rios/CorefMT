Lebanon Goes West 
BEIRUT - Lebanon &apos;s voters have handed a clear defeat to the Hezbollah-led March 8 alliance . 
In a smoothly run and peaceful election , the pro-Western March 14 alliance emerged with a clear majority of 71 seats , compared to 58 seats for its rivals . 
The results elicited a nearly audible sigh of relief from Arab capitals , as well as from leaders in Europe and North America . 
The fear that the pro-Syrian and pro-Iranian March 8 alliance might secure a victory was palpable prior to the vote . 
Iran &apos;s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had eagerly and publicly anticipated such an outcome . 
The March 14 Alliance &apos;s victory is good news for Lebanon and the region , ensuring good relations with Lebanon &apos;s Arab and Western friends , and constituting a quiet triumph for moderation and pragmatism over extremism and confrontation . 
It is also good news for the Obama administration , which had feared a regional setback soon after Obama &apos;s historic address in Cairo on June 4 . 
The election also brings a much needed measure of stability and legitimacy to the governing March 14 coalition , which comprises the mainly Sunni Future movement , led by Saad Hariri ( son of slain former Prime Minister Rafik al Hariri ) , the Socialist party , led by Druze leader Walid Junblat , and a number of Christian parties . 
Although the March 14 coalition already controlled Parliament , its majority had been repeatedly attacked as the result of a severely skewed election law . 
Although the March 8 alliance lost the election , not all of its members were equally distressed by the results . 
Aside from Hezbollah , March 8 includes the more secular Shiite Amal movement and the Free Patriotic Movement , a large Christian group led by General Michel Aoun . 
Whereas Hezbollah and Amal swept the Shiite districts in the South and the Beqaa Valley , confirming their dominant position among Lebanon &apos;s Shiites , Aoun delivered less than half the Christian votes . 
Hezbollah may be quite comfortable with the returns . Winning would have placed Hezbollah in a challenging position . 
Arab and international governments would have reacted negatively , and investor confidence in Lebanon would have been undermined , jeopardizing Lebanon &apos;s political and economic relations . 
A victory for the March 8 alliance also would have strengthened Israel &apos;s argument that Hezbollah dominates Lebanon , leaving the country more exposed to attack . 
Moreover , if the March 8 coalition had won , it would have largely been on the back of Christian voters delivered by Aoun , who might have then demanded the Lebanese presidency , which is reserved for a Christian . 
Neither Hezbollah nor Amal wanted this . 
With a March 14 victory , Hezbollah is more secure vis-Ã -vis Israeli attack or international isolation , can worry less about managing Lebanon &apos;s economy and finances , and can maintain its alliance with Aoun without delivering him the Moon . 
Moving forward , the immediate challenge will be to form the next government . 
The March 14 alliance has said that it would welcome a national unity government with the March 8 coalition , but without the veto power that the opposition has been demanding . 
This wrangling is likely to take weeks , but is unlikely to come to blows or to reach a complete impasse . 
Neither side is interested in escalation or a breakdown . 
Their patrons in the region and internationally - Saudi Arabia , the United States , Syria , and Iran - are also more interested in negotiation than escalation at this point . 
On matters of national sovereignty , the new government must continue to build up the national army and police forces , negotiate with Hezbollah over the integration of its militia into the state security structure , and push for regional peace , which would strongly benefit Lebanon . 
With regard to economic and social policy , the government must manage the national debt while encouraging investment and employment and strengthening public education and health programs . 
The government must also move forward on further electoral reform , expand administrative decentralization , hold local elections in 2010 , and come up with a credible program to combat rampant corruption . 
None of these challenges will be easy . 
Lebanon has undergone much in the past four years : the withdrawal of Syrian forces , a string of painful assassinations , a devastating 2006 war with Israel , a difficult battle between the Lebanese army and an entrenched terrorist group called Fateh al-Islam , a year and a half of institutional paralysis between late 2006 and early 2008 , and a brief civil war in the streets of Beirut in May 2008 . 
However , since then , Lebanon has put together a coalition government , regained security and stability , weathered the global economic crisis , and now organized a largely free and fair election . 
Much of this has been achieved through regional and international assistance , but on June 7 the Lebanese people , through the ballot box , proved that they hold ultimate decision-making power over the country &apos;s precarious but potentially promising future .
