France &apos;s Path Not Taken 
The new president of France , be it Nicolas Sarkozy or Ségolène Royal , will face a tough challenge when it comes to putting the French economy back on its feet . 
While the world economy is booming for the fourth consecutive year , with a historically unprecedented growth rate of about 5 % , the French economy is limping . 
In 2006 , it grew by only 2.2 % , while growth rates of only 2.1 % and 1.9 % can be expected for 2007 and 2008 , respectively , according to a recent forecast by the German Economic Research Institutes . 
This is significantly below the average of the old EU countries for these three years - 2.7 % , 2.6 % , and 2.4 % , respectively . 
France is currently one of Europe &apos;s laggards , only slightly ahead of Italy and Portugal . 
Even Germany is performing better . 
With a growth rate of 2.7 % , the German economy clawed its way back to the average of the old EU countries in 2006 , and it can be expected to grow at 2.4 % in 2007 and 2008 , far faster than France . 
France &apos;s meager growth is surprising . 
Until recently , the economy was doing fairly well , outperforming many EU countries . 
While Germany grew by only 14 % in the ten years from 1995 to 2005 , ranking as Europe &apos;s &quot; vice-laggard &quot; next to Italy , France grew by 23.6 % , which was nearly the old EU countries &quot; average of 24.3 % . 
In 2001 , France &apos;s gross national income per capita overtook that of Germany , and is now 4 % higher . 
And yet recent growth figures seem to have reversed this trend for the time being . 
French employment data has been worrisome for even longer . 
In 2006 , France &apos;s unemployment rate was 9.4 % , a full percentage point higher than Germany &apos;s . 
By 2008 , the French rate can be expected to decline only to 8.2 % , while German unemployment is anticipated to fall to 6.3 % . 
A similar pattern holds for public debt . 
While Germany has resolved its debt problem insofar as it no longer violates the European Union &apos;s Stability and Growth Pact and can be expected to have a balanced budget in 2008 , the forecasts for France imply deficits of 2.6 % and 2.3 % of GDP for this year and 2008 . 
If the boom in the world economy falters , France will again violate the Stability and Growth Pact , as it did in 2002 , 2003 , and 2004 . 
Why are France and Germany behaving so differently during this global boom ? 
Among the potential explanations , the dissimilar specializations of each country stand out . 
While France has specialized in consumer goods such as food and pharmaceutical products , Germany is a leading exporter of investment goods . 
As the current boom in the world economy is largely fueled by investment demand rather consumption demand , only Germany profits from it to full measure . 
Germany is the tool-shop of the world , with 450 world market leaders in niche products and another 500 companies in the top-three category . 
Fifteen of the world &apos;s 20 biggest trade fairs ( measured by indoor exhibition space ) are held in Germany , and the country tops the list in world commodity exports . 
Small wonder , then , that Germany &apos;s economy rockets when the world &apos;s demand for capital goods soars . 
True , Germany has its share of problems . 
The country is gradually turning into an industrial bazaar that is relocating its workbench to low-wage ex-communist countries . 
This is one of the reasons why the boom of 2006 was incapable of creating additional jobs in German manufacturing ; why Germany still has the OECD &apos;s highest unemployment among low-skilled workers ; and why aggregate full-time employment has not yet returned to its level in 2000 . 
The French economy could be slightly more stable in the medium term insofar as it seems to have more solid internal sectors . 
But Germany definitely is partaking more of the current boom than France does . 
Perhaps one French mistake was to neglect its small and medium-size firms and specialize too much on state-controlled mega-companies . 
Airbus , Renault , Crédit Lyonnais , and Alstom are well-known examples of a mistaken industrial policy that has wasted French taxpayers &quot; money - and that is partly connected with the name Sarkozy . 
The true problem for France is the huge chunk of state-owned companies that go through the motions without being particularly successful in the market . 
In France , 25 % of dependent employees work in the government sector , compared with 19 % in the old EU and 12 % in Germany . 
The French government share in GDP is 54 % , while Germany &apos;s is only 47 % . 
In France , more than 7 % of voters cast their ballots for Trotskyite and Communist candidates in the first round of the presidential election , while the Socialists , who received 27 % of the votes , are much more left-leaning than Germany &apos;s Social Democrats . 
Dirigiste attitudes are more popular in France than in most other European countries . 
To the extent that these attitudes may have led to a political system in which small and medium-size firms find it difficult to flourish , they may have contributed to France &apos;s problems . 
It remains to be seen whether the new French president will be able to embark on a more promising course . 
The odds are not good . 
Royal will do nothing to increase the flexibility of the French labor market so as to facilitate structural change and enable new firms to be created , while Sarkozy is likely to continue to support France &apos;s lumbering giants , as he as done so frequently in the past . 
Sound policy aimed at reviving the economy seems beyond the grasp of both candidates .
