The Corporate-Tax Conundrum 
BERKELEY - The United States now has the highest statutory corporate-income tax rate among developed countries . 
Even after various deductions , credits , and other tax breaks , the effective marginal rate - the rate that corporations pay on new US investments - remains one of the highest in the world . 
In a world of mobile capital , corporate-tax rates matter , and business decisions about how and where to invest are increasingly sensitive to national differences . 
America &apos;s relatively high rate encourages US companies to locate their investment , production , and employment in foreign countries , and discourages foreign companies from locating in the US , which means slower growth , fewer jobs , smaller productivity gains , and lower real wages . 
According to conventional wisdom , the corporate-tax burden is borne principally by the owners of capital in the form of lower returns . 
But , as capital becomes more mobile , relatively immobile workers are bearing more of the burden in the form of lower wages and fewer job opportunities . 
That is why countries around the world have been cutting their corporate-tax rates . 
The resulting &quot; race to the bottom &quot; reflects intensifying global competition for capital and technological knowhow to support local jobs and wages . 
Moreover , a high corporate-tax rate is an ineffective and costly tool for producing revenues , owing to innovative financial transactions and legal tax-avoidance mechanisms . 
A company &apos;s legal residence and geographic sources of income can be and are manipulated for such purposes , and the incentives and scope for such manipulation are especially large in sectors where competitive advantage depends on intangible capital and knowledge - sectors that play a major role in the US economy &apos;s competitiveness . 
In the absence of close and broad international cooperation , the US must join the race and lower its corporate-tax rate . 
A lower rate would strengthen incentives for investment and job creation in the US , and weaken incentives for tax avoidance . 
It would also reduce numerous efficiency-reducing distortions in the US tax code , including substantial tax advantages for debt financing over equity financing and for non-corporate businesses over corporate businesses . 
But each percentage-point reduction in the corporate-tax rate would reduce federal revenues by about $ 12 billion per year . 
These revenue losses could be offset by curtailing so-called &quot; corporate-tax expenditures &quot; - deductions , credits , and other special tax provisions that subsidize some economic activities while penalizing others - and broadening the corporate-tax base . 
Both President Barack Obama &apos;s plan for business-tax reform and the Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction plan propose reducing such expenditures to pay for a reduction in the corporate-tax rate . 
Corporate-tax expenditures narrow the base , raise the cost of tax compliance , and distort decisions about investment projects , how to finance them , what form of business organization to adopt , and where to produce . 
As Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney show in a just-released report , the resulting differences in effective tax rates for different kinds of business activity are substantial . 
That said , if the goal of corporate-tax reform is to boost investment and job creation , broadening the tax base to pay for a lower rate could be counterproductive . 
Eliminating &quot; special interest &quot; loopholes , like tax breaks for oil and gas , or for corporate jets , would not yield enough revenue to pay for a meaningful rate cut . 
And curtailing accelerated depreciation , the manufacturing production deduction , and the R D tax credit - which account for about 80 % of corporate-tax expenditures - would involve significant tradeoffs . 
Indeed , cutting these items to &quot; pay for &quot; a reduction in the corporate-tax rate could end up increasing the tax on corporate economic activity in the US . 
Instead of cutting proven tax incentives for business investment , the US should offset at least some of the revenue losses from a lower corporate-tax rate by raising tax rates on corporate shareholders . 
Most countries that reduced their corporate-tax rates have followed this path , while the US has done the opposite . 
At 15 % , America &apos;s tax rates on dividends and capital gains are at historic lows , while the profit share of national income is at an all-time high . 
Defenders of low rates for capital owners argue that it minimizes &quot; double &quot; taxation of corporate income - first of the corporation and then of its shareholders . 
A lower corporate-tax rate would weaken this justification . 
Moreover , pension funds , retirement plans , and non-profit organizations , which receive about 50 % of all corporate dividends , do not pay tax on these earnings , and would benefit from a lower corporate-tax rate . 
Although individual taxes on corporate income reduce the after-tax return to savings , they have less distorting effects on investment location than corporate taxes do , and they are more likely to fall on owners of capital than on workers . 
Moreover , it is far easier to collect taxes from individual citizens and resident shareholders than from multinational corporations . 
Apple can use sophisticated techniques to manipulate the location of its corporate income , but individual US citizens who own Apple stock have to report the dividends and capital gains that they earn from it in their worldwide income . 
A recent study found that taxing capital gains and dividends as ordinary income , subject to a maximum 28 % rate on long-term capital gains ( the pre-1997 rate ) , could finance a cut in the corporate-tax rate from 35 % to 26 % . 
Such a change would reduce corporations &quot; incentives to move investments abroad or shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions , while increasing the progressivity of tax outcomes by shifting more of the burden of corporate taxation from labor to capital owners . 
An increase in the corporate-tax rate appeals to many US voters who believe that corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes and are worried about widening income inequality . 
But , in a world of mobile capital , raising the corporate tax rate - or simply leaving it at its current level - would be a bad way to generate revenue , a bad way to increase the tax system &apos;s progressivity , and a bad way to help American workers .
