Middle East Points of Light 
ISTANBUL - I started my political career in 1991 - the same year as the first Gulf War and the Middle East Peace Conference in Madrid . 
The leaders of the time were well aware of the complex links between the Palestine problem and other challenges in the Middle East . 
Since that time , I have witnessed many initiatives , plans , and projects for resolving various Middle East conflicts . 
Needless to say , my country , Turkey , has always been at the forefront of the international community &apos;s efforts to secure peace , stability , and cooperation in the region , and I contributed to some of them as a member of parliament , prime minister , foreign minister , and finally as President . 
Unfortunately , despite an immense expenditure of energy and resources spanning a quarter-century , these efforts have not yielded the desired results . 
Modest progress has been either sabotaged or insufficient , even as thousands of innocent people , both in the Middle East and beyond , have fallen victim to violence , hatred , and vengeance . 
The massacre of civilians ( including many children ) in Gaza last summer , the barbarity of ISIS , the murder of rabbis at a Jerusalem synagogue , and the terrorist attack in Ottawa last October - all convey a simple truth : violence is contagious . 
In 1991 , Saddam Hussein was the only regional threat ; today , the threats have multiplied , with cumulative effect . 
In 1991 , the United States and the Soviet Union jointly sponsored the Madrid Peace Conference ; today , the US and Russia are barely on speaking terms . 
But , though regional and international actors are deeply frustrated by the further aggravation of the Middle East &apos;s problems , more pessimism will only make matters worse . 
So let us try to draw some lessons from a scattering of positive signals and trends in recent months . 
For starters , the removal from Syria of the Assad regime &apos;s stockpile of chemical weapons shows that joint efforts can yield positive results . 
Likewise , by agreeing to extend the international negotiations on Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the parties to the talks have kept alive the promise of a final deal , which would be a great victory for multilateral diplomacy . 
Successful nuclear talks with Iran ( in which I have been involved , as Foreign Minister and President , at various stages ) would have major strategic , political , and economic consequences for the Middle East and the world . 
A solution might motivate Iran to facilitate the resolution of other regional problems . 
Moreover , other powers in the region that have or are believed to have a nuclear arsenal will have no excuse to oppose disarmament . 
The establishment of a more inclusive Iraqi government - enabled by the common sense and coordinated efforts of actors within and outside of the country - is also a positive sign , as are steps toward resolving disagreements between the Kurdistan Regional Government and the central authorities in Baghdad . 
The KRG &apos;s decision not to insist on holding a referendum on independence augurs well for stability in Iraq and the region . 
The same can be said of the coalition formed against ISIS . 
But , though military gains are now visible , &quot; hard &quot; power alone will not be enough to defeat the group . 
Ultimately , the solution lies in patiently building an inclusive political framework that wins the support of local people and leaders who , despairing and fearful , have been lured to the extremists &quot; cause . 
Though the use of hard power against ISIS may not have run its course , the mistakes made in Afghanistan , Iraq , Libya , and Syria must not be repeated : strategies for military exit and political transition must be considered without delay . 
Moreover , because ISIS is a phenomenon that crystalizes all of the region &apos;s political , ideological , economic , and social pathologies , possible solutions must be bold and comprehensive . 
Likewise , the decision by some European governments , parties , and parliaments to recognize the state of Palestine is a welcome development . 
This trend reflects disappointment with the current diplomatic deadlock , for which the blame should be squarely on Israel , not the Palestinians . 
The hope is that this trend will encourage the efforts of parties in Israel and Palestine that want a just solution . 
It is in everybody &apos;s interest that Israel &apos;s government acts with restraint regarding West Bank settlement and the status of Jerusalem and its holy sites . 
Finally , though the Arab Spring has been stifled everywhere ( with the sole exception of Tunisia ) , the expectations , yearnings , and concerns of the region &apos;s people remain alive and valid . 
The demands that defined the Arab Spring - for democracy , good governance , human rights , transparency , gender equality , and social justice - will continue to shape the regional agenda . 
The question is how to consolidate these gains and nurture progress . 
One potentially constructive initiative would be to establish a security system similar to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe . 
This vision , which has been around since the 1980s , should be kept alive , despite - or precisely because of - the unfavorable conditions for its creation . 
Because such a mechanism would require a strong economic-cooperation dimension , encompassing energy and water issues , it would encourage long-term strategic thinking and anchor multilateral efforts to resolve problems as they arise . 
For now , the turmoil engulfing the Middle East is like nothing we have seen before . 
Only by building upon positive developments and visions can regional peace and stability be restored and secured . 
The alternative may be too grim for even a pessimist to imagine .
