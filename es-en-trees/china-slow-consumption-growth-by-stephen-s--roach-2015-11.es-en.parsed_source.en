China &apos;s Macro Disconnect 
NEW HAVEN - Structural change and rebalancing are formidable undertakings for any economy . 
China has been focused on these objectives for five years - seeking to transform a powerful yet unbalanced growth model based largely on exports and investment into one driven increasingly by its consumers . 
Success is essential if China is to avoid the dreaded &quot; middle-income trap &quot; - the economic slowdown that most fast-growing developing economies experience when they reach income thresholds comparable to that of China today . 
The results have been mixed . 
China has been highly successful in its initial efforts to shift the industrial structure of its economy from manufacturing to services , which have long been viewed as the foundation of modern consumer societies . 
But it has made far less progress in boosting private consumption . 
China now has no choice but to address this disconnect head on . 
The performance of China &apos;s services sector has been especially impressive in recent years , with its share of GDP increasing from 44 % in 2010 to 51.6 % in the first three quarters of 2015 , according to official statistics . 
That is nearly double the four-percentage-point increase that was initially envisioned in the 12th Five-Year Plan , which is about to come to an end . 
The gains have been particularly strong in the distribution sectors - wholesale and retail trade - as well as in finance and real estate . 
And China &apos;s shift to services has only just begun . 
It should broaden into IT services , healthcare , domestic transportation , and hospitality and leisure , as the sector as a whole climbs toward a 60-65 % share of GDP over the next decade . 
By contrast , consumer-led growth has been much slower to materialize . 
After bottoming out at 36 % of GDP in 2010 , private consumption &apos;s share of GDP inched up to 38 % in 2014 - a two-percentage-point increase that is only about one-fourth the magnitude of the services-led shift in the economy &apos;s structure . 
With its prowess in central planning , China has always been adept at engineering shifts in its industrial structure - as the move toward services-led growth attests . 
But China apparently is far less proficient in replicating the DNA of a modern consumer culture - specifically , in altering the behavioral norms of its people . 
The disconnect between surging services and lagging growth in private consumption has been accompanied by a steady rise in China &apos;s urban saving rate to 30 % in 2014 ( versus 24 % a decade earlier ) . 
This has occurred despite a significant increase in the personal income share of the Chinese economy , driven by services-led employment growth and the income leverage of urbanization . 
Chinese families have been reluctant to convert much of this newfound income into discretionary spending . 
China &apos;s high and rising urban saving rate in a climate of vigorous per capita income growth reflects a persistent preference for precautionary saving over discretionary consumption . 
Unfortunately , this is a rational response to the uncertain future faced by the majority of Chinese families , underscored by the lack of a reliable social safety net . 
Moreover , anxiety over inadequate provisions for retirement and health care is set to intensify as a rapidly aging population now enters the most vulnerable phase of its life cycle . 
The good news is that the 13th Five-Year Plan ( covering the 2016-2020 period ) , which is to be enacted in March 2016 , appears likely to address these concerns explicitly . 
Early indications from the Fifth Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China , held in late October , suggest that the next plan will focus on the missing piece of consumer-led rebalancing : a strong social safety net . 
A proposed consolidation of rural and urban plans for pensions and critical health care is particularly important in this regard , as is the authorities &quot; commitment to allowing workers to transfer their hukou ( residency permits ) - and the associated social welfare benefits - wherever they move . 
For China &apos;s 270 million migrant workers , benefit portability could be decisive in shifting the balance from fear and precautionary saving to security and discretionary spending . 
Equally significant was the Fifth Plenum &apos;s emphasis on using state capital to fund a more robust safety net through an increase in taxes on state-owned enterprises that was proposed a couple of years ago . 
But the biggest breakthrough in reshaping societal norms was in family-planning policy - replacing the one-child limit that had been in force since 1980 with a two-child limit beginning in 2017 . 
Aimed at addressing China &apos;s serious aging problem , the eventual consequences of this long-overdue shift cannot be minimized . 
As the family unit , central to China &apos;s Confucian heritage , changes , so will the country &apos;s social and economic character . 
Over the past 35 years , China &apos;s powerful growth model has yielded extraordinary progress in terms of economic growth and development . 
But speedy implementation of the shift from production to consumption will be vital if the country is to remain on course and avoid the middle-income trap . 
That will require resolving the disconnect between the structural shift to services and the behavioral norms that will ultimately shape the spending habits of its people . 
And that means overcoming the understandable caution of Chinese households in the face of an uncertain future . 
Converting fear into confidence is a daunting task for any society . 
The focus on resolving China &apos;s macroeconomic disconnect , reflected at the Fifth Plenum and a likely precursor of what to expect in the upcoming 13th Five-Year Plan , is thus very encouraging .
