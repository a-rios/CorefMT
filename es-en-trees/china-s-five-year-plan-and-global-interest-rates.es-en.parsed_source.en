China &apos;s Five-Year Plan and Global Interest Rates 
CAMBRIDGE - China &apos;s new five-year plan will have important implications for the global economy . 
Its key feature is to shift official policy from maximizing GDP growth toward raising consumption and average workers &quot; standard of living . 
Although this change is driven by Chinese domestic considerations , it could have a significant impact on global capital flows and interest rates . 
China &apos;s high rate of GDP growth over the past decade has , of course , raised the real incomes of hundreds of millions of Chinese , particularly those living in or near urban areas . 
But real wages and consumption have grown more slowly than China &apos;s total GDP . 
Much of the income from GDP growth went to large state-owned enterprises , which strengthened their monopoly power . 
China now plans to raise the relative growth rate of real wages and to encourage increased consumer spending . 
There will also be more emphasis on expanding service industries and less on manufacturing . 
State-owned enterprises will be forced to distribute more of their profits . 
The rising value of the renminbi will induce Chinese manufacturers to shift their emphasis from export markets to production for markets at home . 
All of this will mean a reduction in national saving and an increase in spending by households and the Chinese government . 
China now has the world &apos;s highest saving rate , probably close to 50 % of its GDP , which is important both at home and globally , because it drives the country &apos;s current-account surplus . 
A country that saves more than it invests in equipment and structures ( as China does ) has the extra output to send abroad as a current-account surplus , while a country that invests more than it saves ( as the United States does ) must fill the gap by importing more from the rest of the world than it exports . 
And a country with a current-account surplus has the funds to lend and invest in the rest of the world , while a country with a current-account deficit must finance its external gap by borrowing from the rest of the world . 
More precisely , a country &apos;s current-account balance is exactly equal to the difference between its national saving and its investment . 
The future reduction in China &apos;s saving will therefore mean a reduction in China &apos;s current-account surplus - and thus in its ability to lend to the US and other countries . 
If the new emphasis on increased consumption shrank China &apos;s saving rate by 5 % of its GDP , it would still have the world &apos;s highest saving rate . 
That may not happen , but it certainly could happen by the end of the five-year plan . 
If it does , the impact on the global capital market would be enormous . 
With no current-account surplus , China would no longer be a net purchaser of US government bonds and other foreign securities . 
Moreover , if the Chinese government and Chinese firms want to continue investing in overseas oil resources and in foreign businesses , China will have to sell dollar bonds or other sovereign debt from its portfolio . 
The net result would be higher interest rates on US and other bonds around the world . 
Whether interest rates do rise will also depend on how US saving and investment evolves over the same period . 
America &apos;s household saving rate has risen since 2007 by about 3 % of GDP . 
Corporate saving is also up . 
Indeed , the only reason that America &apos;s current-account deficit was lower in 2010 than in previous years is that investment in housing and other construction declined sharply . 
If Americans &quot; demand for housing picks up and businesses want to increase their investment , a clash between China &apos;s lower saving rate and a continued high fiscal deficit in the US could drive up global interest rates significantly .
