South Asia &apos;s Whispering Enemies 
ISLAMABAD - The leaders of the member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation met last week in the Maldives for their 17th annual summit . 
Previous SAARC summits achieved little in the way of regional cooperation . 
If they are remembered at all , it is for the progress made in getting India and Pakistan to talk to each another . 
While this time was no different , there are growing signs of a thaw in relations . 
Improvement in the India-Pakistan relationship - the main obstacle to greater economic cooperation in South Asia - has come whenever the two countries &quot; governments have agreed to work together to achieve a common good . 
That happened in 2004 , when , after agreeing to initiate what they called a &quot; composite dialogue &quot; that would cover eight issues that had kept them apart for decades , India and Pakistan also agreed to work towards the creation of the South Asia Free Trade Area ( SAFTA ) . 
Without such limited agreements , stasis in South Asia is the rule . 
SAFTA was launched in July 2006 , but it did little to increase trade between India and Pakistan , which has barely developed since 1947 , when the two countries fought the first of many trade - as well as real - wars against each other . 
In November 2008 , after a group of terrorists attacked Mumbai , India &apos;s financial center , India accused Pakistan of involvement in the attack and suspended all dealings with its neighbor . 
The composite dialogue was put on hold , with both sides unable to cast off the heavy burden of decades of hostility and intense rivalry . 
Nevertheless , bilateral relations have warmed slightly over the past 18 months . 
The process began at a meeting in Bhutan between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India and Yousaf Raza Gilani , his Pakistani counterpart . 
India agreed to begin talking again with its neighbor , accepting Pakistan &apos;s argument that it , too , was a victim of terrorism . 
Since that meeting , the two countries &quot; prime ministers have met four times , always on the sidelines of international gatherings . 
Their foreign ministers have met three times , and their commerce ministers once . 
The Indians agreed to resume the suspended dialogue with Pakistan , despite the failure fully to resolve the Mumbai attacks legally , as well as Pakistan &apos;s inability or unwillingness to move against the two domestically-based terrorist groups that India had accused of having masterminded those and several other attacks on its territory . 
The most important outcome of these renewed contacts was the Pakistani cabinet &apos;s decision , on November 2 , to grant India most-favored-nation ( MFN ) status in trade relations . 
Under the rules of the World Trade Organization , MFN status should have been given after both countries became members . 
India granted Pakistan MFN status in 1996 , but Pakistan held back , hoping to win concessions from India on the unresolved issue of Kashmir . 
That , of course , did not happen , and Pakistan has at last changed its mind . 
What that implies is that trade with India will be conducted according to the same set of regulations and tariffs that govern other countries &quot; trade with Pakistan . 
India responded to Pakistan &apos;s gesture by supporting its bid for membership of the United Nation &apos;s Security Council , and by withdrawing its objections to the European Union &apos;s grant of special privileges to Pakistani textile exporters . 
So the Maldives SAARC meeting offered an opportunity for further easing of tensions . 
The summit started with a one-on-one meeting between the two countries &quot; prime ministers . 
After an hour together , they emerged to tell the press that no new steps aimed at improving relations had been agreed upon . 
Gilani did , however , say that they had &quot; discussed all core issues , including Kashmir , &quot; and that they &quot; hope the next round will be more constructive , more positive , and will open up a new chapter in the history of both countries . &quot; 
Given that Pakistan &apos;s relations with the United States are arguably at an all-time low , Pakistani leaders seem determined to lower the temperature on its disputes with other global powers , particularly India . 
Gilani extended another invitation to Singh to visit Pakistan . 
Singh , in keeping with past practice ( he has received at least six invitations from various Pakistani leaders , starting with then-President Pervez Musharraf ) , remained non-committal , but showed warmth towards his Pakistani counterpart . 
&quot; I always regard Gilani as a man of peace , and every time I meet him my belief is further strengthened , &quot; he told the press . 
More was expected from the SAARC summit than was achieved , owing in large part to the unmet expectations for the meeting between the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers on the sidelines of the main event . 
The &quot; Addu Declaration , &quot; issued after the conclusion of the meeting , promised small moves by the eight SAARC member states , rather than a breakthrough on matters such as the settlement of trade disputes , granting of transit rights , and encouragement of cross-border investments . 
Enduring hostility between India and Pakistan , the region &apos;s largest economies , remains the key barrier to such a breakthrough . 
Neither Gilani nor Singh was certain of domestic public support for further warming of relations , so they played it safe , rather than displaying the bold leadership that the occasion demanded .
