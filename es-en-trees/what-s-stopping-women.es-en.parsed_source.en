What &apos;s Stopping Women ? 
PRINCETON - When I wrote the cover article of the July / August issue of The Atlantic , entitled &quot; Why Women Still Can &apos;t Have It All , &quot; I expected a hostile reaction from many American career women of my generation and older , and positive reactions from women aged roughly 25-35 . 
I expected that many men of that younger generation would also have strong reactions , given how many of them are trying to figure out how to be with their children , support their wives &quot; careers , and pursue their own plans . 
I also expected to hear from business representatives about whether my proposed solutions - greater workplace flexibility , ending the culture of face-time and &quot; time machismo , &quot; and allowing parents who have been out of the workforce or working part-time to compete equally for top jobs once they re-enter - were feasible or utopian . 
What I did not expect was the speed and scale of the reaction - almost a million readers within a week and far too many written responses and TV , radio , and blog debates for me to follow - and its global scope . 
I have conducted interviews with journalists in Britain , Germany , Norway , India , Australia , Japan , the Netherlands , and Brazil ; and articles about the piece have been published in France , Ireland , Italy , Bolivia , Jamaica , Vietnam , Israel , Lebanon , Canada , and many other countries . 
Reactions differ across countries , of course . 
Indeed , in many ways , the article is a litmus test of where individual countries are in their own evolution toward full equality for men and women . 
India and Britain , for example , have had strong women prime ministers in Indira Gandhi and Margaret Thatcher , but now must grapple with the &quot; woman-as-man &quot; archetype of female success . 
The Scandinavian countries know that women around the world look to them as pioneers of social and economic policies that enable women to be mothers and successful career professionals , and that encourage and expect men to play an equal parenting role . 
But they are not producing as many women managers in the private sector as the United States is , much less at the top ranks . 
The Germans are deeply conflicted . 
One major German magazine decided to frame my contribution to the debate as &quot; career woman admits that it &apos;s better to be home . &quot; 
Another ( more accurately ) highlighted my emphasis on the need for deep social and economic change to allow women to have equal choices . 
The French remain studiously aloof , even a little disdainful , as befits a nation that rejects &quot; feminism &quot; as an anti-feminine American creation and manages to produce a leader who is simultaneously as accomplished and as elegant as Christine Lagarde , the head of the International Monetary Fund . 
Of course , the example of her predecessor , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , and other stories about French male behavior that would count as clear sexual harassment in the stodgy US , suggest that perhaps a bit more feminisme a la Fran√ßaise is in order . 
Beyond Europe , Japanese women lament how far they must still go in a relentlessly male and sexist culture . 
The Chinese now have a generation of educated , empowered young women who are not sure whether they want to marry at all , owing to the constraints that a husband ( and a mother-in-law ) would place on their freedom . 
Brazilian women point with pride to their president , Dilma Rousseff , but also underscore how much discrimination remains . 
In Australia , with its robust work-life debate , women point to the success of Julia Gillard , the first woman prime minister , but note that she has no children ( nor does German Chancellor Angela Merkel , the first woman to lead her country ) . 
The global nature of this debate demonstrates at least three important lessons . 
First , if &quot; soft power &quot; means exercising influence because &quot; others want what you want , &quot; as Joseph Nye puts it , then women the world over want what American feminists began fighting for three generations ago . 
Second , Americans , not surprisingly , have much to learn from other countries &quot; debates , laws , and cultural norms . 
After all , women have ascended the political ladder faster in many other countries than they have in the US . 
Finally , these are not &quot; women &apos;s issues , &quot; but social and economic issues . 
Societies that discover how to use the education and talent of half their populations , while allowing women and their partners to invest in their families , will have a competitive edge in the global knowledge / innovation economy . 
Of course , hundreds of millions of women around the world can only wish that they had the problems about which I wrote . 
Last week brought news of yet another murder of a women &apos;s rights activist in Pakistan ; evidence that the Egyptian military may be deliberately using sexual assault to deter women from demonstrating in Cairo &apos;s Tahrir Square ; a horrific report from the New York-based Women &apos;s Media Center about Syrian government forces &quot; use of sexual violence and gang rape ; and a video of a Taliban commander brutally executing a woman for adultery as his fellow soldiers and villagers cheered . 
Those are just the most extreme cases of physical violence that many women face . 
Worldwide , more than a billion women confront grinding and overt gender discrimination in education , nutrition , health care , and salaries . 
Women &apos;s rights are a global issue of the highest importance , and it is necessary to focus on the worst violations . 
Still , consider a recent matter-of-fact report from a sober and respected US magazine . 
In an article on &quot; Women in Washington , &quot; the National Journal observed that women in the US capital have come a long way , but &quot; still face career barriers , and often the biggest one is having a family . &quot; 
If &quot; having a family &quot; is still a career barrier for women , but not for men , that , too , is a matter of women &apos;s rights ( and thus of human rights ) . 
In the global debate about work , family , and the promise of gender equality , no society is exempt .
