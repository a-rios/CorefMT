The Naked ECB 
LONDON - The crisis in the eurozone remains far from resolution . 
Investor worries are now concentrated on the health of European banks , many of which have large exposures to Greece and the other southern European countries with severe fiscal problems . 
Europe &apos;s leaders have so far applied only plaster to the wounds . 
A stabilization fund has been established , but on a temporary basis . 
New arrangements for monitoring member states &quot; budget balances have been introduced , but they can do nothing about the stock of debt outstanding . 
And the European Central Bank has begun to buy government bonds , including those of Greece , at prices well above those that would prevail in a free market . 
The latter move by the ECB has underscored a number of unresolved questions about the structure of the Bank and how it makes its decisions . 
Some issues that Europe &apos;s decision-makers have wanted to keep under the carpet have now been rudely exposed . 
The decision to buy Greek bonds directly was not unanimous . 
The world now knows that Axel Weber , the president of the Bundesbank , voted against it . 
His was one vote out of 22 , but he represents 27 % of eurozone GDP , so he cannot be dismissed as an insignificant outlier . 
It was the first time that the president of the ECB has had to reveal that a decision was not unanimous . 
In theory , we have always known that the ECB would , if necessary , make decisions on the basis of majority rule . 
But , until now , no such case had arisen , and there were no procedures for disclosing votes . 
This stands in marked contrast to the United States Federal Reserve , and also the Bank of England , where individual votes on the Monetary Policy Committee are routinely revealed . 
The argument against transparency has been that , in the unusual circumstances of the ECB , to expose the votes of individual members of the Governing Council would put pressure on them as representatives of member states . 
The governor from a country in recession might feel almost bound to vote against an increase in interest rates , or for a cut , regardless of overall conditions in the eurozone . 
But can an absence of clarity about the ECB &apos;s voting arrangements last forever ? 
Nout Wellink of the Dutch Central Bank has explicitly said that more disclosure would one day be needed as the ECB reaches maturity . 
Weber &apos;s dissenting voice on Greek bond purchases brings that day dramatically closer . 
It also exposes a more fundamental problem . 
The voting structure in the ECB is flawed . 
In any federal system , a balance must be struck between those who are charged with assessing economic conditions in the whole monetary area and those who represent the interests of particular regions . 
This problem has been addressed before , in both the Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank . 
In the case of the Fed , seven members of the Board in Washington have a federal remit , and twelve presidents of regional reserve banks vote in rotation , with only the New York president having a permanent voice . 
So the ratio of central to regional votes is 1 : 0.7 . 
The Bundesbank had a similar arrangement with a central / regional balance of 1 : 1.1 . 
The ECB is different , for some good reasons . 
It is the monetary authority of a federation of sovereign states . 
The weight of individual national members of the Governing Council is much greater . 
In fact , the ratio of federal to national votes in the ECB is 1 : 2.5 . 
And , since each member state has one vote , there is a massive imbalance between the voting weight and the GDP weight of individual countries . 
Germany has the same weight as Malta . 
The ECB has thought about this problem , but all that has been agreed ( in the Nice Treaty ) is some modest rotation of voting membership as the federation grows further . 
This will not correct the imbalances that exist today . 
So far , this problem has attracted little attention . 
But Weber &apos;s dissent opens up the possibility that small countries could vote down the center and the large members . 
It is theoretically possible that the six Executive Board members plus France , Germany , and Italy , representing 65 % percent of the eurozone &apos;s GDP , could be outvoted by a coalition of small countries . 
That could matter a lot in relation to interest-rate decisions . 
It could also be relevant to purchases of debt from distressed member states . 
It is highly likely that the Greek debt that the ECB has acquired is not worth what it has paid . 
If Greece were forced to restructure its debt and impose a &quot; haircut &quot; on holders of its bonds , the ECB would incur a sizeable loss . 
That loss would be borne by eurozone member states in proportion to their share of eurozone GDP , even though the votes are one per country . 
This peculiar arrangement is a further major risk for economic and monetary union , to add to those of uncoordinated fiscal policies and the lack of a European equivalent of the International Monetary Fund . 
Especially in nervous markets , which we certainly have today , any perception that the ECB &apos;s decisions might not take into account the interests of the whole eurozone , or could commit the major countries to significant losses , could itself be destabilizing . 
This points to a clear need to revisit the terms of the Nice Treaty . 
But it is increasingly clear that the eurozone needs a major overhaul if it is to survive . 
And the ECB &apos;s voting arrangements are one further element in need of reform .
