The Kingpins &quot; Mexico 
MEXICO CITY - The capture of Joaquín &quot; El Chapo &quot; Guzmán - one of the world &apos;s most wanted criminals - is just one victory in the long fight against Mexico &apos;s narcotics traffickers . 
Much more is needed to change the vicious cycle of violence and corruption that undermines the rule of law in Mexico . 
President Enrique Peña Nieto will benefit from his arrest and probable extradition to the United States . 
After all , a majority of Mexicans appear to be disenchanted with his presidency . 
According to Reforma , the country &apos;s most influential newspaper , Peña Nieto &apos;s approval ratings among the country &apos;s elite plummeted during his first year in office , from 67 % to 40 % ( and fell from 63 % to 55 % among the general public ) . 
But Chapo &apos;s arrest will help Peña Nieto only so much . 
In just 14 months , he has been able to forge a consensus to enact urgently needed but controversial reforms , overhauling the education system , for example , and opening the energy sector to foreign investment . 
At the same time , he is sabotaging his own agenda , owing to a contradictory governing style that is limiting his effectiveness . 
To be sure , a team of professionals leads Peña Nieto &apos;s security cabinet ; but other parts of this government are affected by the habits he acquired as Governor of the State of Mexico , the most populous of Mexico &apos;s 31 states , which surrounds Mexico City . 
He has appointed inept officials to reward political loyalty , has made no commitment to transparency , and has failed to combat the corruption that is devastating the country . 
Michoacán - a southwestern Mexican state - is an extreme and revealing example of this . 
In a region of the state called Tierra Caliente ( Hot Land ) , war is being waged by three armed groups : the government ( army , navy , and federal police ) and their allies , the self-defense groups , and organized crime militias that call themselves the Knights Templar . 
The Knights Templar had taken over the state by making the most of its leaders &quot; complicity , corruption , and ineptitude . 
They would have continued extorting money from the population were it not for the appearance , in February 2013 , of the self-defense groups , which now have the approval of a majority of the Mexican people . 
For the time being , the alliance of federal forces and self-defense groups has the Knights Templar on the defensive . 
And if this continues , the cartel &apos;s fragmentation may be inevitable . 
But its disappearance or disgregation would not mean the end of the drug trafficking ; indeed , the real problem is that Peña Nieto &apos;s government is not attacking the deep roots of Mexico &apos;s violence . 
Consider , for example , the &quot; Templarian Princess &quot; Melissa Plancarte , the daughter of a notorious Michoacán narcotics capo who sings &quot; narco-corridos &quot; praising her father &apos;s cartel . 
She recorded part of a music video in the Michoacán Palace of Justice . 
Peña Nieto &apos;s government has preferred to ignore this and other signs of the power of organized crime and the subjugation of the local authorities , because Michoacán is governed by his Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) . 
It is the same in Veracruz , Tamaulipas , and other states . 
The Mexican political class simply refuses to combat corruption and impunity . 
Mexican governance is undermined not only by narco-traffickers ( who have gained a stranglehold on some Mexican states ) , but by industrial and business cartels , as well as other entrenched interests which have impeded implementation of reforms even after they become law . 
The state in Mexico is ineffective , and democracy has weak foundations . 
Violence is nurtured and sustained by an economic model that encourages illegality and inequality . 
According to official data , 60 % of the working population is employed in the informal sector , while youth unemployment is exceptionally high . 
Organized crime depends on an abundant supply of young people who are willing to risk their lives in the hope of quick economic gain . 
So the questions for Mexico are these : Will Peña Nieto go to the root causes of violence , even if they undermine his own political base ? 
Will the current economic reforms reduce inequality , or will the prosperity of some continue to be built on the misery of others ? 
Although it is impossible to anticipate how Mexico &apos;s many contemporary crises will end , we do know that in the coming years Mexico will continue to be characterized by a combination of solid macroeconomic numbers , chronic inequality , and structural violence . 
In this context , El Chapo &apos;s capture is just a footnote in a much more complicated story .
