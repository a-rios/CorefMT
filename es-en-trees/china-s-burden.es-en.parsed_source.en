China &apos;s Burden 
CHENGDU - Last month saw the 50th anniversary of what Tibetan activists like to call Tibetan National Uprising Day , the day in 1959 when Tibetans in Lhasa revolted against Chinese Communist Party rule . 
The rebellion was crushed . 
The Dalai Lama fled to India , and for at least a decade things became a lot worse : many Tibetans - possibly more than a million - starved to death during Chairman Mao &apos;s Great Leap Forward campaign , temples and monasteries were smashed , sometimes by Tibetan Red Guards , during the Cultural Revolution , and a large number of people died in the violence . 
Chinese officials are noticeably jumpy in this year of anniversaries ( 20 years after Tiananmen ) . 
This March , I was in Chengdu , in Sichuan province , where many Tibetans live . 
Even foreign tourists who had no clue about the anniversary were stopped in the streets by policemen looking for signs of rebellion . 
Not only was it forbidden to take pictures there ; one couldn &apos;t even walk through . 
The Chinese press , however , marked the anniversary with effusive articles describing Tibetan joy at being liberated from centuries of feudalism and slavery . 
If the China Daily , among other publications , is to be believed , &quot; pre-Liberation &quot; Tibet was a living hell , and Tibetans are now happy and grateful to be citizens of the People &apos;s Republic of China . 
Some probably are . 
Many are not . 
But if Chinese propaganda paints too dark a picture of the Tibetan past , Westerners who sympathize with the Tibetan cause are often too sentimental . 
The personal charm of the Dalai Lama , combined with the Himalayan air of superior spiritual wisdom , has promoted a caricature of a mystical , wise , and peace-loving people being crushed by a brutal empire . 
It was not for nothing , however , that quite a few educated Tibetans actually welcomed the Chinese Communists in 1950 . 
The Buddhist clergy was seen , not without reason , as hidebound and oppressive . 
Chinese Communism promised modernization . 
And that is what China &apos;s government delivered in the last few decades . 
Lhasa , a sleepy , rather grubby backwater only 30 years ago , is now a city of huge public squares , shopping centers , and high-rise buildings , connected to the rest of China with a high-speed railway line . 
It is true that Tibetans , sparsely represented in local government , may not have benefited as much as the Han Chinese , whose presence in cities , such as Lhasa , as soldiers , traders , and prostitutes is so overwhelming that people worry about the extinction of Tibetan culture , except as an official tourist attraction . 
Still , there is no question that Tibetan towns are now more modern - in terms of electrification , education , hospitals , and other public facilities - than they were before . 
This is one of the arguments used not only by Chinese officials , but by almost all Chinese , to justify Tibet &apos;s absorption into greater China . 
This argument has a long history . 
Western ( and , indeed , Japanese ) imperialists used it in the early twentieth century to justify their &quot; missions &quot; to &quot; civilize &quot; or &quot; modernize &quot; the natives . 
Taiwan , under Japanese rule , was in fact more modern than other parts of China . 
And the British brought modern administration , as well as railways , universities , and hospitals , to India . 
Outside a fringe of nostalgic chauvinists , however , most Europeans and Japanese are no longer so convinced that modernization is sufficient validation of imperial rule . 
Modernization should be carried out by self-governing people , not imposed by foreign force . 
Tibetans , in other words , should be allowed to modernize themselves . 
But the Chinese have another argument up their sleeve , which seems more plausible ( and more modern ) . 
They are justly proud of the ethnic diversity of China . 
Why should nationality be defined by language or ethnicity ? 
If Tibetans should be allowed to break away from China , why not the Welsh from Britain , the Basques from Spain , the Kurds from Turkey , or the Kashmiris from India ? 
In some cases , the answer might be : well , perhaps they should . 
But ethnicity as the main marker of nationality is a vague and dangerous concept , not least because it leaves all minorities out in the cold . 
So are people wrong to support the Tibetan cause ? 
Should we dismiss it as sentimental nonsense ? 
Not necessarily . 
The issue is not so much Tibetan culture , or spirituality , or even national independence , but political consent . 
In this respect , the Tibetans are no worse off than other citizens of the People &apos;s Republic of China . 
Historic monuments are being bulldozed everywhere in China in the name of development . 
Culture is being sterilized , homogenized , and deprived of independence and spontaneity in all Chinese cities , not just in Tibet . 
No Chinese citizen , regardless of whether he or she is Han , Tibetan , Uighur , or Mongolian , can vote the ruling party out of power . 
The problem , then , is not mainly one of nationality or discrimination , but of politics . 
The Chinese government claims that Tibetans are happy . 
But , without a free press , and the right to vote , there is no way of knowing this . 
Sporadic acts of collective violence , followed by equally violent oppression , suggest that many are not . 
Without democratic reform there will be no end to this cycle , for violence is the typical expression of people without free speech . 
This is true not only for Tibet , but also for the rest of China . 
Tibetans will be free only when all Chinese are free . 
In that sense , if in no other , all citizens of China hang together .
