The Messages of May 25 
KYIV - Europe recently experienced two watershed elections , with very different outcomes . 
Whereas Ukraine &apos;s presidential election has been widely hailed as the end of the beginning of Ukraine &apos;s political transition , the European Parliament election has been lamented as the beginning of the end of the idea of an ever-closer union . 
The polls , both held on May 25 , not only provide insight into the mindset of the respective electorates ; the behavior of each electorate also offers important lessons for the other . 
Ukraine &apos;s election was shaped by an acute awareness of the risks facing the country . 
Following the &quot; Euromaidan &quot; revolution - which brought about the demise of President Viktor Yanukovych &apos;s government - and a four-month interim administration , this election centered on change . 
This is not as surprising as it might seem . 
Ukrainians were making a sober decision , voting with their heads , not their hearts . 
Indeed , polls indicate that Poroshenko &apos;s appeal lay largely in his focus on immediate internal challenges . 
By contrast , his rivals , most notably Yulia Tymoshenko , emphasized a rapid shift toward NATO and the European Union . 
Ukrainians also eschewed the temptations of populism and extreme nationalism . 
The poor performance of the right-wing Svoboda and Right Sector candidates - which together won less than 2 % of the vote - should finally quash Russian assertions of a fascistic regime in Kyiv . 
Ukrainians hope that Poroshenko , with his moderate approach and willingness to negotiate , will be better equipped to resolve the country &apos;s perilous security situation than his more ardent rivals . 
While Russian President Vladimir Putin has recently toned down his rhetoric , violence persists - a clear indication of the challenge that lies ahead . 
Indeed , Ukraine remains on the verge of becoming a failed state . 
Security may be the most pressing issue , but it is certainly not the only one . 
Poroshenko &apos;s government must also reinvigorate and strengthen Ukraine &apos;s economy . 
Doing so requires , first and foremost , measures to halt the decline in foreign direct investment , which fell by 30 % from 2012 to 2013 . 
Improved governance is also critical - no small challenge for a country that ranks 144th on Transparency International &apos;s Corruption Perceptions Index , alongside Iran and Nigeria . 
Ukraine &apos;s election became a focal point for reconstruction . 
The outcome was driven by voters &quot; recognition of their country &apos;s fundamental problems - starkly apparent in the tents that remain on Maidan Square , the loss of Crimea , and the separatist violence in Donbas - and their desire for an effective government to address those problems . 
The next step in this process - a parliamentary election - should occur as soon as possible . 
The European Parliament election , by contrast , was an exercise in disruption . 
Support for far-right and far-left parties was based on citizens &quot; frustrations with Europe &apos;s flaws , rather than on any realistic , thoughtful agenda . 
Populists and Euroskeptics fed on the discontent of those who have felt neglected by EU institutions , and now believe that the benefits of the European project , such as freedom of movement , no longer outweigh the burdens , like immigration and austerity . 
There is growing reticence among Europeans about further integration , owing largely to fears that ever-closer union will diminish national identity . 
Of course , the notion of returning to the pre-EU world is fundamentally flawed , owing to the simple fact that individual European countries cannot compete in the modern global economy . 
Nonetheless , a sense of nostalgia drove many voters &quot; decisions . 
Simply put , Europeans voted from the heart . 
What Europe needs is serious debate , not emotional reactions . 
The problem is that the European Commission and the European Parliament have consistently failed to generate a compelling narrative , leaving ordinary Europeans unconvinced of the EU &apos;s value . 
Making matters worse , national and European leaders have allowed - even encouraged - citizens to believe that integration is inevitable , lowering the stakes for European elections . 
This is where the Ukrainian election can offer a critical lesson to the EU , despite the vast differences between the challenges that they face . 
The European project is a complicated and ambitious endeavor , the viability of which depends on constant care and adjustment . 
Unless Europeans recognize that the Union is not a given , and acknowledge the value of the prosperity and security that it provides , the recent election may come to be seen not as a wake-up call , but as a swan song for the integration project . 
The European election &apos;s outcome also has a powerful message for Ukraine : there are limits to its European prospects . 
To be sure , Ukraine has a strong partner in the EU - particularly if its government responds effectively to voters &quot; call for improved governance . 
But , whatever Ukraine achieves , it cannot overcome Europeans &quot; fears of further integration , much less enlargement . 
That is up to Europe . 
In the immediate future , Ukraine and the European Union must focus on building a functioning relationship . 
For Ukraine to push for more , such as by requesting membership in the EU , would be a tactical mistake . 
In this sense , the lesson of the May 25 elections is the same for both Ukraine and the EU : it is time for each to put its own house in order .
