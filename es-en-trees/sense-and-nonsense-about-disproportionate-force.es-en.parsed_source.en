Sense and Nonsense about Disproportionate Force 
As the war in Lebanon continues , the term &quot; disproportionate force &quot; is being bandied about as if some crystal clear principle of international law lay behind it , telling us when force is disproportionate and why it is illegal . 
But civilian deaths as a result of military combat are not enough to say that &quot; disproportionate force &quot; has been used . 
Nor has that standard , whatever it is , been met if more children die on one side than the other . 
So what , then , does &quot; disproportionate force &quot; mean , and what is its place in the law of war ? 
Let &apos;s go back to basics . 
In the domestic law of self ‑ defense , the use of force must always be both necessary and proportionate to the interest being protected . 
A good example is whether a storeowner may shoot looters who are escaping with his goods . 
If there is no other way to stop the thieves , the use of force is necessary . 
But is it proportional ? 
That depends on whether the cost to the looters of being shot so clearly outweighs the value of the stolen goods that the storeowner should do nothing , at least at the moment . 
He always has recourse to the police and the possibility that they might recover the goods . 
In other words , force becomes disproportionate when the costs of using it are too high . 
However , this does not mean that force becomes &quot; disproportionate &quot; simply when the costs outweigh the benefits . 
After all , a woman may use deadly force to avoid being raped , even though the life of the aggressor , one would think , is worth more than the sexual integrity of the potential victim . 
Anytime physical harm is threatened , it seems that the use of all necessary force is permissible . 
Suppose a terrorist is pulling out his victim &apos;s teeth one by one , and that the only way to stop him is to kill him . 
Most people would say that doing so is permissible , even though the harm to the aggressor is much greater than the value of the victim &apos;s teeth . 
How , then , do we know when force is disproportionate ? 
This is a matter of constant debate . 
Many legal systems now take the position that , with regard to property offenses at least , the victim must be willing to surrender his property when the only available option is to kill the thief . 
Let us try to apply these principles to international conflict . 
Two distinct realms of self ‑ defense exist within the law of war . 
One is the justification for going to war in the first place ; the second is the use of force in combat in the course of war , such as killing civilians who are attacking soldiers . 
In the justification of armed conflict , everyone agrees that the defending state may use all necessary force to repel an aggressor . 
When Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands , the United Kingdom could take whatever measures were necessary to remove them . 
But let us suppose that the British bombed Buenos Aires . 
For the use of force to be necessary , it must yield a direct military advantage that contributes to thwarting the aggression . 
It would not be acceptable to argue that to bomb a city on the mainland was necessary in order to compel the Argentine population to put pressure on the military junta to withdraw from the islands . 
So bombing Buenos Aires in that context would have been unnecessary and therefore could not possibly qualify as proportionate . 
International lawyers commonly confuse the concepts of necessity and proportionality , claiming that both apply in wars of self ‑ defense . 
But this is not as clear as it is in domestic criminal law . 
I know of no case in the international version of shooting escaping looters where a court has affirmed that the use of force was necessary but not proportionate . 
There are two reasons why international law is tolerant of the use of all , or nearly all , necessary force . 
First , in international conflicts , the defending army must always protect the lives of its citizens , not just property interests . 
Second , with rare exceptions , there is no international police force that can assist a defending nation . 
The problem of disproportionate force has different contours on the battlefield , when soldiers are already at war . 
Among all the dozens of war crimes in international law , none mentions the element of disproportionate force . 
The closest adjective used in the Rome Statute is &quot; clearly excessive &quot; force . 
Intentional targeting of civilians is prohibited , as is an attack on military targets in the knowledge that there will be &quot; clearly excessive &quot; harm relative to the value of the military target . 
As one would expect , there is no criterion , not even a theory , for determining when the use of force carries an excessive cost to civilian bystanders . 
The specific problem in Lebanon , particularly Israel &apos;s bombing of southern Beirut , is deciding when the targets are protected civilians or part of a militant terrorist organization and thus subject to legitimate attack . 
We have too little information about many of these attacks to know one way or the other . 
This is an area where the concepts are clear but the facts remain murky . 
Journalists on the ground would do well to inquire about the relevant military objectives rather than pass judgment on the basis of the numbers of civilians killed , which may have minimal relevance to legal analysis .
