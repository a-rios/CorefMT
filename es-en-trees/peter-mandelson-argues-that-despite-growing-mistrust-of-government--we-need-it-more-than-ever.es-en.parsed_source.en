The Case for Better Government 
LONDON - A recent survey by the World Economic Forum &apos;s Network of Global Agenda Councils rated government lower than either business or media in its ability to respond to global challenges . 
On one level , this is understandable , given the plethora of challenges that governments face and the lack of long-term solutions to many problems that demand one . 
But , on another level , the attempt to rate government alongside business and the media is fundamentally misguided : no sector operates at the scale of responsibility , accountability , and expectation that governments do . 
Business decides for itself where to invest and grow . 
Government enjoys neither luxury . 
It cannot simply pack up and move on when it faces a loss or is bored with a story . 
Government must stay put - and must often clean up the messes left behind by those who do not . 
On a good day , it may even get to make improvements . 
The problem for governments , more often than not , is that in attempting to respond to and reconcile often conflicting individual , family , and national needs , their ability to deliver results efficiently and effectively has declined . 
As a result , trust in government has plummeted . 
Most of the people with whom I spoke complained endlessly about government shortcomings . 
It is easy for business to want government just to get out of the way , and for the media to point fingers and sensationalize events without much depth of analysis - or even , sometimes , grasp of reality . 
True , India may not be the best advertisement for democracy in some respects , given how hard it often seems there to make long-term decisions and implement them without being buffeted - and frequently derailed - by volatile public opinion and hard-nosed vested interests . 
But the alternative - rule not by law but by dictatorship - is a far nastier prospect . 
And there are not many problems in India &apos;s governance that state funding of politics could not solve . 
After all , when serving a vast democracy requires non-stop electioneering , and politicians are thus dependent on financial donations , governance is bound to go awry . 
Governments &quot; ability to respond to global challenges is a more general problem . 
Globalization - the breaking down of national boundaries and the integration of economies across continents - has resulted in burgeoning demands on governments at the same time that their ability to provide answers has been reduced . 
In other words , demand for government is exceeding supply . 
Globalization has made many people feel more insecure and in need of government support to cope with the pressures on their livelihoods and quality of life . 
But most of the policy responses needed to meet people &apos;s demand for greater security are beyond the scope and reach of national governments , especially when these governments are trying to cope on their own . 
That is why , long ago , European countries saw the sense in pooling their weight and reach through the European Union . 
Imperfect as the EU is , it still represents the best response to globalization yet seen among any extended group of countries . 
Governments working together are better than governments working separately - or , worse , against one another . 
We live in an increasingly multipolar world , in which major emerging economies and their populous societies are transforming the international landscape . 
But , at the same time , multilateral frameworks are in decline , undermining the ability to bring sense and coherence to this world . 
Consider the international trading system and its centerpiece , the World Trade Organization . 
Since the demise of the Doha Round , the WTO &apos;s standing as a multilateral negotiating forum has declined sharply , salvaged in part by the recent agreement in Bali . 
It will be essential , after Bali , to reflect seriously on the next phase for the WTO and its role in the international trading system . 
Until we reverse the trend of declining multilateralism , governments &quot; ability to respond to global challenges will not improve . 
Business can moan and the media can carp , but the answer to many of the world &apos;s great problems is more - or at least better - government , not less . 
A better supply of government meeting the flow of demands . 
Ronald Reagan famously insisted that , &quot; government is not the solution to our problem ; government is the problem . &quot; 
Today we know better : If government is not part of the solution , our problems will only get bigger .
