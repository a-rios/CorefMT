Is Blasphemy Hate Speech ? 
NEW YORK - The assassination of Salman Taseer , the governor of Punjab province in Pakistan and an outspoken critic of religious extremism , has focused attention on his country &apos;s draconian blasphemy law . 
Adopted in its present form by General Mohammad Zia ul-Haq &apos;s military dictatorship more than three decades ago , the blasphemy law imposes a mandatory death penalty on anyone convicted of insulting Islam . 
The police officer who murdered Taseer apparently acted because the governor recently launched a campaign to repeal the law . 
From the standpoint of Pakistani religious extremists who have applauded the murder , that itself was an act of blasphemy . 
For a long time , blasphemy laws were considered an unfortunate legacy of efforts in England during the religious struggles of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to suppress deviant interpretations of scripture among Christians . 
They were spread in South Asian countries and elsewhere through British colonial rule . 
General Zia &apos;s harsh version of the law in Pakistan was adopted as part of his effort to use Islam to legitimize his suppression of all dissent . 
Blasphemy became a global concern in the late 1980 &quot; s when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa calling for the assassination of the writer Salman Rushdie for his novel , The Satanic Verses . 
Although Rushdie survived with the help of an extraordinary level of protection provided by British security forces , others associated with his book were murdered . 
More recently , arguments that it is legitimate to make blasphemy a crime have , disturbingly , gathered increasing support . 
Those who insist that blasphemy does not warrant the protection otherwise given to freedom of expression often claim that it is a form of hate speech . 
It seems important , therefore , to clarify the differences between hate speech and blasphemy . 
Inasmuch as hate speech involves incitement of imminent violence , it may be made criminal , even in the United States , where freedom of expression enjoys particularly strong legal protection . 
It is assumed in such circumstances that the violence will be carried out by those who sympathize with the views of the person inciting hatred . An example would be a mob attack on a member of a racial or religious group in direct response to a speech urging an assault on members of that group . 
Ordinarily , however , the circumstances in which blasphemy may lead to violence are entirely different . 
In those circumstances , the violence is not imminent , and it is carried out by those offended by the speaker &apos;s views rather than by sympathizers . 
And , of course , it is typically carried out directly on the speaker . 
This makes criminalization of blasphemy a far greater threat to freedom of expression . 
After all , while a speaker can reasonably take care not to express views that will lead to imminent violence , if listeners have unlimited discretion in determining what causes offense , the speaker can never know what will so offend some people near or far at some time in the future that they will commit violence . 
These differences between hate speech and blasphemy are fundamental . 
It is , therefore , inappropriate to extend the legal restrictions on hate speech to blasphemy . 
Criminalizing blasphemy should be strongly opposed as an unwarranted restriction on freedom of expression , even by those who believe that there are certain limited circumstances in which it is appropriate to make hate speech a crime . 
Of course , such distinctions do not matter much to the religious fanatics who rejoice in the murder of Salman Taseer . 
Yet those who admire his courage in struggling for freedom of expression ought to see to it that efforts to make blasphemy a crime , or to perpetuate it as a criminal offense , are afforded no legitimacy whatsoever .
