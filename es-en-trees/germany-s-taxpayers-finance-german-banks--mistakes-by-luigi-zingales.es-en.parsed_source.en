German Banks on Top 
CHICAGO - Overcoming the European Union &apos;s current economic malaise , as almost everyone acknowledges , requires deeper integration , with the first step taking the form of a banking union supervised by the European Central Bank . 
But Europe &apos;s banking union also requires uniform rules for winding up insolvent financial institutions - and this has become a sticking point . 
Germany opposes the new bank-resolution mechanism proposed by the European Commission , generating moral and political support at home by portraying its stance as an effort to protect German taxpayers : Why should the German ants pay for the southern European grasshoppers ? 
In fact , Germany &apos;s position is a ploy to hide its anticompetitive behavior , whereby the government subsidizes German banks and industry at the expense of everyone else - including German taxpayers . 
Europe &apos;s common market has been the single greatest success of post-World War II European policy , boosting economic growth and fostering cultural interchange . 
But a common market requires a level playing field , and the European Commission has worked hard to achieve this in many sectors over the years . 
Until now , the main exception was banking . 
The emerging banking union is not only the first step toward a European fiscal union ; it is also the final step toward completing the European common market . 
Without a common resolution mechanism that levels the playing field , the common market will remain unfinished . 
In principle , the EU &apos;s banking rules are common to all member states . 
In practice , their implementation was , until recently , left to national regulators , who applied very different standards . 
Most important , while state subsidies in all other sectors are forbidden , they are commonly accepted in banking - not only explicit subsidies , such as Germany &apos;s bailout of several Landesbanks after the American subprime-mortgage crisis , but implicit subsidies as well . 
Some French banks &quot; traders openly boast of backing by the French government , which will never let its banks fail . 
Unfortunately , this is not just a French or a German problem . 
All market players know that EU governments will not let big banks fail . 
This implicit subsidy not only costs each country &apos;s taxpayers billions of euros ; it also distorts competition , because not all implicit subsidies are created equal . 
Regardless of its fundamentals , a German bank would be considered safer than an Italian one , because the German government &apos;s implicit guarantee is much more valuable than the Italian government &apos;s . 
As a result , German banks have a lower cost of funding and - all else being equal - higher profitability . 
To the extent that some of the lower cost is rebated to their clients , even industrial firms in Germany enjoy a lower cost of capital , giving them an unfair advantage vis-à-vis their European competitors . 
One way to prevent this distortion would be to create a mechanism to bail out all banks with European money . 
But this approach would not only leave German taxpayers on the hook ; it would also create perverse incentives in the entire European banking system , maximizing instability . 
The preferred alternative is to create a common resolution mechanism , which would apply throughout Europe , regardless of a bank &apos;s country of origin . 
Such a mechanism would prevent the need for government intervention . 
The recent proposal by Michel Barnier , the European Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services , is an effort to implement this solution . 
It provides a common resolution mechanism for all banks in Europe , which forces losses to be absorbed by shareholders , bondholders , and large depositors before any government money is committed . 
To provide short-term financing to a bank during any restructuring , the Commission &apos;s plan would create a European Fund , putting all banks on an equal footing . 
The Commission &apos;s proposal is far from perfect . 
After a bank &apos;s shareholders are wiped out and its creditors take an 8 % &quot; haircut , &quot; the European Fund transforms itself into a bailout fund , justifying some of Germany &apos;s fears . 
And there is no explicit prohibition of some form of national government bailout . 
Even so , the proposal is a step in the right direction . 
German criticism should be directed at improving it , not at sandbagging it . 
German taxpayers have paid dearly for German banks &quot; mistakes . 
In 2008 , when the Landesbanks were found to be full of American subprime mortgages , the German government bailed them out with a € 500 billion ( $ 650 billion ) rescue package at its taxpayers &quot; expense . 
In 2010 , when German banks were badly over-exposed - to the tune of $ 704 billion - to Greece , Ireland , Italy , Portugal , and Spain , European taxpayers and the ECB helped them to bring most of that money home . 
The biggest threat to German taxpayers is not southern European profligacy , but their own country &apos;s banks . 
In this sense , the banking union is not a scheme to burden German taxpayers with the losses of failed southern European banks ; rather , it is a mechanism to render all banks ( including German ones ) accountable for their own mistakes , thereby reducing the burden that they impose on domestic taxpayers . 
It is about time that German voters understood that the largest grasshoppers are in the center of their own towns .
