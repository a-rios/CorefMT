Smart Taxation 
ROME - An effective tax policy that ensures adequate domestic revenue is a crucial determinant of a country &apos;s ability to pursue development policies . 
But tax revenues in most developing countries are low , impeding progress toward more balanced , inclusive , and sustainable economic development that can improve public health and raise standards of living . 
Although non-tax revenue may contribute significantly to some countries &quot; total GDP , the average tax / GDP ratios in low-income and lower-middle-income countries are roughly 15 % and 19 % , respectively - significantly lower than the OECD average of more than 35 % . 
To finance development projects , poor and lower-middle-income countries must devise and implement tax strategies to increase domestic revenue . 
This entails abandoning the prevailing dogma that taxes should only be increased when absolutely necessary . 
This stance assumes that lower tax rates raise the tax / GDP ratio by ensuring better compliance with tax laws , and favors indirect taxation ( such as value-added taxes ) in order to broaden the tax base to include those with modest incomes . 
Meanwhile , direct taxation of corporations and individuals has tended to decline - despite the moot claim that lower direct taxation ensures investment and growth . 
As a result , the tax / GDP ratio in most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America has stagnated or even fallen . 
In many developing countries , total tax revenue is derived from three main sources : domestic taxes on goods and services ( sales and excise taxes ) , direct taxes ( primarily on corporations ) , and , most important , taxes on foreign trade ( import duties ) . 
But , as trade liberalization has lowered tariffs and duties , the share of trade taxes has declined , while other sources have not compensated for falling trade revenue . 
By contrast , in high-income countries , income taxes ( primarily on individuals ) comprise the largest proportion of tax revenue ( roughly 36 % ) , while domestic taxes on goods and services and social-security contributions each account for slightly more than one-quarter . 
Moreover , the share of trade taxes is typically low . 
Of course , developing countries should not simply mimic developed economies &quot; tax systems . 
After all , no one-size-fits-all approach exists , even among developing countries . 
And tax policy must evolve with changing economic circumstances . 
Instead , developing-country leaders must draw on the experiences of both developed countries and their peers to design tax policies that meet the basic requirements of operability , buoyancy , and stability . 
This can include broadening the tax base , reducing tax avoidance and evasion , improving tax collection , and developing new , cooperative international taxation strategies . 
In many countries , tax reform has already significantly increased the share of direct taxes in overall revenue . 
Raising tax rates for the wealthiest citizens in developing a more progressive income tax framework would bolster this progress . 
Governments should also work to improve tax compliance and reduce evasion , which requires limiting tax officials &quot; discretionary authority . 
Computerizing tax administration , for example , could help to limit corruption by making it more difficult to tamper with records . 
In order to increase personal-income taxes &quot; share of total revenue , developing countries are already improving their tax administrations in innovative ways , particularly to reach hard-to-tax citizens . 
More can be done : Every individual who owns a house or a vehicle , is a member of a club , holds a credit card , passport , driver &apos;s license , or other identity card , or subscribes to a telephone service can be required to file a tax return . 
Moreover , excise taxes are a convenient source of revenue in developing countries , as they are primarily levied on products such as alcohol , tobacco , gas , vehicles , and spare parts , which involve few producers , large sales volumes , relatively inelastic demand , and easy observability . 
Excise taxes may be levied when goods leave a factory or arrive at a port , simplifying measurement , collection , and monitoring , while ensuring coverage and limiting evasion . 
But , despite their robust base and low administrative costs , excise taxes currently amount to less than 2 % of low-income countries &quot; GDP , compared to roughly 3 % in high-income countries . 
Developing countries must also aim to offset the consequences of globalization . 
For example , capital mobility increases opportunities for tax evasion , given that tax authorities &quot; capacity to monitor their citizens &quot; overseas incomes is limited , and some governments and financial institutions systematically conceal relevant information . 
If dividends , interest , royalties , and management fees are not taxed in the country in which they are paid , they more easily escape notice in the country of residence . 
Indeed , some countries - including the United States - impose no taxes on interest from large bank deposits by non-resident aliens . 
Globalization may also facilitate legal tax avoidance . 
For example , multinational corporations use methods like transfer pricing ( book-keeping of goods , services , and resources transferred between a single company &apos;s branches or subsidiaries ) to minimize tax liability on their profits from international operations . 
Finally , international competition for inward foreign direct investment may lead governments to reduce tax rates and increase concessions for foreign investors . 
With evidence of sudden capital outflows in response to certain tax-policy changes , governments are reluctant to raise income-tax rates - which have fallen sharply since the late 1970 &quot; s - or to tax dividend and interest income , for fear of capital flight . 
But , as direct-tax concessions have little or no effect in diverting international investment , let alone in attracting such flows , they constitute an unnecessary loss of revenue . 
Beggar-thy-neighbor policies will lead to revenue losses for all developing countries , while undermining the possibility of balanced , inclusive , and sustainable development . 
Developing-country finance ministries and tax authorities must cooperate with one another and with their OECD counterparts to close existing loopholes and establish effective tax policies that support their shared interests . 
With rising public debt worldwide placing fiscal constraints ( real and imagined ) on global economic recovery , such cooperation is more urgent than ever .
