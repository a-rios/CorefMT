The Trouble with Treating Trauma 
When disaster strikes , the arrival of &quot; trained counselors &quot; is as much a part of the theater of disaster as the arrival of the emergency services . 
What do these counselors actually do ? 
Usually , they perform some form of what is called &quot; debriefing &quot; or &quot; critical incident stress debriefing . &quot; 
But do these sessions do any good ? 
Debriefing is invariably a short , usually single session , an intervention that is performed with as many of those caught up in a traumatic event as possible . 
It involves linking examination of the traumatic incident with education about the expected emotional responses and assurances that these are normal . 
The hope is to reduce acute emotional distress and prevent the onset of post-trauma psychiatric disorder . 
Many organizations offer debriefing as part of their response to traumatic incidents - such as police officers involved in firearm incidents , or bank staff who witness robberies . 
In some institutions interventions are compulsory - perhaps out of a desire to reduce psychological distress , but also from a belief this will reduce exposure to litigation . 
There are many reasons why belief in the effectiveness of debriefing has become so widespread . 
When facing disasters , all of us feel a need to do something . 
The idea that talking about trauma must be better than &quot; repressing &quot; or &quot; bottling up &quot; accords with a long tradition in psychological treatment - &quot; better out than in . &quot; 
Many people who have been debriefed judge the experience positively . 
But does it work ? 
There is only one way to really know if any intervention does more good than harm , and that is via randomized controlled trials . 
The studies undertaken so far provide no evidence of any benefit through intervention . 
Perhaps the process of debriefing , part of whose purpose is to warn participants of emotional reactions that might be expected to develop over weeks and months , actually increases the occurrence of these symptoms . 
Perhaps for some people not talking is the most appropriate response . 
Indeed , psychological defense mechanisms may exist precisely because it is not always &quot; better out than in . &quot; 
Talking to a stranger , whom one has never met before and will not meet again , may impede the normal processes of recovery that rely on one &apos;s own social networks - family , friends , priest , doctor , who may be better able to place the trauma in context . 
Perhaps debriefing serves merely to professionalize distress - part of the wider process nowadays by which adversity has been professionalized . 
Of course , when a cherished belief is challenged , various counter claims arise - the evidence is for the wrong type of debriefing , the trials were not well done , elements of debriefing could still &quot; work , &quot; the testimonies of those who are certain it helped them cannot be discounted , and so on . 
So we must reassess how we respond to trauma . 
There can be no doubt that those who are attempting to help people involved in disasters and trauma have noble motives , but that is not enough . 
It is time that those who are asked to take part in debriefing are warned that the process has the capacity to do harm as well as good . 
Compulsory debriefing , which is still used in some organizations , must cease forthwith . 
But should we be skeptical of all &quot; talking treatments ? &quot; 
Unlike debriefing , there is overwhelming evidence that some talking treatments , such as cognitive therapy or cognitive behavior therapy , is effective when applied to disorders such as depression , panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . 
What is the difference then between these talking therapies and the vogue for debriefing ? 
Two things . 
First , unlike debriefing these interventions work not on normal people who have been exposed to adversity , but on those who have a definite psychiatric disorder . 
Second , these are skilled interventions , delivered by practitioners with well defined and well regulated professional skills , who are either clinical psychologists or psychiatrists . 
They are also given over a period of time . 
Sadly in mental health , effective treatments are neither swift nor easily learnt . 
There is also a final paradox . 
When disaster strikes , it is the experience of all health professionals that they are often overwhelmed with offers of help . 
After the shootings at Columbine high school in the US a few years ago , the school received over 3,000 offers from people willing to come and &quot; debrief &quot; the children . 
But it is the mundane , non-newsworthy traumas of life that cause real harm . 
The old people shattered by a burglary . 
The wife driven to depression by her husband &apos;s infidelity . 
The bank manager who cannot get to work because of panic attacks . 
Or the teenager disabled by obsessive compulsive disorder . 
For them finding skilled psychological therapies and therapists is rarely easy , even though in all of these instances the evidence of effectiveness is beyond dispute . 
So we should take a long , hard look at how we manage our resources . 
It seems better to concentrate on delivering effective treatments to the smaller number of people who really need them , and not on the larger number of people who don &apos;t . 
The story of debriefing provides a salutary lesson . 
First , people are more resilient than we give them credit for . 
Second , no matter how well meaning our attempts to reduce distress and prevent psychiatric disorder , and no matter how self-evident the intervention , we still require firm proof of the benefits . 
Any health care intervention has the capacity to do harm as well as good , and occasionally the balance between the two will surprise us .
