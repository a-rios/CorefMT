The Profit-Sharing Economy 
BERKELEY - Over the last 35 years , real wages in the United States failed to keep pace with productivity gains ; for the typical non-farm worker , the latter grew twice as fast as the former . 
Instead , an increasing share of the gains went to a tiny fraction of workers at the very top - typically high-level managers and CEOs - and to shareholders and other capital owners . 
In fact , while real wages fell by about 6 % for the bottom 10 % of the income distribution and grew by a paltry 5-6 % for the median worker , they soared by more than 150 % for the top 1 % . 
How can this troubling trend be ameliorated ? 
One potential solution is broad-based profit-sharing programs . 
Together with job training and opportunities for workers to participate in problem-solving and decision-making , such programs have been shown to foster employee engagement and loyalty , reduce turnover , and boost productivity and profitability . 
Profit sharing also benefits workers . 
Indeed , workers in companies with inclusive profit-sharing and employee-ownership programs typically receive significantly higher wages than workers in comparable companies without such arrangements . 
About half of Fortune &apos;s list of the 100 best companies to work for have some kind of profit-sharing or stock-ownership program that extends beyond executives to include regular workers . 
Despite the demonstrated benefits of broad-based profit-sharing programs , only about one-third of US private-sector workers participate in them , and about 20 % own stock in their companies . 
If these programs work so well , why are they not more widespread ? 
First , executives for whom shared profits already account for a significant portion of income may resist programs that distribute profits to more workers , fearing that their own income would decline . 
Even when such programs increase overall profitability , they could reduce the profits going to top management and shareholders . 
Second , workers are concerned that profit-sharing may come at the expense of wages , with the substitution of uncertain profits for certain wages resulting in lower overall compensation . 
Effective profit-sharing schemes must be structured to prevent this outcome , and strong collective bargaining rights can help provide the necessary safeguards . 
Third , if inclusive profit-sharing programs are to have the desired effect on productivity , they should be combined with other initiatives to empower workers . 
One way to achieve this is by establishing &quot; works councils , &quot; elected groups of employees with rights to information and consultation , including on working conditions . 
Works councils and strong collective bargaining rights , both features of high-productivity workplaces , are common in developed economies . 
But they are lacking in the US , where federal law makes it difficult for companies to establish works councils and prohibits negotiations between employers and employees over working conditions outside of collective bargaining , even though most workers lack collective bargaining rights . 
Promisingly , the United Automobile Workers union recently announced that , as it continues to push for collective bargaining rights , it is also cooperating with management to form a works council in the German-owned Volkswagen plant in Tennessee . 
The fourth impediment to the establishment of profit-sharing programs is that they require a fundamental shift in corporate culture . 
Though most companies emphasize the importance of their human capital , top executives and shareholders still tend to view labor primarily as a cost driver , rather than a revenue driver - a view embedded in traditional and costly-to-change human-resources practices . 
Unlike the financial benefits of reducing labor costs , the financial benefits of profit sharing , realized gradually through greater employee engagement and reduced turnover , are difficult to measure , uncertain , and unlikely to have an immediate effect on earnings per share , a major determinant of executive compensation . 
It is unsurprising , therefore , that the advantages of profit-sharing are undervalued by many companies , especially those that focus on short-term success metrics . 
Moreover , even when they do recognize the advantages of profit sharing , companies may lack the technical knowledge needed to design a program that suits their needs . 
Some states have established technical-assistance offices primarily to help small and medium-size companies overcome this gap . 
The federal government should create its own technical-assistance program to build on states &quot; efforts and reach a larger number of companies . 
From a policy perspective , much more can be done to encourage firms to create broad-based profit-sharing arrangements . 
Current US law allows businesses to deduct from their taxable income the wages of all employees , except the top five executives , for whom deductions are limited to $ 1 million of annual pay , unless the excess compensation is &quot; performance-related . &quot; 
Spurred partly by this tax incentive , corporations have shifted top executives &quot; compensation toward shares , options , and other forms of profit sharing and stock ownership , largely leaving out regular workers . 
Some have proposed limiting the tax deduction for performance-based pay to firms with broad-based profit-sharing programs . 
But , although this approach might encourage profit sharing with more workers , it would continue to provide companies with significant tax breaks for huge compensation packages for top executives . 
US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has a more targeted proposal : a 15 % tax credit for profits that companies distribute to workers over two years . 
By providing temporary tax relief , the scheme would help companies offset the administrative costs of establishing a profit-sharing program . 
In order to limit costs and prevent abuse , profits totaling more than 10 % on top of an employee &apos;s wage would be excluded ; the overall amount offered to individual firms would be capped ; and safeguards against the substitution of profit sharing for wages , raises , and other benefits would be established . 
The tax credit could also foster changes in corporate culture , by spurring board-level discussions not only of the benefits of profit sharing , but also of sharing information and decision-making authority with employees . 
The stagnant incomes of the majority of US workers are undermining economic growth on the demand side ( by discouraging household consumption ) and on the supply side ( through adverse effects on educational opportunity , human-capital development , and innovation ) . 
It is time to take action to promote stronger and more equitable growth . 
Clinton &apos;s profit-sharing proposal is a promising step in the right direction .
