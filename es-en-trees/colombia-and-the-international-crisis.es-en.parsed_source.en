Colombia and the International Crisis 
BOGOTA - Just five months ago , Colombia &apos;s government was assuring its citizens that they were protected from the international crisis . 
This bleak forecast marks the end of Colombia &apos;s longest cycle of growth in three decades , leaving the country in the same fragile situation as that of many other developing economies . 
Of course , a deteriorating economy is not exclusive to Colombia . 
Since the middle of last year , the International Monetary Fund has been reducing its projections for growth across Latin America . 
Last October , the Fund estimated that growth in the region would reach 3.2 % this year ; now , it says that growth will barely be positive . 
And , most likely , the worst is yet to come : if the Obama administration does not succeed in stabilizing the United States economy in the coming weeks , Latin America will most likely face even steeper declines . 
The good news for Colombia is that it is better off than many of its neighbors . 
Although projecting concrete figures is a sterile exercise in these worrisome times , most analysts predict that Colombia &apos;s economic performance this year will be inferior to Peru &apos;s , but similar to Chile &apos;s and Brazil &apos;s and better than that of Argentina , Venezuela , and Mexico , a country expected to contract by more than 2 % . 
This comparatively benign situation reflects Colombia &apos;s relatively favorable macroeconomic conditions . 
Although the country was never as protected from the global downturn as its authorities claimed , the country benefits from some factors that do help ease the damage inflicted by the international crisis , especially with regard to the availability of foreign currency in these times of restrictions on external financing . 
During the past few years , Colombia has become one of the three most attractive destinations for foreign investment in Latin America , allowing it to cover a significant part of its external financing needs this year . 
Moreover , remittances by Colombians working abroad grew 8 % in 2008 , a surprising result when compared to countries such as Mexico and Ecuador , where remittances have fallen . 
In addition , international financial markets perceive Colombia &apos;s economy as being fundamentally sound . 
The current risk premium for government borrowing in international markets is very similar to that paid by Peru and Brazil , and much less than that demanded of Argentina , Venezuela , and Ecuador . 
But , while Colombia is not as bad off as some of its neighbors , the country will not be able to pull itself out of the crisis easily . 
Unfortunately , the authorities do not have much margin for error in working to counteract the damage done by the international crisis . 
The government did not set aside resources while things were going well , and now it does not have the fiscal space needed for an aggressive boost to public spending of the type that many other governments are attempting . 
Although Colombia &apos;s government announced a few weeks ago a strategy based on important infrastructure work , its impact will be limited : most of the investment was already in the budget last year , and the officials in charge of public works have consistently demonstrated inefficiency when executing large-scale projects . 
Meanwhile , the country &apos;s monetary authorities have much more leeway to boost the economy by lowering interest rates at a time when the threat of inflation is diminishing . 
In fact , the Bank of the Republic has reduced its interest rates from 10 % at the end of last year to 7 % at its last meeting in March . 
These policies should allow Colombia &apos;s economy to grow - barely - this year , but only as long as the world economy begins to stabilize before the end of the first quarter . 
If so , the outlook for Colombia is more favorable in 2010 and 2011 , when growth should be close to 3 % , thanks to inflows of foreign investment , improvements in security , and a better business environment . 
But if the international crisis lasts longer than the first half of 2010 , all bets are off , and Colombia will struggle to find its economic footing in a region devastated by generalized contraction .
