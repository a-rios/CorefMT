The Dear Leader Cleans House for the Young General 
SEOUL - There was a time , not long after the Cold War &apos;s end , when almost everyone assumed that North Korea would soon collapse . 
The sudden death in 1994 of Kim Il-sung , the founder of the tyrannical , economically disastrous North Korean experiment , reinforced this belief . 
That was then . 
Today , no one can credibly say that North Korea &apos;s dynastic regime , now led by &quot; Dear Leader &quot; Kim Jong-il , a son of the late &quot; Great Leader &quot; Kim Il-sung , is certain to fall . 
From insistence that the end of the Kim dynasty was approaching , consensus is emerging on the continued existence of their regime . 
Immediately after the stroke that killed his father at an exclusive summer resort villa on a remote mountain , Kim Jong-il consolidated political power by concentrating it in the hands of a very few diehard loyalists - and jailing , torturing , and killing anyone he viewed as a political opponent . 
Nevertheless , despite his long tenure , the Dear Leader &apos;s hold on power sometimes has been threatened by a small group of dissidents . 
On April 22 , 2004 , a train explosion at Ryongchon killed 160 people and injured 1,300 . Many believe that it was an attempt to assassinate Kim , whose custom-built train passed through Ryongchon a few hours before the blast . 
Since then , South Korean intelligence institutions have been assessing Kim Jong-il &apos;s ability to organize an orderly dynastic succession . 
In particular , they have been monitoring the body count of senior North Korean officials who have suddenly retired , disappeared , or died in automobile accidents . 
Indeed , the number of recent changes in the North Korean hierarchy strongly suggests serious domestic opposition to the continuance of Kim &apos;s misbegotten rule . 
Kim Il-chol , 80 , an admiral and vice-minister for the armed forces , was removed from his post in May . 
He was sent into retirement supposedly because of his advanced age , but there are even older figures in North Korea &apos;s gerontocracy . 
In addition , Pak Nam-gi , the senior finance ministry official considered responsible for North Korea &apos;s botched issuance of a new currency last year , has disappeared , and Kim Yong-il , North Korea &apos;s prime minister , was fired on June 7 . 
Ri Je-gang , a senior Workers &quot; Party director , was killed in a bizarre car crash on June 2 . 
The most common explanation for all of these changes is that Kim is circling the wagons around himself and the Young General . 
A disciplined succession plan is needed because Kim is 68 and in bad health ( and thus unlikely to still be holding power in 2012 , the year he targeted for North Korea to become a &quot; Strong and Prosperous Country &quot; ) . 
In the meantime , the armed forces appear to remain loyal to Kim , willing to carry out his orders even at the risk of bringing the country to the brink of war , such as by sinking the South Korean naval ship Cheonan in March and warning of &quot; powerful nuclear deterrence &quot; against joint South Korean and American military drills . 
While the United Nations Security Council debates how to reprimand North Korea for the attack on the Cheonan , few people in South Korea believe that any punishment will deter Kim or shorten the life of his regime . 
Moreover , from the beginning South Korea had little faith in the UN even trying to act , due to China &apos;s veto in the Security Council . 
Indeed , China offered South Korea a veiled warning that it &quot; should not sweat the small stuff , &quot; implying that the unprovoked killing of 46 South Korean sailors is a petty matter , and certainly not one that will cause China to rethink its alliance with North Korea . 
North Korea &apos;s unpredictability and China &apos;s cynical irresponsibility appear to be boxing in South Korean President Lee Myung-bak &apos;s conservative government . 
Lee must not only calculate how tough to be with North Korea in response to the death of the Cheonan sailors , but also find a way to keep working with Kim Jong-il &apos;s police state . 
He will most likely opt for a tactical retreat in the confrontation . 
Instead of pushing for serious UN sanctions , Lee &apos;s government will eventually , it seems , focus on reviving the six-party ( South and North Koreas , the United States , China , Japan , and Russia ) talks to end the North &apos;s nuclear-weapons program . 
There is no way to know what will happen in North Korea when Kim dies . 
For now , South Korea will need to rely on lionhearted tolerance in its relations with the North , because there is simply no other viable option at hand .
