Confronting the UN \ u0027s Anti-Human Rights Lobby 
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , Mary Robinson is to be replaced by the Brazilian Sergio Vieira de Mello , a longtime UN diplomat , on September 12 th . 
That transition will be a tricky one , because the governments that dominate the UN commission for human rights ( CHR ) are increasingly trying to protect themselves - and their allies - from any scrutiny or criticism . 
During the last annual session of the CHR , held in Geneva last spring , the body voted one by one to ignore severe human rights violations in such places as Russia / Chechnya , Zimbabwe , Iran and Equatorial Guinea . 
For several other violators - such as China , Algeria , Uzbekistan , Vietnam and Saudi Arabia - the CHR couldn &apos;t even muster the will to put their abuses on its agenda . 
It also cut back on several country-specific monitoring mechanisms , compromising one of the most powerful of human rights tools , that of naming and shaming . 
This is happening , in part , because countries with vile human rights records - Algeria , Burundi , China , Cuba , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Indonesia , Kenya , Libya , Malaysia , Saudi Arabia , Sudan , Syria , and Vietnam - command a powerful bloc within the CHR . 
They compose a near majority on the fifty _ three member body . 
In 2003 , Zimbabwe will joined them and , unless African countries reverse an earlier decision , Libya will chair this body for a year ! 
Such countries go out of their way to secure seats on the commission and then actively work to build alliances with pliable governments . 
In addition , they have developed a number of clever procedural ploys to undermine the commission . 
Their resolve to render the commission toothless is not matched by a balancing impulse on the part of the traditional promoters of human rights in the West . 
To some extent , this is because - all rhetoric notwithstanding - human rights rank relatively low among these governments &apos; priorities . 
Trade often trumps human rights and governments , especially in Europe , are often loath to jeopardize lucrative contacts when governments that violate human rights retaliate at being criticized . 
These tendencies have been compounded more recently by the war against terrorism . 
Western democracies are unwilling to irritate important allies in the counter-terrorism struggle simply because they might be violating the rights of their own citizens . 
During the past year , for the first time in its history , the US was not a member of the Commission ( though it will be regaining its seat in 2003 ) . 
You might think that America &apos;s absence contributed to the CHR &apos;s sorry state as , in the past , the US was often principled and outspoken on some issues , in particular regarding certain specific abusive countries . 
But you would be wrong . 
Increasingly obsessed at the prospect of its own citizens and practices coming under international scrutiny , America has over the past few years contributed to the general erosion of the UN human rights monitoring system . 
It adamantly opposed several important and promising new human rights initiatives , notably the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , and a new anti-torture mechanism . 
On the anti-torture protocol , the US sought to derail the creation of a universal system of visits to places of detention , under an optional protocol to the Convention Against Torture . 
Here America found itself allied with some strange bedfellows that it normally rebukes as chronic human rights violators - Cuba , China , Iran , Libya , Sudan or Zimbabwe . 
Yet , without US support , the initiative was overwhelmingly endorsed in late July by the UN &apos;s Economic and Social Council . 
Of course , not everything in the UN &apos;s human rights picture is uniformly bleak . 
The International Criminal Court will be beginning its work soon , and with greater international support than expected , thanks to America &apos;s efforts to undermine it . 
The universal system of visits to places of detention is gaining ground . 
Even at the CHR , there has been some recent progress , for example , on work to establish &quot; disappearances &quot; as an international crime . 
Here , countries with fresh memories of repressive rule , such as Latin American and East European nations , have increasingly taken the lead in promoting human rights initiatives and defending the principles . 
( Latin America , in particular , played a pivotal role in all the situations described above . ) 
All the same , manipulation by powerful countries and the foes of human rights have left the CHR in bad shape . 
Vieira de Mello - who has had a distinguished career in the UN system and is a brilliant diplomat - must be willing and able to draw on his own region and on others to make sure that the UN human rights system serves the victims rather than the violators . 
But he will also need to entice the West into becoming more pro-active and the US in particular into re-establishing its role as a constructive rather than destructive force in human rights affairs .
