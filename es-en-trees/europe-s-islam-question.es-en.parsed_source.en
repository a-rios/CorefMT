Europe &apos;s Islam Question 
OXFORD - The growing Muslim presence in Europe has become a central issue for all European countries , east and west . 
The numerous debates that have been breaking out across the continent about &quot; multiculturalism , &quot; &quot; secularity , &quot; or even &quot; identity &quot; are almost always connected to this &quot; Islamic &quot; factor . 
This link is not necessarily bigoted , because there is a fundamental relationship between &quot; values &quot; and &quot; laws &quot; on the one hand , and &quot; culture &quot; and &quot; diversity &quot; on the other . 
Indeed , more than a debate over &quot; Islam &quot; and the &quot; Muslims , &quot; Europe needs a serious dialogue with itself over this relationship , for it is facing a crisis . 
The right question to ask is this : can Europe remain consistent with its own values ( democracy , equality , justice , respect , etc . ) and at the same time tolerate and accommodate new citizens from different backgrounds and religions ? 
Or , to put it differently , are Europeans intellectually , linguistically , and culturally equipped to face the challenge of marrying equality with an ever more diverse European citizenry ? 
The starting point here is actually clear : governments should not confuse socioeconomic problems ( unemployment , violence , marginalization , etc . ) with questions about culture and religion . 
In other words , one should not &quot; culturize , &quot; &quot; religionize , &quot; or &quot; islamize &quot; social problems . 
The fact that a majority of Europeans who face unemployment or social marginalization are black , Asian , North African , or Muslim does not mean that their religion , ethnicity , or culture explains their situation . 
Any kind of cultural , religious , or racial determinism is dangerous : unemployment and marginalization reflect socioeconomic processes , and we need clear social and economic policies to resolve them . 
Resorting to vague cultural / religious / racial explanations is a recipe for inaction , if not for misguided action . 
Cultural , racial , and religious dimensions may , of course , be subordinate factors that need to be considered , but they are not the main causes of unemployment and marginalization . 
European governments , instead of following the suggestions of far-right rhetoric , should reconcile themselves to pursuing strong and creative policies to address the underlying problems of education ( segregated or second-class schools , curricula , etc . ) , unequal employment opportunities , and urban decay . 
Indeed , contrary to what has become conventional wisdom ( sadly , normalizing what far-right parties have been saying ) , young European Muslims do not have a problem with religious or cultural &quot; integration . &quot; 
Instead , they are frustrated by the absence ( or the failure ) of social policies to address their needs . 
This failure does not mean that a new kind of racism - &quot; Islamophobia &quot; - is on the march . 
But no one can deny that some individuals do face discrimination because of their &quot; religion &quot; ( according to a recent Pew survey , 45 % of Europeans have a negative image of Islam ) . 
The key sign that discrimination has been injected into the current discourse is the obsession with the idea of &quot; integration , &quot; despite the fact that the vast majority of European Muslims abide by the law , know the language of the country in which they reside , and are loyal to their country ( though sometimes critical , like their fellow citizens ) . 
Ceaseless reference to citizens &quot; with an immigrant background , &quot; or to the &quot; host society , &quot; only serves to nurture the idea that Muslims are not &quot; truly &quot; Europeans or &quot; at home . &quot; 
Such talk implies that European Muslims must constantly prove their loyalty . 
This perception of &quot; Muslims &quot; as being the &quot; other &quot; or the &quot; foreigner &quot; is the central factor that incites discrimination in the job or housing markets . 
Beyond insecurity and fear , it is crucial to rely on facts and figures to show that , both at the local and the national levels , the situation is much better than the passionate and polarized debates fostered in the media and some political circles . 
Far from the ongoing controversies , European Muslims are doing very well today , and the future is promising . 
If European countries want to remain faithful to their embrace of universal and equal human rights and avoid any temptation or slide towards racism and xenophobia , all Europeans must act . 
European Muslims should avoid nurturing a &quot; victim mentality &quot; and acknowledge their responsibilities within their respective societies . 
European governments and citizens , Muslim and non-Muslim alike , must shun any kind of racism . 
Education is central here . 
School curricula must become more inclusive ( to build a common history of memories ) and broaden students &quot; knowledge of religions and cultures . 
In the media , journalists should be trained to spot &quot; success stories , &quot; not just problems . 
In all cases , rhetoric that draws an implicit link between the words &quot; illegal , &quot; &quot; criminal , &quot; and &quot; immigrant &quot; or &quot; Muslim &quot; should be seen as nurturing fear and xenophobic reactions . 
Muslims are facing a new racism , and they have to strive for their rights , but they should do so alongside their fellow citizens and in many fields : domestic and foreign politics , education , media , and social activism . 
Europeans must stop being complacent in the belief that they are somehow protected from any resurgence of racism or betrayal of fundamental human rights .
