Models Behaving Badly 
LONDON - &quot; Why did no one see the crisis coming ? &quot; 
Queen Elizabeth II asked economists during a visit to the London School of Economics at the end of 2008 . 
Four years later , the repeated failure of economic forecasters to predict the depth and duration of the slump would have elicited a similar question from the queen : Why the overestimate of recovery ? 
Consider the facts . 
In its 2011 forecast , the International Monetary Fund predicted that the European economy would grow by 2.1 % in 2012 . 
In fact , it looks certain to shrink this year by 0.2 % . 
In the United Kingdom , the 2010 forecast of the Office for Budget Responsibility ( OBR ) projected 2.6 % growth in 2011 and 2.8 % growth in 2012 ; in fact , the UK economy grew by 0.9 % in 2011 and will flat-line in 2012 . 
The OECD &apos;s latest forecast for eurozone GDP in 2012 is 2.3 % lower than its projection in 2010 . 
Likewise , the IMF now predicts that the European economy will be 7.8 % smaller in 2015 than it thought just two years ago . 
Some forecasters are more pessimistic than others ( the OBR has a particularly sunny disposition ) , but no one , it seems , has been pessimistic enough . 
Economic forecasting is necessarily imprecise : too many things happen for forecasters to be able to foresee all of them . 
So judgment calls and best guesses are an inevitable part of &quot; scientific &quot; economic forecasts . 
But imprecision is one thing ; the systematic overestimate of the economic recovery in Europe is quite another . 
Indeed , the figures have been repeatedly revised , even over quite short periods of time , casting strong doubt on the validity of the economic models being used . 
These models , and the institutions using them , rely on a built-in theory of the economy , which enables them to &quot; assume &quot; certain relationships . 
It is among these assumptions that the source of the errors must lie . 
Two key mistakes stand out . 
The models used by all of the forecasting organizations dramatically underestimated the fiscal multiplier : the impact of changes in government spending on output . 
Second , they overestimated the extent to which quantitative easing ( QE ) by the monetary authorities - that is , printing money - could counterbalance fiscal tightening . 
Until recently , the OBR , broadly in line with the IMF , assumed a fiscal multiplier of 0.6 : for every dollar cut from government spending , the economy would shrink by only 60 cents . 
This assumes &quot; Ricardian equivalence &quot; : debt-financed public spending at least partly crowds out private spending through its impact on expectations and confidence . 
If households and firms anticipate a tax increase in the future as a result of government borrowing today , they will reduce their consumption and investment accordingly . 
On this view , if fiscal austerity relieves households of the burden of future tax increases , they will increase their spending . 
This may be true when the economy is operating at full employment - when state and market are in competition for every last resource . 
But when there is spare capacity in the economy , the resources &quot; freed up &quot; by public-sector retrenchment may simply be wasted . 
Forecasting organizations are finally admitting that they underestimated the fiscal multiplier . 
The OBR , reviewing its recent mistakes , accepted that &quot; the average &#91; fiscal &#93; multiplier over the two years would have needed to be 1.3 - more than double our estimate - to fully explain the weak level of GDP in 2011-12 . &quot; 
The IMF has conceded that &quot; multipliers have actually been in the 0.9 and 1.7 range since the Great Recession . &quot; 
The effect of underestimating the fiscal multiplier has been systematic misjudgment of the damage that &quot; fiscal consolidation &quot; does to the economy . 
This leads us to the second mistake . 
Forecasters assumed that monetary expansion would provide an effective antidote to fiscal contraction . 
The Bank of England hoped that by printing £ 375 billion of new money , ( $ 600 billion ) , it would stimulate total spending to the tune of £ 50 billion , or 3 % of GDP . 
But the evidence emerging from successive rounds of QE in the UK and the US suggests that while it did lower bond yields , the extra money was largely retained within the banking system , and never reached the real economy . 
This implies that the problem has mainly been a lack of demand for credit - reluctance on the part of businesses and households to borrow on almost any terms in a flat market . 
These two mistakes compounded each other : If the negative impact of austerity on economic growth is greater than was originally assumed , and the positive impact of quantitative easing is weaker , then the policy mix favored by practically all European governments has been hugely wrong . 
There is much greater scope for fiscal stimulus to boost growth , and much smaller scope for monetary stimulus . 
This is all quite technical , but it matters a great deal for the welfare of populations . 
All of these models assume outcomes on the basis of existing policies . 
Their consistent over-optimism about these policies &quot; impact on economic growth validates pursuing them , and enables governments to claim that their remedies are &quot; working , &quot; when they clearly are not . 
This is a cruel deception . 
Before they can do any good , the forecasters must go back to the drawing board , and ask themselves whether the theories of the economy underpinning their models are the right ones .
