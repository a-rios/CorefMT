China &apos;s Plenum Test 
TOKYO - There is something odd and disturbing about the conventional wisdom surrounding the upcoming Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) . 
As the November 9-12 conclave draws near , the international community &apos;s attention seems to be focused mainly on technocratic policy changes deemed essential to restructuring China &apos;s state-dominated economy and reenergizing growth . 
Will the government liberalize interest rates or loosen capital controls ? 
How will the fiscal system be revamped ? 
Will land reform be part of the package ? 
The list of such questions goes on . 
Outside China , the prevalent view among business leaders is that President Xi Jinping &apos;s new administration has consolidated its power and acquired enough authority to push through far-reaching economic reforms . 
On the surface , such thinking may seem reasonable . 
In China &apos;s top-down political system , a unified leadership is seen as fully capable of forcing the bureaucracy to comply with its wishes . 
With Xi &apos;s anti-corruption campaign in full swing , and the example of Bo Xilai &apos;s imprisonment serving as a warning to the new president &apos;s adversaries ( no matter how senior they are ) , Chinese officials at all levels , it is widely believed , are likely to toe the line . 
Unfortunately , this view is both too sanguine and na√Øve . 
It overestimates the effectiveness of anti-corruption campaigns in contemporary China ( there have been many in the last three decades ) , and it overlooks the political sources of the country &apos;s economic slowdown . 
While Xi &apos;s efforts to cleanse the rot inside the Chinese party-state should be applauded , it is no less important to recognize their limits . 
So far , Xi &apos;s campaign has remained a conventional affair involving selective prosecution . 
Given the central government &apos;s well-known inability to enforce its policies at the local level and the prevalence of tight-knit patronage networks in Chinese provinces and cities , it is unrealistic to expect that the current anti-corruption drive will produce significantly better results than in the past . 
Indeed , the fight against corruption is at war with itself , because Xi is simultaneously seeking to buttress one-party rule . 
But it is precisely the absence of effective checks on the exercise of power that encourages and sustains rampant corruption in the first place . 
Optimism about the CCP &apos;s ability to push through market-oriented reforms also ignores the real obstacles to future growth and prosperity , which do not include a lack of economic ideas or policy expertise ; on the contrary , it is well known - even obvious - what kind of economic reforms are needed . 
What prevents China from pursuing these reforms is a combination of opposition from powerful entrenched interest groups - state-owned enterprises , local governments , the economic-policy bureaucracy , and family members of political elites and well-connected businessmen - and flawed political institutions . 
Unless Xi and his colleagues demonstrate their resolve to overcome such opposition and launch comprehensive reforms , their chances of success are not high . 
Compared with the two previous breakthroughs in reforming China &apos;s economy , in 1978 and 1992 , Xi faces a different environment and a much tougher challenge . 
Opponents of Deng Xiaoping &apos;s reforms were ideologically driven ; they had no personal stake in the Maoist political economy . 
Defeating them required building a winning coalition within the party , discrediting the communist ideology , and rallying public support , all of which Deng did . 
Today , by contrast , members of the ruling elite benefit directly and immensely from the state-dominated economy . 
Market-oriented reform , by leveling the competitive playing field , would hurt their interests and reduce their privileges , making fierce opposition likely . 
Only by mobilizing pressure outside the party-state can these insiders be forced to accept some of the decentralizing and liberalizing reforms that China &apos;s economy needs . 
At that point , China will have a better chance of improving its legal institutions , increasing political accountability , strengthening protection of private property rights , and making the government genuinely - in Mao &apos;s words - &quot; serve the people . &quot; 
Without real and significant political change , technocratic reform proposals will treat only the symptoms of China &apos;s economic malaise , without addressing its underlying institutional causes . 
In assessing the outcome of the Third Plenum , what observers should really be looking for is evidence of a bold strategy for political reform . 
If Xi and his colleagues produce no credible sign of such a commitment , everything else will be eyewash - and skepticism about China &apos;s fate under their leadership eventually will be vindicated .
