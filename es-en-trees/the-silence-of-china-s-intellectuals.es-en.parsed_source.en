The Silence of China \ u0027s Intellectuals 
Public opinion , as the crisis over the US spy plane demonstrated , now matters in China . 
But where do China &apos;s intellectuals stand and what role do they play ? 
In the 1980s traditional Chinese respect for education was revived after the scourge of the Mao years . 
So was the Confucian notion that an intellectual &apos;s highest calling is to tell a ruler what is best for the realm , whether by persuasion or - if you dare - through criticism and taking the consequences . 
In 1979 , Liu Binyan &apos;s &quot; People or Monsters ? &quot; spelled out how communism breeds corruption ; in 1988 Su Xiaokang &apos;s film &quot; River Elegy &quot; sketched ways in which aspects of the narrow-minded despotism in China &apos;s imperial tradition remained alive and well in the Party . 
Both works - and others of the 1980s - mesmerized the public . 
The years since the Tienanmen Massacre seem politically and intellectually anemic by comparison . 
After 1989 China seemed to lose its moral compass . 
Yet , at a time when an intellectual &apos;s conscience might seem most useful - they were inaudible . 
Why ? 
Repression is one reason . 
Ironclad taboos prevented public discussion of such subjects as the Cultural Revolution , the Tienanmen Massacre , Falun Gong or other topics perceived as vita the regime &apos;s legitimacy and hold on power . 
Moreover , most of China &apos;s leading public intellectuals of the 1980s fled the country after 1989 . 
A new generation of intellectual leaders needed time to emerge . 
The collapse of socialist morality and the regime &apos;s failure to provide a credible replacement created a &quot; values vacuum &quot; that people sought to fill in various ways . 
Falun Gong boomed , as did Christianity and other religions . 
Some people embraced nationalism and chauvinism . 
Contemporary intellectuals embraced all these trends . 
In addition , literary intellectuals - who in the 1980s led the way in criticism - fell prey to Western postmodernist jargon , even though such things have little resonance in China . 
State-sponsored repression , however , only partially explains the silence since 1989 . 
Urban China &apos;s rapid economic growth also shaped intellectual life . 
Many scholars and writers &quot; jumped into the ocean of commerce &quot; ( xiahai ) to became more comfortable than twenty years ago , when intellectuals lived on tiny salaries and were still emerging from Mao &apos;s censure that they were society &apos;s &quot; stinking dregs . &quot; 
Today , intellectuals with marketable skills use them to make more in business than they ever could in academe . 
The social and economic status of better-off intellectuals is second only to Communist officials and the new super-rich . 
Moreover , the freedoms that intellectuals treasure - speech , publication , and travel - expanded greatly . 
New subcultures , and even publications flourish so long as they avoid politically sensitive subjects . 
In short , personal comfort resulted in political timidity and complacency . 
Yet , economic boom generated an ugly gap between rich and poor , and the new political-moral questions that have arisen about this gap show that the Chinese intellectuals &apos; tradition of &quot; worrying about the nation &quot; remains alive . 
How , they ask , can we accept the ways in which newly rich secured their wealth by exploiting power to steal state property ? 
Regardless of how wealth was acquired , they wonder if society can accept the grotesque disparities that resulted ? 
These questions create an awkward dilemma for intellectuals who favor opening to the West . 
True , the West offers models of democracy , rule of law , a free press , and other means through which injustices can be resolved ; but the West also provided the capitalist model that created these injustices . 
So , do you call for more Westernization or less ? 
Will membership in the World Trade Organization do more harm or good ? 
Is more Western pop culture advisable ? 
A diverse , confusing spectrum of muted views has resulted . 
A &quot; new left &quot; embraces the poor , but wants to remain distinct from the authoritarian &quot; old left . &quot; 
Liberals have grown their own left and right wings - mainly over the issue of social justice versus political freedom . 
These complexities make it more difficult than before the 1980s for Chinese intellectuals to speak in unison , let alone find their voice . 
The main issues back then - &quot; more reform &quot; and &quot; more opening to the West &quot; - were not freighted with ambiguity and controversy . 
So , the &quot; silence &quot; of Chinese intellectuals has several causes , and is in part illusory . 
Yet , if we ask the Confucian question , &quot; Have intellectuals offered anything that a wise ruler might use ? &quot; the answer is yes . 
In terms of research and careful reasoning , books like He Qinglian &apos;s &quot; Modernization &apos;s Pitfalls &quot; on the weaknesses of the urban economy and Cao Jinqing &apos;s &quot; China by the Yellow River &quot; about poverty and oppression in the countryside - to name two such works - are more substantial than many of the generalities offered in the 1980s . 
Unfortunately , China &apos;s leaders , deeply unsure of themselves , are in no mood to accept advice . 
Late last year a publishing ban was imposed on ten leading intellectuals . 
Several were fired from state-sponsored jobs . 
Happily , because the state no longer has monolithic control , some banned writers found other work , even publishing outlets , on their own . 
Defiance , indeed , is now the exception rather than the rule . 
But the government still is unwilling to listen .
