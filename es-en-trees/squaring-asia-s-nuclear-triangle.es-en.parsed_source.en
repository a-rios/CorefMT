Squaring Asia &apos;s Nuclear Triangle 
TOKYO - Just before the fourth trilateral summit between Japan , China , and South Korea began on May 21 , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao , South Korean President Lee Myung-bak , and Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan jointly visited the areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake , offering encouragement to the disaster &apos;s victims living in evacuation centers . 
Since the accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in March , Kan has aimed at lifting the bans that many countries have imposed on imports of Japanese agricultural products , and so offered the two heads of state cherries from Fukushima in a bid to highlight their safety . 
At the summit , the three countries issued a joint statement outlining cooperation on a wide range of issues , including nuclear safety , disaster prevention , economic growth , and the environment . 
The lessons learned from Japan &apos;s earthquake and nuclear accident would be shared with China , South Korea , and the wider international community , and , in an addendum , the Japanese authorities promised to &quot; continue to provide information ... with the greatest transparency possible . &quot; 
In fact , the Kan administration - which loathes the involvement of bureaucrats , who are professionals , in managing public affairs - delayed notifying neighboring countries when it was forced to order the release of water containing low concentrations of radioactive material . 
For Kan , the real priority was his government &apos;s effort to maintain its grip on power , not reassuring Japan &apos;s neighbors of the actions it was taking to contain a potential threat to their citizens . 
The codicil to the summit communiqué was created to address these concerns . 
It emphasized the importance of sharing information about nuclear safety , and incorporated specific measures , including the creation of a framework for rapid notification in the event of an emergency and exchanges of experts to assist in managing future nuclear crises and ensuring that regional concerns are taken into account . 
Ever since the Fukushima accident , opposition to nuclear power has been growing in China and South Korea , both of which had been planning a massive expansion of their nuclear generating capacity - and both of which face a change of political leadership next year . 
China &apos;s succession , though set , will nonetheless bring a period of uncertainty , while South Korea will undoubtedly face its usual no-holds-barred democratic battle in its coming presidential election . 
Given these political realities , keeping ordinary citizens content about civilian nuclear power has become a greater priority than usual in both countries . 
This confluence of political need has created an opportunity for all three countries to cooperate more closely in the management of civilian nuclear power , and this opportunity should not be missed . 
Sensing this , China and South Korea have provided humanitarian and economic aid to areas affected by the earthquake , and both countries were quick to send specialized teams to Japan to search for the missing . 
The first country to send a rescue team to Japan , however , was Taiwan ( which also was the largest single provider of donations , amounting to ¥ 20 billion ) . 
But , owing to what Kan &apos;s government called &quot; confusion on the ground , &quot; Taiwan &apos;s rescue team was kept waiting for days . 
And , while the people of Japan were grateful for Taiwan &apos;s unexpected generosity , the Japanese government failed to offer any thanks , despite running advertisements in major newspapers expressing gratitude for the relief sent from other countries . 
( Eventually , a public campaign raised the money to run an advertisement in a Taiwanese newspaper . ) 
Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou was as surprised as the Japanese by the size of the contributions made by his people . 
Ma had been tilting his government &apos;s policies increasingly toward China , concluding a bilateral framework agreement on economic cooperation . 
But , in the wake of Taiwanese society &apos;s outpouring of sympathy for Japan , he has adjusted his stance . 
The Ma government has also been kept on its toes by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party &apos;s call for the phase-out of nuclear power in Taiwan by 2025 . 
Taiwan has three nuclear power plants , and , like the plant at Fukushima , they directly face the ocean . 
Two are located within 20 kilometers of the capital , Taipei , and it is generally agreed that there would be no escape for the vast majority of the capital &apos;s citizens should a major nuclear accident occur . 
Construction of a fourth nuclear power plant , which began in 1999 , was suspended by DPP President Chen Shui-bian the following year . 
Although Chen &apos;s government , under pressure from the opposition Kuomintang , later restarted work on the plant , design revisions have repeatedly delayed its completion . 
Opposition from local residents remains stiff . 
At their recent trilateral summit , Japan , China , and South Korea skillfully evaded direct mention of the delicately poised security issues that they face . 
And , while they did bring nuclear safety to the fore and agreed to cooperate and share information with each other , efforts to meet this region-wide challenge cannot succeed without bringing Taiwan into the discussions . 
Taiwan should also be allowed to participate in the International Atomic Energy Agency in the area of nuclear safety , just as it became an observer at the World Health Organization during the SARS and avian flu pandemics of the 1990 &quot; s . 
Where nuclear safety is concerned , China must rethink its policy of isolating Taiwan from international bodies .
