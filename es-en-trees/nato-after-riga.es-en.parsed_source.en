NATO after Riga 
When the Soviet Union collapsed , many predicted the end of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) . 
Yet a few weeks ago , NATO held its summit meeting in the Latvian capital of Riga , formerly part of the USSR . 
NATO was created in 1949 as an alliance to contain Soviet power . 
Its focus was on Western Europe , and , as one joke went , it was designed to keep the Russians out , the Germans down , and the Americans in . 
Germany is a democracy firmly anchored in the European Union , and there is no threat of Soviet tanks sweeping across the North German plains . 
NATO survived by transforming itself . 
While some Central European members that were formerly occupied by the USSR continue to see NATO as a political insurance policy against a revival of Russian ambitions , NATO is no longer aimed against Russia . 
In fact , Russian officers are welcome to participate in military exercises and to visit NATO headquarters under the Partnership for Peace program . 
Residual suspicions and Russian pride limit the NATO-Russia agreement , but the organization is no longer focused on Russia . 
One major task that NATO performed in the first decade after the Cold War was to attract the newly freed countries of Central Europe toward the West , with the prospect of membership conditioned on meeting democratic standards . 
Another important task was to help bring stability to the troubled Balkan region after the breakup of Yugoslavia and the resultant wars in Bosnia and Kosovo . 
NATO peacekeeping operations have been a stabilizing factor in the region . 
For example , NATO and EU diplomacy prevented ethnic conflict in Macedonia from erupting into a crisis . 
While these actions were important , many observers argued that NATO would have to look beyond Europe . 
A common quip was that NATO would have to go &quot; out of area or out of business . &quot; 
This became particularly important after the Al Qaeda attacks on September 11 , 2001 , shifted the focus of American foreign policy toward transnational terrorism . 
The European members of NATO responded by invoking the Article 5 mutual defense clause of the NATO charter and coming to the aid of the US in Afghanistan , where today there are 32,000 NATO troops . 
Because they train together , NATO countries can operate effectively even when not all members of the organization are officially involved . 
For example , NATO did not conduct the Gulf War in 1991 or the initial Afghan campaign , but NATO planning and training meant that members could cooperate effectively when called upon to do so . 
At the same time , NATO after Riga faces a number of problems . 
Europe split over the American invasion of Iraq , and there is no political will to involve NATO there . 
The new relationship with Russia needs careful management , and rapid extension of membership to former Soviet republics like Ukraine and Georgia could prove difficult . 
In military terms , European countries need to spend more on secure communications , airlift capabilities , special operations , and dealing with chemical and biological battlefields in order to be able to fight the war on terrorism effectively . 
France is concerned that America &apos;s influence in NATO is too large , and opposes a global role in which NATO establishes special partnerships with Australia , New Zealand , Japan , and other countries . 
The French worry that NATO &apos;s global ambition , particularly in East Asia , could produce friction with China . 
But by far the biggest problem that NATO faces today is Afghanistan . 
Hamid Karzai &apos;s government remains weak , and the economy continues to be heavily dependent upon opium production . 
The Taliban and Al Qaeda networks are re-emerging as political and military threats . 
Many NATO countries with troops in Afghanistan have &quot; national caveats &quot; that restrict how their troops may be used . 
While the Riga summit relaxed some of these caveats to allow assistance to allies in dire circumstances , Britain , Canada , the Netherlands , and the US are doing most of the fighting in southern Afghanistan , while French , German , and Italian troops are deployed in the quieter north . 
It is difficult to see how NATO can succeed in stabilizing Afghanistan unless it is willing to commit more troops and give commanders more flexibility . 
Success will also require more funds for reconstruction , development , and alternatives to opium poppy cultivation . 
Governments in Europe and the US are concerned about budget problems , but in a larger perspective , providing significantly greater resources to Afghanistan now may turn out to save more funds later . 
One of the great costs of the Bush administration &apos;s mistaken Iraq policy has been to divert attention and resources away from the just war in Afghanistan . 
If only a small portion of the money and forces invested in Iraq had been devoted to Afghanistan , the current threat of a resurgent Taliban and Al Qaeda might not be so great . 
Unfortunately , Iraq is draining all the oxygen out of the policy process in Washington . 
Few people are focused on saving NATO from a significant failure in its first major test outside of Europe .
