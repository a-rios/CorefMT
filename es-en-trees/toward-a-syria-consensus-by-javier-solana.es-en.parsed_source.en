Toward a Syria Consensus 
MADRID - The feeling is growing stronger by the day that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime is approaching a tipping point . 
Kofi Annan , the United Nations and Arab League special envoy , has abandoned as hopeless his efforts to implement an internationally agreed six-point plan to end the violence . 
Now the international community must think seriously about how to minimize the dangers inherent in Syria &apos;s domestic turmoil . 
Lack of agreement within the UN Security Council has prolonged the conflict and contributed to changing its nature . 
What began as a popular uprising inspired by the demands of the Arab Spring has taken on increasingly sectarian and radical tones . This reflects loss of hope in international support , while making it more difficult to achieve a negotiated solution . 
In particular , there is a growing danger of Sunni retaliation against the Alawite minority , which comprises 12 % of the population , but controls the government , the economy , and the army . 
If the Syrian opposition does not take the Alawites &quot; concerns seriously , the country could be wracked by years of civil war , worse than the conflict that devastated Lebanon from 1975 to 1990 . 
The regional consequences are already being felt . 
Fighting between the rebels and government forces is spreading , and the resulting refugee flows into neighboring Turkey , Jordan , and Lebanon threaten to bring these countries directly into the conflict . 
Turkey is also worried about the conflict &apos;s possible repercussions for its Kurdish population , among whom aspirations for independence are resurfacing , and for its relations with the Kurdish populations of Iraq and Syria , which are woven into a complex balance . 
Jordan , for its part , considers the growing numbers of Syrian rebels entering its territory a threat to national security , while the arrival of thousands of refugees in Lebanon has revived old sectarian disputes in Tripoli between Shia Alawites , most of whom support Assad , and Sunnis , who overwhelmingly sympathize with the opposition . 
Chaos and confrontation could easily reach Iraq , too , where the possible fall of the Syrian regime seems to be revitalizing Sunni resistance to Nouri al-Maliki &apos;s predominantly Shia government . 
The outcome of the Syrian conflict will also have a direct impact on the Middle East &apos;s alignment of power . 
A Sunni takeover after Assad &apos;s fall would mean a change of strategy with respect to Iran and its Lebanese Shia ally , Hezbollah , whose viability might be in danger , as a Sunni government in Syria would most likely cut off the conduit for arms flowing from Iran to Lebanon . 
The disturbances in Syria have already weakened some of Iran &apos;s traditional alliances in the region . 
For example , Hamas has taken a position in favor of the Syrian opposition by emphasizing its ties with the Muslim Brothers , and gave its support last year to Egypt &apos;s transitional government after it permanently opened the frontier with Gaza . 
Although the complex situation in Egypt suggests that its leaders will be preoccupied with domestic politics for some time , the new government will also try to redefine its relations with neighboring countries . 
Significantly , Egypt &apos;s recently elected president , Mohamed Morsi , the leader of the Muslim Brothers &quot; political party , chose Saudi Arabia for his first official foreign visit , a decision laden with religious as well as political symbolism . 
For Saudi Arabia - which , along with Qatar , is arming the Syrian opposition - the post-Assad period is a strategic opportunity to break the alliance between Syria and Iran , and , at the same time , deliver a severe blow to Hezbollah . 
The weakening of the Iran-Syria-Hezbollah axis would directly benefit Israel , which has stepped up its not-so-veiled threats to launch a unilateral military strike against Iran &apos;s nuclear installations . 
Likewise , Israel accuses Hezbollah - together with Iran - of recent efforts to attack Israeli objectives , including the bombing of a bus carrying Israeli tourists in Bulgaria . 
This new scenario will doubtless affect Iran &apos;s position in the ongoing international talks on its nuclear program , which are fundamental to achieving a diplomatic solution . 
But , as long as the Syrian conflict continues , it will be difficult to make any progress with an Iran fearful of the impact that a new government in Syria might have on its regional influence . 
In the same way , achieving an agreement - or not - with Russia ( and thus with China ) to contain the Syrian crisis will also determine how much room for maneuver the United States and the European Union will have with these two countries to address Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
The Security Council &apos;s members agree on how to address Iran &apos;s nuclear program , but not on steps to resolve the Syria conflict , owing to fundamental disagreements between Russia ( and China ) and the rest . 
But these are , in effect , parallel negotiations , closely dependent on each other for progress . 
In order to reach an agreement , it is essential that Turkey , the Gulf States , and the Arab League forge a common position . 
Only in this way could they win the backing of the various sectors of Syrian opposition - suspicious of the intentions behind unilateral support - and bring their positions closer to those of Syria &apos;s minorities , which cannot be left out of this process . 
This would create more pressure for backing by the Security Council and set in motion a process leading to a transition policy in Syria . 
Reaching an agreement on a post-Assad scenario will not be easy , but no alternative is more promising for Syria and the region .
