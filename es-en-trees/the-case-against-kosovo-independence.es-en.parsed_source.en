The Case against Kosovo Independence 
Kosovo &apos;s march toward independence is gathering pace , with the leaders of Kosovo &apos;s Albanians - Hashim Thaci and Agim Ceku - threatening to declare unilateral independence any day now . 
This is something that Serbia will undoubtedly reject , with the backing of Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia . 
Much of the world seems to think that Serbia &apos;s role in the Balkan wars of the 1990 &quot; s puts it in the wrong , and that that should be the end of the matter . 
But Serbia &apos;s point of view is not without merit , and many other countries with territorially concentrated ethnic minorities have reason to be anxious about the precedent that might be set if Kosovo &apos;s declaration of independence is recognized . 
Consider , first , that Kosovo is the historical heart and religious soul of Serbia . 
Hundreds of Serb Orthodox churches , monasteries , and holy sites in Kosovo attest to this . 
Moreover , Kosovo &apos;s demographic transformation over the last 100 years , when Albanians overtook the local Serb population , partly reflects an influx of Albanians from Albania - for decades a political and economic basket case , owing to Enver Hoxha &apos;s hermetic communism . 
At the same time , many Serbs have left Kosovo before and after NATO &apos;s intervention in 1999 , whether fleeing from Albanian violence against them or simply lured by better opportunities in Serbia proper . 
Serbia &apos;s claim to Kosovo is , to Serbs , far stronger than Russia &apos;s claim to Chechnya , China &apos;s to Xinjiang , India &apos;s to Kashmir ( a claim still disputed by Pakistan ) , and the Philippines &quot; to the island of Mindanao . 
All of these are provinces with Muslim majority populations that are part of non-Muslim majority states . 
But Russia , China , and India are big states and will not tolerate any detachment of their territories . 
The Philippines has effectively lost control of Mindanao , just as Serbia has lost control of Kosovo , yet no one has recognized Mindanao &apos;s unilateral declaration of independence . 
So why should Kosovo &apos;s declaration be accepted ? 
Nor is it only Russia , China , and India that oppose Kosovo &apos;s independence , but also Muslim-majority Nigeria , which retains Biafra , where a bloody civil war with Catholic Ibos was fought in the late 1960 &quot; s . 
Muslim-majority Indonesia lost its Catholic-majority East Timor through Western political intervention , but its claims to East Timor were tenuous , as it only invaded the island a few decades ago . 
Even in Europe , where Catalonia and the Basque region push for secession from Spain , some in Flanders want an end to Belgium , and Scotland &apos;s ruling Scottish National Party wants eventually to break away from Britain , support for Kosovo &apos;s independence is far from universal . 
Worse , ordinary Serbs see an obvious international double standard . 
The territorial integrity and sovereignty of Croatia and Bosnia were enforced in the 1990 &quot; s , despite declarations of independence by the Serbian &quot; Republic of Krajina &quot; in Croatia and the Serbian &quot; Republika Srpska &quot; in Bosnia . 
Why is Kosovo being treated differently ? 
Today , there are roughly 700,000 Serb refugees in Serbia from Croatia and Bosnia who are unable or unwilling to return to their homes , including virtually all of Croatia &apos;s Serbs , except those converted to Catholicism to become Croats . 
Indeed , Serbia currently contains the largest refugee population in Europe . 
If Kosovo gains independence , these numbers will swell , as an exodus of all remaining Serbs is likely unless their territorial bastions - particularly in northern Kosovo , around Mitrovica - join with Serbia . 
More broadly , to allow Kosovo &apos;s independence would demonstrate that violent secessionism works . 
In that case , the world ought to get used to seeing the Kosovo &quot; strategy &quot; applied elsewhere . 
First , faceless ethnic secessionists attack civilians and police . 
Not knowing where the enemy is hidden within the civilian population , security forces retaliate indiscriminately . 
Human rights violations elicit an international outcry and condemnation , followed by intervention and occupation by foreign military forces . 
And , in the denouement , the state loses control of its province as the secessionists declare independence . 
Setting such a precedent in Kosovo must be avoided to ensure stability not only in the Balkans , but in all countries with dissatisfied ethnic minority populations . 
The territorial integrity and sovereignty of Serbia must be preserved in accordance with the United Nations Charter , the 1975 Helsinki Agreement Final Act guaranteeing the boundaries of Europe , and UN Resolution 1244 of 1999 , which guaranteed Serbia &apos;s existing borders . 
The former Yugoslavia has had enough destruction and mass killing . 
Preserving national integrity is a universal principle of peace from which Serbia should not be excluded .
