War Against the Laws of War 
The value of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the additional &apos; Protocols &apos; of 1977 is impossible to overestimate . 
In simple human terms , millions of people are alive today because these norms enabled the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) . 
Together , the conventions and protocols form what is misleadingly called international humanitarian law ( IHL ) , but which in fact regulate war - seeking to limit its effects , regardless of the rights and wrongs involved , and to restrict its methods , even in battles undertaken in a just cause . 
For example , many states now believe that the prohibition on intentionally targeting civilians is binding , and they act on that basis by actually limiting their battlefield tactics . 
Consider the transformation of American military behavior from the Vietnam era , when commanders spoke of destroying villages &quot; in order to save them , &quot; to its operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan , where military lawyers and even ICRC officials were consulted on what targets could be bombed . 
This progress , which gained a further institutional foothold with the establishment of the International Criminal Court last July , led many to believe that the triumph of international law is no longer a utopian hope but a practical prospect . 
The vision remains attractive , but in its moral seductiveness lies profound moral and intellectual danger . 
It is worth recalling Walter Benjamin &apos;s observation that &quot; every document of civilization is simultaneously a document of barbarism . &quot; 
Florence Nightingale understood this when she declined to join the ICRC &apos;s founder , Henri Dunant , in the 1860s . 
She argued that to set limits on war , as the ICRC devotes itself to doing , is also to make war more morally palatable to those who wage them and those who fight them . 
Indeed , the fetishization of any document has a religious cast that should make any thinking person skeptical . 
The law should be no more immune to critical examination than any other creed . 
When Jakob Kellenberger , the ICRC &apos;s current president , asserts that it is &quot; the principle of humanity &quot; that underlies all of IHL , we enter the realm of legal idolatry . 
But IHL is confronted not only by the ethical challenge of coping with its own moral hubris . 
War began to mutate in the last part of the 20 th century . 
Notwithstanding the horrors of the recent conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea and the likelihood of catastrophe accompanying any Anglo-American attack on Iraq , most wars nowadays are civil wars . 
As such , they are , almost by definition , less rule-bound than interstate wars . 
The reasons are simple and brutal . 
In civil wars , each side tends to deny the legitimacy , if not the humanity , of the other . 
The goal is less often victory on the battlefield than ethnic cleansing , subjugation , even genocide . 
If , as in Bosnia , a commander &apos;s goal is to replace the Muslim population of a given area with Serbs , then war has , by definition , been made indistinguishable from a war crime . 
Were such a Serb commander to fight by the rules outlined in IHL - that is , afford civilians a basic measure of protection - there would be no purpose in initiating hostilities in the first place . 
For the Bosnian Serbs in 1992 , the Rwandan Hutus in 1994 , or the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone , the real adversaries were not enemy combatants but the civilian population of a rival ethnic or cultural group . 
In such circumstances , law is useless . 
The commission of war crimes may trigger international intervention Ã  la Kosovo or East Timor . 
But the idea that such interventions can become customary , that great powers ( and only great powers have the resources to act effectively ) will commit their troops to kill and die in endless wars of altruism is utopian in the worst sense of the term - it is utterly unrealizable . 
So , far from having triumphed , international humanitarian law has never been more imperiled . 
The law assumes a moral consensus among states and warlords that exists only in rhetoric . 
Yes , the Rwandan government signed the Genocide Convention . 
But a signature does not mean sincerity . 
Obviously , some norms do eventually enlist the consent and support of those toward whom they are directed . 
The problem is that no law of nature guarantees this . 
Meanwhile , the actual conduct of intrastate war is growing more , not less , barbarous . 
In most conflicts , prisoners &apos; rights are routinely debased , torture is commonplace , and the inviolability of cultural and religious edifices is ignored . 
When Kellenberger cheers on the rise of a civil society supposedly determined to &quot; bring about greater respect for human rights and humanitarian law , &quot; he is mistaking his dreams for reality . 
In fact , the assault on IHL comes not simply from warlords from Ivory Coast to Chechnya to Aceh . 
It increasingly comes from states that , in their conduct of conventional military operations , tend to respect the laws of war . 
The so-called &quot; war on terrorism &quot; saw to this . 
The US , in particular , now believes that most of its adversaries are not soldiers in the conventional sense , but &quot; unlawful combatants &quot;  - people to whom the protections of the Geneva Conventions do not apply . 
If anything , the erosion of IHL now stems as much from decisions made in Washington as from the cruelties of militia commanders in West African jungles .
