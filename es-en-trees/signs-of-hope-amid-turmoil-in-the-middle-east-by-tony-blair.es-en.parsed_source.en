Hope Amid the Middle East &apos;s Turmoil 
LONDON - Syria is a living nightmare . 
Egypt hovers on the brink . 
Now is a time not for despair , but for active engagement . 
No one put the chances of reviving the Israel-Palestine peace process at more than minimal . 
To those of us who have toiled , often fruitlessly , on this issue in the past , it is a huge achievement brought about by US Secretary of State John Kerry &apos;s sheer dogged determination and the willingness of Israel &apos;s Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to take political risks with their domestic public opinion . 
Against all the odds , Yemen is undergoing a process of political transformation , with 500 delegates from all parts of society working on plans for democracy , justice , and equality . 
In Iraq , after years of declining sectarian violence , the casualty figures are up again , in part owing to the war in neighboring Syria . 
Yet , even in Iraq , Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani , the country &apos;s most influential Shia cleric , recently issued a seminal statement proclaiming the need for a civil , not religious state , with equal freedom for all to participate . 
Sistani also expressed disagreement with those close to Iran who want Shia to go to Syria to fight for Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime alongside Hezbollah . 
Similarly , at the start of Ramadan , King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia , who is also the custodian of the two holy mosques , made a powerful statement reclaiming the faith of Islam from those who would pervert it in the name of politics . 
Libya and Tunisia are far from settled , as the recent assassination of Tunisia &apos;s leading opposition politician and the presence of unrestrained militia in Libyan towns show . 
Across the northern part of Sub-Saharan Africa , there are now huge challenges from well-armed and well-financed terrorist groups that have imported toxic Islamist ideology from the Middle East . 
Countries such as Nigeria , for example , have suffered horribly from terrorism based on a brand of religious extremism that is alien to their society . 
Meanwhile , with a genuinely inclusive and objectively administered constitution , Egypt could pivot back toward democracy . 
Elections by early 2014 have been promised , and all parties , including the Muslim Brotherhood , could take part . 
Or Egypt could become paralyzed and unable to rectify its dire economic situation and restore order , without which no progress is possible . 
But Egypt &apos;s internal divisions reveal a deeper awakening in the region that has its own significance . 
Lessons about government , governance , and democracy that took the West centuries to learn are being taken in at extraordinary speed . 
It is now clear that the status quo in the region will not hold . 
The idea of &quot; strong man &quot; government - a regime that maintains order , and that the rest of the world likes to deal with because it is predictable - has gone . 
It doesn &apos;t matter whether the &quot; strong man &quot; is a psychopath , like Saddam Hussein , or a moderate , like Hosni Mubarak , who kept peace in the region . 
This is the twenty-first century , and ordinary people want to shape their country &apos;s politics . 
The choice is between evolution and revolution . 
Evolution , if attainable , is clearly preferable . 
Frankly , Syria would have been better for it . 
People have had a taste of politics conducted by firestorm . 
Across the region , there is fatigue with the wildness and disorder that politics conducted by firestorm brings . 
There is growing recognition that change is best accompanied by stability , and that democracy works only if debate is conducted in an atmosphere in which arguments can be bold , even harsh , but not inflammatory . 
There is also a burgeoning acceptance that religious freedom is a necessary part of free and open societies . 
The discussion about religion &apos;s role in government and society is now out in the open . 
For the first time , there is lively and intelligent debate around this issue , which is at the core of the Middle East &apos;s problems . 
Open societies are incompatible with closed economies . 
A functioning private sector that creates adequate jobs , and schools that educate the large young population for today &apos;s inter-connected world , are prerequisites of progress . 
The Israeli-Palestinian issue is crucial for all the obvious reasons . 
If these two peoples can find common ground to create two states , both democratic and free , after decades of bitterness and bloodshed , the region would have an enormously powerful model of hope . 
But the opening of the peace talks in Washington , DC , would not have happened without the full engagement of the US and other international partners . 
This is the lesson that we should bear in mind as Syria disintegrates before our eyes . 
However much we may wish to look away , the consequences of allowing the bloodbath in Syria to take its own course may well be disastrous for the region and for the West &apos;s security . 
Surely we can begin to see certain common threads running through the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 , Afghanistan , Iraq , the Arab revolutions , Iran , Syria , Egypt , and the spread of terror based on religious extremism . 
One concerns how states emerge from years of repression to build institutions capable of responding to the needs of the modern world . 
Another - plainly linked - is Muslim-majority countries &quot; efforts to define the relationship between religion and politics . 
The entire world has a massive interest in where these threads lead .
