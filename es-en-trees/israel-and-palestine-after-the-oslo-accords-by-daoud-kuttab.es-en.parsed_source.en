Israel and Palestine After Oslo 
RAMALLAH - On September 13 , 1993 , Shimon Peres and Mahmoud Abbas met on the South Lawn of the White House to sign the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles , or the Oslo Accords . 
PLO leader Yasir Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin then sealed the agreement with a historic handshake . 
The Oslo Accords - the result of secret talks that had been encouraged by the Norwegian government and conducted in the country &apos;s capital - called for a five-year transitional period during which Israeli forces would withdraw from the Gaza Strip and unspecified areas of the West Bank , and a Palestinian Authority would be established . 
Letters of recognition between the PLO and Israel accompanied the agreement . 
The ultimate aim , though never explicitly stated , was to create a Palestinian state roughly within the 1967 borders . 
But the goals laid out in the Oslo Accords remain unfulfilled . 
In fact , the agreement is unlikely to survive 89-year-old Peres and 77-year-old Abbas , who are now presidents of Israel and the Palestinian Authority , respectively . 
Several factors contributed to the deterioration of prospects for lasting peace . 
Perhaps the most important factor has been the continuation - and , at times , acceleration - of Israeli settlement activities in occupied Palestinian territories . 
Some Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza objected to the Accords &quot; failure to call explicitly for the end of illegal Israeli settlement building . 
But , 19 years later , the Washington-based Foundation for Middle East Peace reports that more Jewish settlements have been built in the occupied Palestinian territories since the Oslo Accords than before they were signed . 
As a result , the need for Israel to freeze settlement activities has become an international - not just a Palestinian - requirement for effective peace talks . 
Another crucial factor is continued violence . 
Since Rabin and Arafat shook hands , roughly 7,500 Palestinians and 1,400 Israelis have been killed , and many more have been injured or jailed . 
Israel &apos;s unilateral policy of demolishing homes in Palestine has resulted in scores of Palestinians being deported or made homeless in Jerusalem , Hebron , the Jordan Valley , and elsewhere . 
While killings have declined sharply in recent years , hardly a day passes without some form of violence , often against civilians - including children . 
Fueling this violence is growing hopelessness in the absence of a diplomatic agreement . 
While international leaders fill the airwaves with talk of peace , they have failed to address the conflict boldly and resolutely . For example , US President Barack Obama &apos;s election four years ago revived hope that negotiations would resume . 
But Obama &apos;s peace envoy , George Mitchell , resigned , and the quartet ( the United Nations , the European Union , Russia , and the United States ) was sidelined . 
Meanwhile , Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s conditional promise to support Palestinian statehood has been rendered meaningless by his government &apos;s provocative settlement policies in the areas that were supposed to comprise the Palestinian state . 
The Oslo Accords divided the occupied territories into three regions . 
Palestinians took charge of the most densely populated urban areas , while Israel maintained total military and administrative control over the largest territory , &quot; Area C , &quot; which makes up 61 % of the West Bank . 
Many Palestinians believe that this serves a long-term Zionist aim to keep the land without the people . 
Indeed , Israeli settlements have amounted to de facto Israeli annexation of territory into which Palestinians seek to expand their state . 
As a result , without a clear agreement on borders , Area C will witness the most serious confrontations . 
The Oslo Accords have also failed to put Palestinians on a path toward economic independence . 
According to the World Bank and other international agencies , slow and complicated bureaucratic and security processes , including hundreds of checkpoints , make Palestinian economic development impossible . 
Palestinian dependence on Israeli goods exacerbates the problem , as does Israeli control over the movement of goods and people to , within , and between the West Bank and the blockaded Gaza strip . 
The 1994 Paris Protocol , one of the most important annexes to the Oslo Accords , was intended to define economic relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority . 
The Protocol requires the Palestinian Authority to peg prices of certain goods and its rate of value-added tax to Israel &apos;s ; forces Palestinians to use Israel &apos;s currency ; and regulates customs procedures at border crossings with Jordan and Egypt . 
The Palestinian-Israeli conflict , now at least 45 years old , is not a complicated problem ; on the contrary , it can be summed up quite succinctly : to paraphrase the American political operative James Carville , &quot; It &apos;s the occupation , stupid . &quot; 
Eventually , Abbas will gain the UN General Assembly &apos;s acceptance of Palestinian statehood - his final accomplishment before leaving politics , as he has confided to his top aides . 
After his departure , Israel will miss his firm opposition to violence and his support for security cooperation . 
The symbolic decision on statehood , followed by Abbas &apos;s exit , will mark the end of the process that began in Oslo , and that has been undermining Palestinian aspirations for nearly two decades . 
With the Oslo Process now clearly dead , two options remain : chaos , extremism , and violence , or a new peace process - ideally one that can end the occupation and allow for Palestinian independence and freedom alongside a safe and secure Israel .
