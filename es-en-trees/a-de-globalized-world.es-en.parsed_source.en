A De-Globalized World ? 
Cambridge - It may take a few months or a couple of years , but one way or another the United States and other advanced economies will eventually recover from today &apos;s crisis . 
The world economy , however , is unlikely to look the same . 
Even with the worst of the crisis over , we are likely to find ourselves in a somewhat de-globalized world , one in which international trade grows at a slower pace , there is less external finance , and rich countries &quot; appetite for running large current-account deficits is significantly diminished . 
Will this spell doom for developing countries ? 
Not necesarily . 
Growth in the developing world tends to come in three distinct variants . 
First comes growth driven by foreign borrowing . 
Second is growth as a by-product of commodity booms . 
Third is growth led by economic restructuring and diversification into new products . 
The first two models are at greater risk than the third . 
But we should not lose sleep over them , because they are flawed and ultimately unsustainable . 
What should be of greater concern is the potential plight of countries in the last group . 
These countries will need to undertake major changes in their policies to adjust to today &apos;s new realities . 
The first two growth models invariably come to a bad end . 
Foreign borrowing can enable consumers and governments to live beyond their means for a while , but reliance on foreign capital is an unwise strategy . 
The problem is not only that foreign capital flows can easily reverse direction , but also that they produce the wrong kind of growth , based on overvalued currencies and investments in non-traded goods and services , such as housing and construction . 
Growth driven by high commodity prices is also susceptible to busts , for similar reasons . Commodity prices tend to move in cycles . 
When they are high , they are apt to crowd out investments in manufactures and other , non-traditional tradables . 
Moreover , commodity booms frequently produce ugly politics in countries with weak institutions , leading to costly struggles for resource rents , which are rarely invested wisely . 
So it is no surprise that the countries that have produced steady , long-term growth during the last six decades are those that relied on a different strategy : promoting diversification into manufactured and other &quot; modern &quot; goods . 
By capturing a growing share of world markets for manufactures and other non-primary products , these countries increased their domestic employment opportunities in high-productivity activities . 
Their governments pursued not just good &quot; fundamentals &quot; ( e.g. , macroeconomic stability and an outward orientation ) , but also what might be called &quot; productivist &quot; policies : undervalued currencies , industrial policies , and financial controls . 
China exemplified this approach . 
Its growth was fueled by an extraordinarily rapid structural transformation towards an increasingly sophisticated set of industrial goods . 
In recent years , China also got hooked on a large trade surplus vis-Ã -vis the US - the counterpart of its undervalued currency . 
But it wasn &apos;t just China . 
Countries that had been growing rapidly in the run-up to the great crash of 2008 typically had trade surpluses ( or very small deficits ) . 
These countries did not want to be recipients of capital inflows , because they realized that this would wreak havoc with their need to maintain competitive currencies . 
It is now part of conventional wisdom that large external balances - typified by the bilateral US-China trade relationship - played a major contributing role in the great crash . 
Global macroeconomic stability requires that we avoid such large current-account imbalances in the future . 
But a return to high growth in developing countries requires that they resume their push into tradable goods and services . 
In the past , this push was accommodated by the willingness of the US and a few other developed nations to run large trade deficits . 
This is no longer a feasible strategy for large or middle-income developing countries . 
So , are the requirements of global macroeconomic stability and of growth for developing countries at odds with each other ? 
Will developing countries &quot; need to generate large increases in the supply of industrial products inevitably clash with the world &apos;s intolerance of trade imbalances ? 
There is in fact no inherent conflict , once we understand that what matters for growth in developing countries is not the size of their trade surpluses , nor even the volume of their exports . 
What matters is their output of modern industrial goods ( and services ) , which can expand without limit as long as domestic demand expands simultaneously . 
Maintaining an undervalued currency has the upside that it subsidizes the production of such goods ; but it also has the downside that it taxes domestic consumption - which is why it generates a trade surplus . 
By encouraging industrial production directly , it is possible to have the upside without the downside . 
There are many ways that this can be done , including reducing the cost of domestic inputs and services through targeted investments in infrastructure . 
Explicit industrial policies can be an even more potent instrument . 
The key point is that developing countries that are concerned about the competitiveness of their modern sectors can afford to allow their currencies to appreciate ( in real terms ) as long as they have access to alternative policies that promote industrial activities more directly . 
So the good news is that developing countries can continue to grow rapidly even if world trade slows in and there is reduced appetite for capital flows and trade imbalances . 
Their growth potential need not be severely affected as long as the implications of this new world for domestic and international policies are understood . 
One such implication is that developing countries will have to substitute real industrial policies for those that operate through the exchange rate . 
Another is that external policy actors ( for example , the World Trade Organization ) will have to be more tolerant of these policies as long as the effects on trade balances are neutralized through appropriate adjustments in the real exchange rate . 
Greater use of industrial policies is the price to be paid for a reduction of macroeconomic imbalances .
