France &apos;s Ghetto Economy 
The youngsters who are ravaging France realize that they don &apos;t have a future . 
That is why they are burning cars . 
Poor second-generation immigrants in France have no economic prospects for two main reasons . 
First , the economy is growing far too slowly . 
As in most of continental Europe , economic performance has been enormously disappointing over the last two decades . 
During the period from 1980 to 2000 , only two OECD countries , Germany and Greece , recorded slower growth in income per capita than France . 
Greece was hurt by the wars in the Balkans . 
What &apos;s France &apos;s excuse ? 
Second , whatever growth there is in France does not trickle down to the poor . 
Many young second-generation immigrants are virtually excluded from the labor market . Average unemployment has been stuck at around 10 % for several years - one of the highest rates in the OECD . 
But the unemployment rate is more than double among the young . 
Unemployment is high and concentrated amongst French minorities because of specific labor-market institutions . 
France has strict hiring and firing regulations that make it costly to dismiss workers and thus reduce job creation . 
Those with a job are protected , those without one are hurt . 
Moreover , salaries cannot fall below a legislated minimum wage , which is so high that the least productive and least skilled workers remain shut out of the labor market . 
Wages are set in centralized negotiations by monopolistic unions , and apply throughout the economy . 
These French social institutions are designed with a purpose : to protect the French labor market &apos;s &quot; insiders . &quot; 
Regular workers enjoy secure and well-paid jobs , with much leisure time and little stress , particularly in the public sector . 
The poor minorities that remain excluded are provided with some social assistance . 
The economic harm done by this corporatist social model is aggravated by widespread state intervention in all parts of the economy . 
Services are sheltered from competition , hindering both productivity growth and job creation in these sectors . 
Government intervention distorts the prices , leading to inefficient allocation of resources in areas such as healthcare , education , and agriculture . 
French civil servants , convinced that they can spot profit opportunities better than the market , engage in a proactive industrial policy with a variety of tools , including the retention of minority or controlling stakes in a number of large enterprises . 
All of this results in an economy that grows too little , where the weakest are condemned to a life of exclusion and are deprived of any opportunity for upward mobility . 
Why has France fallen into this trap ? 
Not only the myopic pursuit of insiders &quot; economic interests is to blame . 
France is also burdened by strongly held ideological convictions . 
According to opinion polls collected in many countries by the World Value Surveys in 1999-2000 , the French on average fear income inequality much more than citizens of other industrial countries . 
Compared to other countries at about the same level of development , France stands out as being highly suspicious of the benefits of competition ( only Belgium fares slightly worse in this regard ) . 
French political institutions also bear heavy responsibility . 
France is a stable democracy , and large majorities in Parliament often support its governments . 
Barriers to entry into the French political elite are exceptionally high . 
The current president , Jacques Chirac , was elected 10 years ago ; he was already in government in 1969 . 
His predecessor , Francois Mitterand , was elected president for the first time in 1981 , and made his first appearance in government in 1956 . 
France is also a heavily centralized State , were most civil servants are recruited from a close circle of policy advisers to the top politicians , often educated at the same institution . 
Little wonder that change occurs so seldom in France . 
To be sure , the corporatist welfare state is not the only causes of today &apos;s Gallic intifada . 
Violent riots by immigrants and ethnic minorities have taken place in other countries as well , from London to Los Angeles . 
Social assistance with no hope of individual improvement is not enough . 
It is time that France starts questioning its economic model . 
In a recent statement about the burning suburbs , Chirac declared : &quot; We will have to draw all the lessons from this crisis , when the time comes and order has been restored , and with a lot of courage and lucidity . &quot; 
But those lessons imply reforms that are more far-reaching than Chirac is ever likely to envisage .
