Encouraging Work 
SANTIAGO - Some policies are economically illiterate , for they cause avoidable inefficiency . 
Others are heartless , for they cause avoidable human suffering . 
Few policies manage to be economically illiterate and heartless all at once . 
The system , introduced in 2003 by a Labour government , is modeled after the United States &quot; Earned Income Tax Credit . 
Both work in practice like a wage subsidy for those with low incomes , cutting poverty - particularly among women with young children - while strengthening incentives to work . 
Success has attracted emulators . 
Turkey adopted regionally targeted employment subsidies in 2004-2005 . 
When I was Chile &apos;s finance minister , our center-left government adopted a wage subsidy in 2008 , focused on young workers . 
South Africa &apos;s government did much the same in 2014 . 
The Tory move in the United Kingdom is based on shortsighted fiscal calculations ( appearing to shave additional pounds from the budget deficit ) and shortsighted political calculations ( displaying &quot; toughness &quot; to right-wing voters who believe that the poor are undeserving ) . 
But the move is also interesting in terms of what it reveals about the coming debate on the role of work ( and of labor-market policies ) in both advanced and emerging economies . 
Two forces are shaping this debate . 
The first is technological change . 
After globalization made it easier to move manufacturing and service jobs from rich to poor countries , growing automation now threatens to move jobs from humans to robots . 
A recent paper by two Oxford University economists estimates that up to 47 % of all jobs in the US are at risk . 
Techno-optimists like venture capitalist Peter Thiel point out that machines consume little ( beyond electricity ) while allowing us to produce vastly more , so their effects on human welfare must be unambiguously positive . 
Techno-pessimists like Robert Skidelsky fear that machines will wipe out so many jobs that governments will be forced to provide an income to all citizens . 
Neither is right . 
Fears about job losses arising from technological progress are not new . 
Inventions like the steam engine and the power loom destroyed some jobs but eventually created many more . 
But there are caveats . 
One is that adjustment is lengthy , because old jobs go quickly but new ones can take a long time to replace them . 
Public policies are needed both to accelerate the process and to alleviate human suffering . 
Another caveat is that technological change may worsen the income distribution if the jobs that are destroyed are those filled by unskilled workers . 
Less demand for their services will cause their relative ( and perhaps absolute ) wages to drop , causing income inequality to rise . 
Again , activist policy is called for , and here schemes like wage subsidies can play a key role . 
Unfortunately , the acrimonious politics surrounding today &apos;s jobs debate makes crafting the right policy response difficult . 
In rich countries , the stagnation of middle-class wages has caused understandable anxiety . 
Politicians like Hillary Clinton in the United States are promising that they can cajole large corporations into paying higher wages . 
They have the backing of luminaries like the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman , who , building on the pioneering work of economists David Card and Alan Krueger , argues that raising the minimum wage need not destroy a lot of jobs ( as conservative opponents insist ) - and may even create some . 
( Paradoxically , British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne seems to agree with these left-leaning American Democrats : He offered a minimum-wage increase as partial compensation for cutting wage subsidies . ) 
Politics is heating up in middle-income countries as well , and unions are pressing politicians to take action . 
Consider Chile , where the current leftist government has sent a bill to Congress that promises to improve income distribution simply by giving unions more power in collective bargaining . 
The aims are lofty , but the proposed policies alone will not solve the problem . 
Limited minimum-wage increases in a growing economy need not cost jobs ; but sizeable increases in a context of slumping growth ( the norm nearly everywhere today ) surely will . 
And automation will make it easier to substitute machines for workers , likely undermining the low elasticity of labor demand with respect to the cost of hiring ( adjusted to include turnover and training costs ) that underlies the Card-Krueger-Krugman view . 
Similarly , the potential for union-led bargaining to redistribute income presupposes non-competitive corporate practices , which in turn generate abnormal profits that can be bargained away by unions . 
But globalization and technological progress , by making it easier to match supply and demand , will make such monopolistic behavior harder to maintain in the future . 
Moreover , traditional redistribution policies presuppose traditional , contract-bound workers . 
That , too , can no longer be taken for granted . 
Are Uber drivers Uber employees ? 
The debate is raging in cities from Paris to San Francisco , and one can be sure that similar controversies will erupt in many more cities and countries - and not just over Uber . 
We are accustomed to the idea that owners of capital hire laborers and set the rules . 
In the future , technology may enable laborers to hire the capital they need and work with an unprecedented degree of autonomy . 
Distributional struggles will look very different in that kind of world . 
Last month , I attended a conference in France entitled &quot; What if work were the key ? &quot; 
The attendees also agreed that the best way to improve income distribution is to provide work to those who have no job ( and therefore no income ) . 
One figure mentioned at the conference stuck out : Out of today &apos;s five billion working-age people , only three billion have jobs . 
Solving that problem will require fresher thinking than experts and politicians have provided so far . 
Osborne and the British Tories got it completely wrong . 
Others should ignore their example .
