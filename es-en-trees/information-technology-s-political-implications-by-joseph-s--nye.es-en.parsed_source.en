The Information Revolution Gets Political 
NEW DELHI - The second anniversary of the &quot; Arab Spring &quot; in Egypt was marked by riots in Tahrir Square that made many observers fear that their optimistic projections in 2011 had been dashed . 
Part of the problem is that expectations had been distorted by a metaphor that described events in short-run terms . 
If , instead of &quot; Arab Spring , &quot; we had spoken of &quot; Arab revolutions , &quot; we might have had more realistic expectations . 
Consider the French Revolution , which began in 1789 . 
Who would have predicted that within a decade , an obscure Corsican soldier would lead French armies to the banks of the Nile , or that the Napoleonic Wars would disrupt Europe until 1815 ? 
If we think of the Arab revolutions , there are many surprises yet to come . 
So far , most Arab monarchies have had enough legitimacy , money , and force to survive the waves of popular revolt that have brought down secular republican autocrats like Egypt &apos;s Hosni Mubarak and Libya &apos;s Muammar el-Qaddafi , but we are only two years into the revolutionary process . 
Beneath the Arab political revolutions lies a deeper and longer process of radical change that is sometimes called the information revolution . 
We cannot yet fully grasp its implications , but it is fundamentally transforming the nature of power in the twenty-first century , in which all states exist in an environment that even the most powerful authorities cannot control as they did in the past . 
Governments have always worried about the flow and control of information , and our age is hardly the first to be strongly affected by dramatic changes in information technology . 
Gutenberg &apos;s printing press was important to the origins of the Protestant Reformation and the ensuing wars in Europe . 
Today , however , a much larger part of the population , both within and among countries , has access to the power that comes from information . 
The current global revolution is based on rapid technological advances that have dramatically decreased the cost of creating , finding , and transmitting information . 
Computing power doubled roughly every 18 months for 30 years , and , by the beginning of the twenty-first century , it cost one-thousandth of what it did in the early 1970 &quot; s . 
If the price of automobiles had fallen as quickly as the price of semiconductors , a car today would cost $ 5 . 
As recently as the 1980 &quot; s , phone calls over copper wire could carry only one page of information per second ; today , a thin strand of optical fiber can transmit 90,000 volumes in a second . 
In 1980 , a gigabyte of data storage occupied a room ; now , 200 gigabytes of storage fits in your shirt pocket . 
Even more crucial has been the enormous drop in the cost of transmitting information , which reduces barriers to entry . 
Power over information is much more widely distributed today than even a few decades ago . 
As a result , world politics is no longer the sole province of governments . 
Individuals and private organizations - including WikiLeaks , multinational corporations , NGOs , terrorists , or spontaneous social movements - have been empowered to play a direct role . 
The spread of information means that informal networks are undercutting the monopoly of traditional bureaucracy , with all governments less able to control their agendas . 
Political leaders enjoy fewer degrees of freedom before they must respond to events , and must then communicate not only with other governments , but with civil society as well . 
But it would be a mistake to &quot; over-learn &quot; the lessons that the Arab revolutions have taught about information , technology , and power . 
While the information revolution could , in principle , reduce large states &quot; power and increase that of small states and non-state actors , politics and power are more complex than such technological determinism implies . 
In the middle of the twentieth century , people feared that computers and new means of communications would create the kind of central governmental control dramatized in George Orwell &apos;s 1984 . 
And , indeed , authoritarian governments in China , Saudi Arabia , and elsewhere have used the new technologies to try to control information . 
Ironically for cyber-utopians , the electronic trails created by social networks like Twitter and Facebook sometimes make the job of the secret police easier . 
After its initial embarrassment by Twitter in 2009 , the Iranian government was able to suppress the country &apos;s &quot; green &quot; movement in 2010 . 
Similarly , while the &quot; great firewall of China &quot; is far from perfect , the government has managed thus far to cope , even as the Internet has burgeoned in the country . 
In other words , some aspects of the information revolution help the small , but some help the already large and powerful . 
Size still matters . 
While a hacker and a government can both create information and exploit the Internet , it matters for many purposes that large governments can deploy tens of thousands of trained people and have access to vast computing power to crack codes or intrude into other organizations . 
Likewise , while it is now cheap to disseminate existing information , the collection and production of new information often requires major investment , and , in many competitive situations , new information matters most . 
Intelligence collection is a good example , and the elaborate Stuxnet worm that disabled Iranian nuclear centrifuges seems to have been a government creation . 
Governments and large states still have more resources than information-empowered private actors , but the stage on which they play is more crowded . 
How will the ensuing drama unfold ? 
Who will win , and who will lose ? 
It will take decades , not a single season , to answer such questions . 
As events in Egypt and elsewhere have shown , we are only just beginning to comprehend the effects of the information revolution on power in this century .
