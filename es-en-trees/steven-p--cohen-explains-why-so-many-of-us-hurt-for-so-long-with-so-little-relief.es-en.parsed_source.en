A World of Pain 
BALTIMORE - Pain is ubiquitous in life . 
Inextricably bound to consciousness , it is an experience that all living creatures with advanced nervous systems share . 
For our ancestors , whose lives were fraught with danger , pain conferred an evolutionary advantage , signaling the need to separate oneself from its immediate source . 
But evolution has failed to keep pace with biomedical and technological advances , allowing chronic pain ( pain that persists beyond an acute injury or condition ) to become a disease in itself . 
It is difficult to overestimate chronic pain &apos;s societal impact . 
According to the US Institute of Medicine , one in three people suffer from chronic pain - more than from heart disease , cancer , and diabetes combined . 
Pain is the leading cause of disability , especially back pain among people under 45 years of age and joint pain in older individuals . 
In the United States alone , chronic pain is estimated to cost more than $ 600 billion annually . 
Pain can be classified according to a variety of factors , such as duration or location . 
But the most useful categorization is based on mechanism . 
Nociceptive pain , which arises from damage to non-nervous tissue , occurs when , say , a person twists an ankle . 
An example of chronic nociceptive pain is arthritis . 
Neuropathic pain , by contrast , arises after a lesion or disease affects the nervous system . 
Nerve damage resulting from diabetes ( diabetic neuropathy ) and persistent pain after shingles ( postherpetic neuralgia ) are among the most common causes . 
Chronic pain is difficult to treat ; even the most effective medications provide only modest relief to a minority of patients . 
This can be explained partly by pain &apos;s subjective nature , and partly by the fact that its source can be difficult to pinpoint . 
Although neuroscientists are adept at studying pain , animal models fail to account for its &quot; affective-motivational &quot; component - that is , pain &apos;s emotional , cognitive , and contextual features . 
Indeed , physiological indicators have less of an impact on a patient &apos;s prognosis after a painful injury than psychological and social factors such as depression or poor coping skills . 
The problem is that subjective measures are much more difficult to study - not least because they are associated with high placebo response rates . 
Unrealistic expectations exacerbate these psychological impediments to progress . 
In an era of instant access , people often expect immediate relief from symptoms , which is difficult to achieve when it comes to chronic pain . 
For example , the best way to relieve back and neck pain is often to exercise , while treating underlying contributing factors like obesity . 
But few people are willing to devote the time and effort that such a therapeutic plan demands ; they would prefer an injection , operation , or medication . 
When there is no instant fix available , they can become discouraged , hampering their recovery further . 
Making matters worse , people are being inundated with information - and often misinformation - through television , the Internet , and other direct-marketing channels . 
This fuels misconceptions and , in many cases , gives people false hope about the kind of relief they can expect from a particular drug or treatment . 
Not even physicians are immune to these influences ; indeed , in some cases , they actually create the bias . 
For example , studies of epidural steroid injections for back pain have been shown to be almost three times more likely to yield positive results when conducted by doctors who routinely administer them . 
Financial incentives have compounded the problem , leading to some alarming trends . 
Procedures , operations , and prescription opioid use aimed at curbing chronic pain have increased dramatically over the last decade , driving up health-care costs , while failing to stem the increase in the prevalence of pain or the number of disability claims . 
This is particularly problematic in countries where health-care delivery is based on a fee-for-service model . 
The rate of spine surgery in the United States , for example , is more than twice as high as in Europe . 
And , despite having less than 5 % of the world &apos;s population , the US accounts for more than three-quarters of global opioid consumption - leading to a surge in addiction rates and overdoses . 
What can be done to improve management and treatment of chronic pain ? 
For starters , health-care providers and individuals should view chronic pain more as a &quot; syndrome &quot; than a symptom - one that may not be &quot; curable . &quot; 
For patients who have not responded to conventional treatment , restoring function should replace eradicating pain as the primary objective . 
Similarly , patients must recognize that there are no &quot; silver bullets &quot; for pain treatment . 
Indiscriminate use of procedures that may benefit only a select few patients merely drives up health-care costs . 
Likewise , for chronic non-cancer pain , there is virtually no evidence to support the long-term use of high doses of opioids , which often do more harm than good . 
The long-term pain treatment with the strongest empirical support involves lifestyle modifications such as exercise , stress reduction , and weight loss - all of which require significant time and effort . 
Finally , researchers should compare the long-term cost-effectiveness of different treatments in typical chronic-pain patients . 
Such an approach would be more relevant and generalizable than industry-sponsored short-term studies that compare new treatments to placebos in a fastidiously chosen population that does not reflect real-world conditions . 
A thorough and realistic understanding of the nature of chronic pain is crucial to devising effective treatments . 
Indeed , without better evidence , efforts to help patients may well end up creating more problems than they solve .
