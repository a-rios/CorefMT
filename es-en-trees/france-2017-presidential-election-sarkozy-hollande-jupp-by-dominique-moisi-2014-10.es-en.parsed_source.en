The Resistible Return of Nicolas Sarkozy 
PARIS - Former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson once said that a week is a very long time in politics . 
If that is true , France &apos;s 2017 presidential election is an eternity away , and any speculation at this point is premature , even imprudent . 
Nonetheless , some interesting preliminary developments merit consideration - specifically those concerning perceptions of President François Hollande and his predecessor , Nicolas Sarkozy , neither of whom would be likely to win an election today . 
The French electorate &apos;s disapproval is among the only things that Hollande and Sarkozy - two men with strikingly different personalities and approaches - have in common . 
In fact , Hollande was elected in 2012 precisely because he presented himself as the &quot; anti-Sarkozy . &quot; 
Today , a significant majority of French voters cannot stomach the prospect of seeing either leader on their television screens for five more years ( the duration of a French presidential mandate ) . 
Both Hollande and Sarkozy have been relegated to the category of &quot; unwanted incumbent . &quot; 
Some might blame France &apos;s rejection of Hollande and Sarkozy on the challenges facing Europe today . 
Given rampant distrust of politicians and widespread frustration with the state of the economy , it would be difficult for any leader - except perhaps in Germany - to campaign successfully for reelection . 
But this explanation fails to account for those political figures - such as Sarkozy &apos;s predecessor , Jacques Chirac , and former Prime Minister Alain Juppé - who are popular precisely because of their experience . 
Indeed , while only 20 % of the French electorate view Hollande favorably , and nearly two-thirds of them do not want to see Sarkozy return to the Elysée Palace , more than two-thirds hope that Juppé will play an important political role in coming years . 
That makes the 69-year-old Juppé , who has announced his intention to run in 2017 , the country &apos;s most popular political figure . 
Nonetheless , Sarkozy appears convinced that , despite his inglorious departure from the presidency ( not to mention the ongoing corruption investigation against him ) , he can recapture the approval level enjoyed by Juppé , who , like Sarkozy , is affiliated with the Union for a Popular Movement ( UMP ) . 
Sarkozy , who has never stopped viewing himself as the savior that France urgently needs , seems to believe that Hollande &apos;s plummeting popularity must mean that his fellow citizens are ready for his return to the center stage . 
What Sarkozy has failed to grasp is that the reasons for his loss to Hollande in 2012 - such as his extreme nervousness and apparent untrustworthiness - are not only still relevant ; they have been compounded by an evident desire for revenge . 
And there is little that he can do to diminish the salience of that . 
Few voters seem to care about Sarkozy &apos;s quick and determined response to the 2007 global financial crisis . 
In politics , what you do matters less than how you are perceived . 
Just as public perceptions are undermining Sarkozy &apos;s political prospects , they are fueling Juppé &quot; s irresistible rise . 
Though Juppé , like Sarkozy , is no stranger to scandal - he was temporarily barred from public office for abuse of public funds during Chirac &apos;s tenure as mayor of Paris - his age is reassuring to French voters , who consider him wiser and mellower now ( he was also widely viewed as Chirac &apos;s scapegoat ) . 
Indeed , as the very successful mayor of Bordeaux , Juppé - unlike Hollande and Sarkozy - seems at ease with himself , both personally and politically . 
Moreover , if Juppé makes good on his promise to seek only one term , he would be able to focus on badly needed - but not necessarily popular - reforms , without fear of losing the next election . 
But there is one more factor fueling Juppé &quot; s popularity : the specter of the socially conservative , economically protectionist National Front , which is trying to capitalize on widespread rejection of the French political establishment to consolidate its political foothold . 
Juppé &quot; s firmly center-right stance provides a reliable alternative , even if he is deeply pro-European . 
Against this background , while Sarkozy may well become the UMP &apos;s president in November , when the post is contested at a special party congress , his selection as the UMP &apos;s presidential candidate is far from assured , given the resurrection of Juppé . 
At this point , the public-opinion gap between Sarkozy and Juppé is only widening . 
It is far too early to say who will be the next president of France .
