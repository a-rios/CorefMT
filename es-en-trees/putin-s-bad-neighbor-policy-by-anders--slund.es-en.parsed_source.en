Putin &apos;s Bad-Neighbor Policy 
WASHINGTON , DC - Russia has shown itself to be an international spoiler with its ardent support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . 
The contrast with its benign policy toward Libya in 2011 reflects how Russian foreign policy changed with the return of Vladimir Putin to the Kremlin . 
Russia has resumed its aggressive anti-American policy of 2007-2008 , which culminated in war with Georgia in August 2008 . 
Ironically , this bellicosity harms Russia the most , because it alienates all but international pariahs , such as Syria , Venezuela , and Belarus . 
Even in the former Soviet Union , almost all countries are seeking trade and security with anyone but Russia , because Putin is using all sticks and no carrots . 
His three main policy instruments toward the post-Soviet states are the customs union implied by his proposed &quot; Eurasian Union , &quot; Gazprom , and the Collective Security Treaty Organization ( CSTO ) . 
Each intimidates Russia &apos;s neighbors , while none benefits them , leaving them with few reasons to cooperate with Russia . 
Currently , Putin &apos;s top priority is to persuade as many countries as possible to join the customs union , but so far only Belarus and Kazakhstan have done so . 
Belarus set a high price , demanding a bailout of no less than $ 20 billion last year , while geography condemns Kazakhstan to get along with Russia . 
But the other post-Soviet countries resist , because a customs union with Russia would force them to raise their import tariffs , hindering their trade with other countries . 
If Russia were serious about economic integration , it would promote free-trade agreements to facilitate trade in all directions . 
In fact , in October 2011 , Russia initiated such a new multilateral free-trade agreement in the post-Soviet space ; but , owing to the Kremlin &apos;s single-minded pursuit of the customs union , only Belarus and Ukraine have ratified it , leaving its relevance in doubt . 
The Central Asian countries &quot; opposition to a customs union with Russia reflects their growing trade with China . 
In Europe , Moldova , Ukraine , and the Caucasian countries prefer free-trade agreements with the European Union , which the customs union would preempt . 
Meanwhile , Gazprom , one of Russia &apos;s key foreign-policy instruments , is probably the world &apos;s most mismanaged corporation . 
Last year , investment bankers assessed its losses through waste and corruption at no less than $ 40 billion - a level of misconduct that has driven its stock price to rock bottom . 
Gazprom &apos;s policy is to threaten client countries with high prices and stop deliveries until it gains full control over a country &apos;s gas-pipeline system . 
Putin has ruled the company with a firm hand as both President and Prime Minister . 
The mismanagement is not merely financial . 
In early 2009 , when Gazprom could not sell all of its gas to Europe because of the Great Recession , it sought to cut its supplies from Central Asia . 
After the Turkmen repaired the pipeline , Gazprom reneged on the old price . 
As a result , Russia has lost its access to cheap Central Asian gas , as well as to the Chinese market . 
Gazprom has pursued its most public fight with Ukraine , insisting on prices that are 50 % higher than what its EU customers pay . 
In addition , Gazprom is increasingly diverting gas transported through Ukraine to Europe to its new Nord Stream pipeline , with plans to circumvent the country further when the proposed South Stream is completed in 2015 . 
The current Ukrainian government would happily hand over half of its pipeline system to Gazprom in exchange for a lower gas price , but Putin demands that Ukraine also join the customs union . 
In July , Putin went to Ukraine to discuss these issues with President Viktor Yanukovych . 
On his way to the Crimea , however , Putin encountered a notorious Russian nationalist motorcycle gang , whose members demand that the Crimea be transferred to Russia . 
Putin spent so much time with the bikers that he arrived four hours late to his meeting with Yanukovych , which was then cut to 20 minutes . 
Putin added insult to injury by talking to his associates rather than to Yanukovych . 
Under these circumstances , not even Yanukovych , who governs in a Putinesque manner , can be pro-Russian . 
Since Putin offers Ukraine nothing , Ukraine has minimized its purchases of gas from Russia and downgraded all other bilateral relations . 
Moldova is in a similar predicament . 
Although it surrendered control of its gas pipelines to Gazprom , it is still charged a usurious price in the face of Russian demands that it , too , join the customs union . 
Little surprise that Moldova , one of the most democratic post-Soviet states , wants a free-trade agreement with the EU to escape the vagaries of Putin &apos;s policy . 
Since 1992 , Russia has tried to build its other main foreign-policy tool , the CSTO , as an alternative to NATO , but for years it had only six members - Russia and its closest allies , Belarus and Kazakhstan , plus three poor and insecure states ( Armenia , Kyrgyzstan , and Tajikistan ) . 
In 2006 , the Kremlin persuaded Uzbekistan to join , but , after Putin visited Tashkent in early June , President Islam Karimov suspended his country &apos;s membership . 
The CSTO remains a paper alliance without military significance . 
The happiest former Soviet countries are Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania , all of which minimized their contacts with Russia in 1992 and joined both the EU and NATO in 2004 . 
After its war with Russia in 2008 , Georgia decided to leave the Russian-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States . 
Azerbaijan , Turkmenistan , and Uzbekistan regularly boycott the CIS &apos;s meaningless annual summits . 
For how long will they bother to remain members ? 
Kremlin policy in the post-Soviet space makes little sense , because Russia gains nothing . 
Presumably , Putin hopes to whip up nationalist sentiment to strengthen his weakened hold on power at home . 
The problem for him is that , increasingly , Russians are not fooled .
