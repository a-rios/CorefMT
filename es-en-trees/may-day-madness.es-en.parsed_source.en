May Day Madness 
May 1 , 2006 , is a crucial date for Europe , for it is the deadline for implementing the European Union &apos;s directive on freedom of movement into national law . 
Most countries have already changed their immigration laws , or have promised to do so before the deadline . 
Only Belgium , Italy , Finland , and Luxemburg lag behind . 
True , some of the old EU countries have opted for a prohibition of labor migration during a transition period that is initially set at two years and may be extended to April 2011 . 
However , this prohibition does not apply to people who are self-employed or not working . 
Such people already enjoy full freedom of free migration today . 
While the directive &apos;s rules governing migration of employed and self-employed people hardly differ from previous EU law , the migration and social-welfare rights of non-working EU citizens have been significantly extended . 
According to the directive , every EU citizen has the right to a residence permit for up to five years in any member state , followed by the right to permanent residence . 
In principle , even inactive immigrants will then be eligible for social-welfare benefits , just like nationals . 
The directive contains safeguards to limit potential abuse of welfare-state benefits during the first five years , including proof of health insurance coverage and a requirement that sufficient &quot; resources &quot; be shown when a residence permit of up to five years is requested . 
But it is not clear what these resources are meant to be . 
According to the directive &apos;s preamble , the state cannot cite insufficient assets as a reason to refuse a residence permit , as this would be inadmissible discrimination . 
In theory , the resource requirement must be tailored to the individual circumstances of the immigrant . 
In practice , however , financial means in the form of assets or regular income are uniformly required from all immigrants , regardless of their individual characteristics . 
Nevertheless , even during the five-year period , an immigrant will enjoy greater rights . 
If he becomes indigent after receiving a residence permit , he cannot automatically be returned to his home country , as was possible before . 
Instead , the welfare state must make its services available to him . 
Only &quot; unreasonable &quot; claims may be refused , but the state will bear the burden of proving unreasonableness . 
Nor can the duration of the residence permit be shortened simply because the immigrant claims welfare assistance . 
When the five years of legal residence are completed , an immigrant automatically gains the inalienable right to permanent residence . 
The host country cannot deny this right even if an immigrant has no health insurance and no resources to live on . 
The immigrant will be fully eligible for all benefits the host country offers its domestic residents . 
The incentives to make use of the new directive will be especially strong for East Europeans . 
Today , average nominal wages in the eight post-communist EU countries are about one-fifth of the West European level and often only a quarter to a half of Western levels of social assistance . 
The real differences in living standards are not quite as large , but they are a temptation nonetheless . 
This will be particularly true for Bulgarians and Rumanians , who are invited to join the EU in 2007 . 
Currently their nominal wages are only about 7 % of the West European average . 
Western Europe has already experienced three decades of indirect migration into the welfare state , as social benefits have created artificially high wages for the unskilled , simultaneously fueling excessive immigration and unemployment . 
Immigrants have crowded out domestic residents who prefer the benefits to engaging in low-wage competition with the newcomers . 
The directive on free movement implies a new era of direct migration into West European welfare states . 
The result may be an erosion of these welfare states themselves . 
As no West European state wants welfare immigration , and because they are unable to discriminate between nationals and EU immigrants , they will begin to reduce their services . 
Europe will enter an extended period of competitive deterrence , during which it will gradually abandon its old social values . 
To be sure , countervailing political forces will press for harmonization of Europe &apos;s social-welfare systems . 
The draft EU constitution , which failed in the French and Dutch referenda last year , breathes the spirit of this approach . 
Unfortunately , harmonization would probably apply to wage replacement payments , implying uniform minimum wage constraints for EU countries . 
Given the EU &apos;s economic heterogeneity , this outcome would likely boost unemployment . 
There is still time to avert these frightening effects . 
But , to do so , the directive on free movement must be changed , so that the right to immigrate does not automatically imply a right to social benefits . 
If the home country were to remain responsible for welfare services to non-working immigrants , the erosion of West European welfare states that the theory of systems competition predicts could be halted . 
But that would mean a substantial change in the direction of EU social policies , including revision of the draft constitution .
