Sorry is the Hardest Word 
CANBERRA - Apologies , or the lack of them , have been back in the news , raising questions again about how useful they are in resolving international problems . 
The efficacy of timely and sincere apologies in defusing personal tensions cannot be doubted . 
Is the same true for diplomacy ? 
In some recent cases , the issue has been not much more than an irritating sideshow , as when Afghan President Hamid Karzai demanded an apology from the United States late last year for causing unintended civilian deaths - at the price , bizarrely , of allowing the Americans to continue defending him and his country ( the US understandably refused ) . 
But in other cases , the stakes have become very high indeed . 
Bilateral relations between Indonesia and Australia since last November have become more frigid than they have been in decades , owing to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono &apos;s very real anger at Australia &apos;s refusal to offer an apology for tapping his private telephone ( and his wife &apos;s ) . 
And Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s visit in December to the Yasukuni Shrine , which honors Japan &apos;s war dead - including , since 1978 , its most serious convicted war criminals - has re-opened long-festering wounds among Japan &apos;s neighbors , who perceive a lack of sincere contrition for waging aggressive war and committing wartime atrocities . 
It has certainly added tension to Japan &apos;s already-fraught standoff with China over their competing claims to the Senkaku / Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea . 
In the case of Indonesia &apos;s reaction to former US intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden &apos;s revelations of Australian spying on its first family , a personal apology from Prime Minister Tony Abbott would have made all the difference . 
He had merely to follow the playbook of President Barack Obama &apos;s response to German Chancellor Angela Merkel when the US was similarly caught out . 
Had he coupled this with a simple promise to &quot; review our collection processes and priorities , &quot; there might even have been no need to pledge explicitly , as the US now has , to end all monitoring of &quot; the leaders of our close friends and allies . &quot; 
I was in Jakarta at the time , and formed that judgment after speaking to very senior officials , and I advised the Australian government accordingly . 
But the government took the view that when it comes to intelligence matters , apologies are for wimps . 
With elections looming in Indonesia , and nationalist sentiment there strong , Australia will be paying the diplomatic price for a long time unless it changes course . 
The case of Japan is more complex . 
Under strong international pressure in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s - to which I hope I contributed as Australia &apos;s foreign minister - a series of powerful apologies were in fact offered . 
Notable among them was then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono &apos;s statement in 1993 on the issue of Korea &apos;s &quot; comfort women , &quot; and Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama &apos;s expression , on the 50th anniversary of the end of the World War II , of &quot; deep remorse &quot; and &quot; heartfelt apology . &quot; 
There has been no subsequent outright disavowal of these apologies ; indeed , this month Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said that Abe &apos;s cabinet members &quot; have never denied &quot; the Kono and Murayama statements . 
But , save for a gracious acceptance by South Korea &apos;s then-President Kim Dae-jung in 1998 , Japan &apos;s apologies simply have not resonated much in the region , because they have regularly been accompanied by apparent side-stepping or backsliding . 
Japan &apos;s Diet , for example , failed to endorse Murayama &apos;s statement in 1995 , agreeing only to express &quot; a deep feeling of remorse &quot; ( and even then 241 MPs abstained ) . 
Above all , there have been Japanese leaders &quot; recurring pilgrimages to Yasukuni . 
The shrine not only records war criminals in its &quot; Book of Souls &quot; ; it also contains the Yushukan museum , where Japan &apos;s conquests in the 1930 &quot; s and 1940 &quot; s are glorified as &quot; just wars fought for survival and self-defense &quot; or for the &quot; liberation of Asia . &quot; 
Certainly some of the outraged reaction by Japan &apos;s neighbors is of questionable sincerity . 
South Koreans have often failed to acknowledge the number and intensity of statements about comfort women ( who were forced to provide sexual services to Japanese soldiers ) and the amount of compensation on offer . 
China , for its part , periodically mobilizes nationalist sentiment to divert attention from internal problems , and partly encouraged Abe &apos;s recent assertiveness by declaring an Air Defense Identification Zone beyond its acknowledged national airspace in the East China Sea - a move that , while not illegal , was certainly provocative . 
But Japan could and should have done much more to give real substance to its apologies , as the Germans have done . 
At least since 1970 , Germany has taken a comprehensive and credible approach to atoning for its Nazi past , fully acknowledging its horrors in school curricula , graphically commemorating them in museums , monuments , and ceremonies , and employing official discourse that has been unfailingly contrite . 
Harvard &apos;s Ezra Vogel , while not sparing China from his prescriptions , recently mapped some strategies by which Japan could defuse historical issues . 
Vogel recommends a full and objective official account of the suffering Japan &apos;s military aggression caused , lengthening the time that students must devote to modern Japanese history , and including regional reactions and criticism in that study . 
Diplomats can learn from examples of transformative national apologies . 
The reconciliation of indigenous and white Australians was hugely advanced by Prime Minister Paul Keating &apos;s Redfern speech in 1992 , in which he declared : &quot; We committed the murders . 
We practiced discrimination and exclusion . 
It was our ignorance and our prejudice ... &quot; 
Likewise , former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd offered a strong apology in 2008 to the &quot; stolen generations &quot; of Aboriginal children taken from their families by welfare officers . 
There are many situations in which apologies are not necessary , because both sides agree to move on . 
And &quot; non-apology apologies &quot; - for example , &quot; I &apos;m sorry if you feel I have offended you &quot; - are often worse than nothing , although they are a familiar diplomatic stock-in-trade of which I , too , have been guilty of using . 
It is also conceivable that genuine apologies may be counterproductive , because they trigger a backlash from local extremists , which may in turn fuel even more flames on the other side . 
I would , however , resist the conclusion that Japan &apos;s apologies have been a net negative in this respect . 
These arguments will continue . 
But it is difficult to believe that when a wrong has been done , a sincere apology will not have some restorative impact . 
In public , as in private life , honest apologies are a powerful tool , and should be used less nervously and more often .
