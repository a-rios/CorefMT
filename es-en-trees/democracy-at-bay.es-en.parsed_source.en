Democracy at Bay 
Is the democratic tide reversing ? 
Little more than a decade ago , people spoke of the end of history , of the final , unchallengeable triumph of free markets and democracy . 
But public opinion in a number of countries now seems to be turning against democracy , argues Bronislaw Geremek , Poland &apos;s former foreign minister , and proposes ways in which this trend might be reversed . 
Eight of the countries that will enter the European Union in May 2004 were until recently governed by totalitarian dictatorships and enslaved by another nation . 
The return of governments based on the will of the majority of their citizens seemed for decades an unattainable dream in these countries , much as it remains a dream for the citizens of Burma under the rule of its military junta . 
Democracy has undoubtedly achieved success around the world . 
Yet , stunningly , support for democracy is eroding almost everywhere . 
The Pew Global Attitudes Project for 2003 highlights countries in which few people recognize the importance of elections : 28 % in Jordan , 37 % in Russia , 40 % in Indonesia . 
Given the choice between a democratic government and a strong leader , 70 % of Russians , 67 % of Ukrainians , and 44 % of Poles and Bulgarians opt for the latter . 
( This choice is especially common among people in the lowest income brackets ) . 
In Latin America , only in Venezuela is support for democracy unambiguously dominant ( 79 % ) . 
In other Latin American countries , support for a strong leader either is stronger or nearly as strong as support for democracy . 
An opinion poll in Israel shows that the majority of Israelis opt for democracy , but there is a downward trend there as well . 
Five years ago , 90 % of Israelis supported democracy ; today the number is 77 % . 
Suicide bombers , the prolonged state of tension , and the overall weakening of the hope for peace have slashed support for democratic government . 
In Asia , people in most countries still believe that a ¡ ° good democracy ¡ ± is more important than a ¡ ° strong economy . ¡ ± The opposite is true , however , in democratic Indonesia , where 69 % prefer a strong economy . 
Even in a number of European countries with old democratic traditions , a wave of populist , radical political parties opposed to minorities and immigrants has achieved success , sometimes even winning elections . 
In other European countries , which have only recently embarked on the democratic path , a truly stunning change of mood is visible . 
In Russia &apos;s recent parliamentary elections , which were - regardless of various reservations - conducted according to democratic standards , parties advocating political and economic freedom suffered painful defeat , while parties proclaiming hostility to the rule of law and modern pluralist democracy were successful . 
In December &apos;s parliamentary election in Serbia , the extreme nationalist Radical Party achieved the greatest success , and people being tried before the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague , such as Vojislav Seslj , the Radicals &apos; founder and long-time leader , and Slobodan Milosevic , were elected to parliament . 
These results demonstrate the grave dangers that young democracies face , as well as the fragility of democratic culture . 
They are also a failure of human beings : democratic values do not function without citizens ; there can be no democracy without democrats . 
This poses dramatic questions about the place of democratic values in international affairs , about the effectiveness of action in support of democracy , and about the way in which democracy is to be understood . 
Three sets of issues are worth noting . 
First , almost no one disputes the claim that democracy serves the cause of peace , but little is being done to make democracy - together with human rights - a basis of the international order . 
A step was made in this direction in June 2000 , when the Community of Democracy , bringing together more than half of the member states of the United Nations , was created in Warsaw . 
The creation of that body was an important step , because it introduced a set of criteria that must be fulfilled by countries that want to call themselves democratic . 
The organization promised to monitor the behavior of members and thus create a chance for coordinated support of the democratic order . 
It amounted to an agreement that the continuing absence of democracy in many parts of the world is a disgrace . 
Second , as the Pew poll suggests , today &apos;s weakening of democratic culture usually takes the form of nostalgia for strong leadership - a clear incitement to launching coups . 
The weapons of shame and international opprobrium should be mustered to make it impossible for any democratic nation to legitimize a coup in another democratic country . 
It should become a principle of international relations that democracy and democratization must be supported in all situations ; that democratic societies should forego any opportunistic benefits that may come from supporting the enemies of democracy . 
Third , democracy should not be reduced to mere respect for majority decisions . 
Nowadays , a more telling test of the vitality of a democracy is respect for the rights of minorities , recognition of the supremacy of the principles of the rule of law , and the acceptance of legal equality among citizens . 
Pericles , in his speech about democracy , as recorded by Thucydides , expressed a timely thought : ¡ ° Guided by tolerance in private life , we respect the law in public life ; we obey all laws , especially those unwritten ones , laws that defend those to whom injustice is being done , and laws the transgression of which brings universal disgrace . ¡ ± That ancient sense of the potent power of shame should be employed today , lest the democratic tide continue to run out .
