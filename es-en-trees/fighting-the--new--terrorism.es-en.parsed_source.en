Fighting the \ 
As the US presidential heats up , critics argue that President George W. Bush &apos;s war in Iraq has made the problem of combating terrorism worse . 
It is a serious charge , because the world needs a broader strategy against terrorism . 
Terrorism is nothing new , nor is it a single enemy . 
It is a longstanding method of conflict frequently defined as deliberate attack on the innocent with the objective of spreading fear . 
The attacks on New York and Washington of 2001 were dramatic escalations of an age-old phenomenon . 
Terrorism today , however , is different from what it was in the past . 
Nowadays , instruments of mass destruction are smaller , cheaper , and more readily available . 
Cellular phones were used as timers in the attacks in Madrid last March . 
Hijacking an airplane is relatively inexpensive . 
Finally , the information revolution provides inexpensive means of communication and organization that allow groups once restricted to local and national police jurisdictions to become global . 
Al Qaeda is said to have established a network in fifty or more countries . 
Changes have also occurred in the motivation and organization of terrorist groups . 
Terrorists in the mid-20th century tended to have relatively well-defined political objectives , which were often ill-served by mass murder . 
Governments supported many covertly . 
Toward the century &apos;s end , radical groups grew on the fringes of several religions . 
Most numerous were the tens of thousands of young Muslims who fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan , where they were trained in a wide range of techniques and many were recruited to organizations with an extreme view of the religious obligation of jihad . 
These technological and ideological trends increased both the lethality and the difficulty of managing terrorism . 
Because of the unprecedented scale of Al Qaeda &apos;s attacks , the focus is properly on Islamic extremists . 
But it would be a mistake to limit our concern solely to Islamic terrorists , for that would ignore the way that technology is putting into the hands of deviant groups and individuals &apos; destructive capabilities that were once limited primarily to governments and armies . 
Deviant individuals and groups exist in all human societies , and they are now empowered in ways that were once unthinkable . 
Think , for example of Timothy McVeigh , who bombed the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 , or the Aum Shinrykio cult that released poison gas in the Tokyo subway system the same year . 
Lethality has been increasing . 
In the 1970 &apos;s , the Palestinian attack on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics and attacks by groups like the Red Brigades galvanized world attention at the cost of dozens of lives . 
In the l980 &apos;s , the worst terrorist incident killed 300 people . 
The attacks on America of September 2001 cost several thousand lives . 
This escalation occurred without using weapons of mass destruction . 
If one imagines a deviant group in some society gaining access to biological or nuclear materials , it is possible terrorists could destroy millions of lives . 
To kill so many people in the 20th century , a Hitler or Stalin required the apparatus of a totalitarian government . 
It is now easy to envisage extremist groups and individuals killing millions without government help 
Politics has plagued efforts to agree on a common definition of terrorism at the United Nations . 
Some skeptics argue that one man &apos;s terrorist is another man &apos;s freedom fighter , and that treating suppression of terrorism as a global public good is thus merely the hypocrisy of the powerful trying to disarm the weak . 
That need not be the case . 
Not all struggles for national liberation turn to deliberate killing of innocents . 
Deliberate killing of non-combatants ( in war or not ) is condemned by most major religions , including Islam . 
Such behavior is unacceptable whether it is carried out by the powerful or the weak . 
While any definition of terrorism has problems at the margins , the core of terrorism is clear enough to permit efforts to de-legitimize it . 
Indeed , many countries are parties to UN conventions that commit them to combating aspects of terrorist behavior , even though the UN has not agreed on a single formal definition . 
Today , some states harbor terrorists in order to attack their enemies or because they are too weak to control powerful groups . 
If a campaign to suppress terrorism is based on broad coalitions that focus on de-legitimizing attacks on innocent non-combatants , it has some prospect of success . 
Indeed , one lesson of the efforts since 2001 is that there is no way to avoid broad cooperation . 
In that sense , the metaphor of war - with its emphasis on military force is - misleading . 
The metaphor of war was understandable in the aftermath of the 2001 attacks , but creates as many problems as it solves . 
How long will the war last and how does it relate to civil liberties and alliances ? 
Bombing is not an option for fighting terrorist cells in Hamburg , Singapore , or Detroit . 
Only close civilian cooperation in intelligence sharing , police work across borders , tracing financial flows , and working to pre-clear cargo manifests and passenger lists can cope with such a threat . 
Countries cooperate out of self-interest , but a country &apos;s soft or attractive power , not only its military might , affects the degree of cooperation . 
That is why critics argue that Bush &apos;s policy in Iraq was a mistake . 
It squandered American soft power , diverted attention from Afghanistan and Al Qaeda , and created a danger that Iraq may become a haven for terrorists . 
But critics of Bush at home and abroad must also realize that , notwithstanding past mistakes , pursuing a common strategy is essential , because terrorism is here to stay .
