Connectivity for All 
NEW YORK - It is not every day that one gets to join two global powerhouses to promote a planetary breakthrough , but that is the reality with Connect to Learn ( www.connecttolearn.org ) , a new worldwide initiative to ensure that all children on the planet can attain at least a secondary education . 
The telecommunications giant Ericsson and the pop singer Madonna are teaming up to get kids into school and connected worldwide through wireless broadband . 
My colleagues and I at the Earth Institute and the Millennium Promise Alliance are joining the effort . 
The stakes could not be higher - or the prospects more exciting . 
The information-and-communications-technology ( ICT ) revolution is surely the most powerful single force for economic development in the world today . 
It is not just in New York , Shanghai , or Paris that one finds a mobile telephone in the hands of each passerby . 
These days , one finds mobile phones in Nairobi taxis and among camel-herders in Northern Kenya . 
There are now 4.6 billion mobile subscribers , and the numbers are soaring . 
An estimated 250 million subscribers live in Sub-Saharan Africa alone . 
The spread of 3G ( and soon 4G ) offers the prospect of a technological breakthrough in education . 
Suddenly , even remote schools can connect to the Internet and to other schools through a solar panel , low-cost computers , and wireless access . 
A school that lacked even rudimentary supplies suddenly can have access to the same global store of information as any other place in the world . 
When it happens , the results are galvanizing . 
Within minutes of going online in a pastoralist community in northeast Kenya , kids were reading about their own community as part of the Africa-wide Millennium Villages Project . 
Communities that had little school attendance have seen kids stream in as low-cost interventions , starting with Internet connectivity , in-school meals , and a safe water supply , lead to a surge in schools &quot; quality , performance , and attractiveness to students and parents . 
With modest up-front financing , impoverished and traditional rural communities that had not considered educating girls suddenly see the immense value to the community of educating both boys and girls . 
In a Millennium Village in Ethiopia that I recently visited with the country &apos;s health minister , a local father explained to me how he had decided to keep his daughter in school rather than marrying her at age 12 to a neighbor &apos;s son . 
&quot; I asked my daughter what she wanted to do , &quot; the father explained , &quot; and she told me that she wants to stay in school , so she is continuing in school . &quot; 
The health minister turned to me and said that he had never before heard such a conversation in that region : that the father would not only ask the daughter , but happily heed her decision ! 
We are seeing such rapid changes throughout Africa . 
Impoverished communities are cheering the prospect of a rapid ramp-up in girls &quot; education , if meager resources permit . 
On a sunny day in Malawi recently , Madonna and the CEO of Ericsson , Hans Vestberg , attended the groundbreaking for a new girls &quot; school and launched the new global education initiative . 
On the horizon in two directions , spaced at around four kilometers , were the mobile towers to connect the new school with the world . 
The promise was not lost on the national government . 
The education minister committed to scale up education nationally as rapidly as resources would permit . 
Universal secondary education , especially for girls , is transformative for societies attempting to escape poverty , because education changes the demographic dynamics of the country as well . 
In the poorest parts of the world where girls are still not in secondary school , they are married at a young age and have 6-8 children on average . 
Those who stay in school end up marrying much later , perhaps in their early to mid-twenties , entering the workforce , and having 2-3 children . 
The interplay of voluntary fertility reduction and declining poverty are profound and rapid . 
When poor families have fewer children , they can afford to invest more per child in health , nutrition , and schooling . 
Mothers can spend more time in the job market , breaking long-standing barriers of gender inequality . 
Reduced population growth means less pressure on land , water , and biodiversity . 
In short , the links between education and reduced fertility , faster economic development , and lower environmental degradation are too powerful and obvious to be ignored . 
Connecting kids around the world in shared on-line curricula , and facilitating &quot; social networks &quot; of kids around the world at an early age , will yield far-reaching educational benefits . 
At a recent launch of a &quot; school-to-school &quot; link connecting an elementary school in the United States with one in Kenya , young children across an 8,000-mile divide shared a &quot; read-aloud , &quot; and then reflected in amazement and delight that they could share a story with kids in another part of the world . 
The Teachers College at Columbia University will watch the school-to-school process carefully , with formal monitoring methods , to assess the value of school experiences in terms of expanded cognitive and ethical learning . 
Current estimates suggest that around 300 million school-age children worldwide are deprived of the chance to complete secondary school , largely for economic reasons . 
That deficit , which threatens the futures of these kids and their societies , can now be closed at low cost . 
A Global Fund for Education , combined with a global voluntary effort to connect kids around the world , offers the chance for a breakthrough that was not realistic even a few years ago . 
Such initiatives are another dramatic example of a basic truth of our time : extreme poverty , illiteracy , and death from preventable diseases are anachronistic scourges when we have the technologies and global goodwill to end them .
