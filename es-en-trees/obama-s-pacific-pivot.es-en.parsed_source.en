Obama &apos;s Pacific Pivot 
CAMBRIDGE - Asia &apos;s return to the center of world affairs is the great power shift of the twenty-first century . 
In 1750 , Asia had roughly three-fifths of the world &apos;s population and accounted for three-fifths of global output . 
By 1900 , after the Industrial Revolution in Europe and America , Asia &apos;s share of global output had shrunk to one-fifth . 
By 2050 , Asia will be well on its way back to where it was 300 years earlier . 
But , rather than keeping an eye on that ball , the United States wasted the first decade of this century mired in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
Now , as US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it in a recent speech , American foreign policy will &quot; pivot &quot; toward East Asia . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s decision to rotate 2,500 US Marines through a base in northern Australia is an early sign of that pivot . 
In addition , the November Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting , held in Obama &apos;s home state of Hawaii , promoted a new set of trade talks called the Trans-Pacific Partnership . 
Both events reinforce Obama &apos;s message to the Asia-Pacific region that the US intends to remain an engaged power . 
The pivot toward Asia does not mean that other parts of the world are no longer important ; on the contrary , Europe , for example , has a much larger and richer economy than China &apos;s . 
But , as Obama &apos;s national security adviser , Tom Donilon , recently explained , US foreign policy over the past few years has been buffeted by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , concerns about terrorism , nuclear-proliferation threats in Iran and North Korea , and the recent Arab uprisings . 
Obama &apos;s November trip to Asia was an effort to align US foreign-policy priorities with the region &apos;s long-term importance . 
In Donilon &apos;s words , &quot; by elevating this dynamic region to one of our top strategic priorities , Obama is showing his determination not to let our ship of state be pushed off course by prevailing crises . &quot; 
The Obama administration also announced that , whatever the outcome of the defense-budget debates , &quot; we are going to make sure that we protect the capabilities that we need to maintain our presence in the Asia-Pacific &quot; region . 
Obama &apos;s November trip was also a message to China . 
After the 2008 financial crisis , many Chinese expressed the mistaken belief that the US was in terminal decline , and that China should be more assertive - particularly in pursuing its maritime claims in the South China Sea - at the expense of America &apos;s allies and friends . 
During Obama &apos;s first year in office , his administration placed a high priority on cooperation with China , but Chinese leaders seemed to misread US policy as a sign of weakness . 
The administration took a tougher line when Clinton addressed the South China Sea question at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Hanoi in July 2010 . 
Chinese President Hu Jintao &apos;s subsequent official visit to Washington in January 2011 was successful , but many Chinese editorialists complained that the US was trying to &quot; contain &quot; China and prevent its peaceful rise . 
China &apos;s anxiety about a supposed US containment policy is on the rise again , now that Clinton is insisting that the country &apos;s maritime disputes with its neighbors be placed on the agenda at next year &apos;s East Asia Summit in Manila , which will be attended by Obama , Hu Jintao , and other regional leaders . 
But American policy toward China is different from Cold War containment of the Soviet bloc . 
Whereas the US and the Soviet Union had limited trade and social contact , the US is China &apos;s largest overseas market , welcomed and facilitated China &apos;s entry into the World Trade Organization , and opens its universities &quot; gates to 125,000 Chinese students each year . 
If current US policy towards China is supposed to be Cold War-style containment , it seems unusually warm . 
The Pentagon &apos;s East Asia Strategy Review , which has guided American policy since 1995 , offered China integration into the international system through trade and exchange programs . 
Although the US hedged its bet by simultaneously strengthening its alliance with Japan , this does not constitute containment . 
After all , China &apos;s leaders cannot predict their successors &quot; intentions . 
The US is betting that they will be peaceful , but no one knows . 
A hedge expresses caution , not aggression . 
American military forces do not aspire to &quot; contain &quot; China in Cold War fashion , but they can help to shape the environment in which future Chinese leaders make their choices . 
I stand by my testimony before the US Congress of 1995 in response to those who , even then , wanted a policy of containment rather than engagement : &quot; Only China can contain China . &quot; 
If China becomes a bully in the Asia-Pacific region , other countries will join the US to confront it . 
Indeed , that is why many of China &apos;s neighbors have strengthened their ties with the US since 2008 , when China &apos;s foreign policy became more assertive . 
But the last thing the US wants is a Cold War II in Asia . 
Whatever the two sides &quot; competitive positions , Sino-American cooperation on issues like trade , financial stability , energy security , climate change , and pandemics will benefit both countries . 
The rest of the region stands to gain , too . 
The Obama administration &apos;s pivot towards Asia signals recognition of the region &apos;s great potential , not a clarion call for containment .
