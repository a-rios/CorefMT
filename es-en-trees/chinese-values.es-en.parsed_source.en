Chinese Values ? 
BERLIN - There can be little reasonable doubt today that the People &apos;s Republic of China will dominate the world of the twenty-first century . 
The country &apos;s rapid economic growth , strategic potential , huge internal market , and enormous investment in infrastructure , education , and research and development , as well as its massive military buildup , will see to that . 
This means that , in political and economic terms , we are entering an East and Southeast Asian century . 
Lest we forget , the outcome for the world would have been far worse if China &apos;s ascent had failed . 
We can foresee the power that will shape its geopolitics , but what values will underlie the exercise of that power ? 
The official policy of &quot; Four Modernizations &quot; ( industrial , agricultural , military , and scientific-technological ) that has underpinned China &apos;s rise since the late 1970 &quot; s has failed to provide an answer to that question , because the &quot; fifth modernization &quot; - the emergence of democracy and the rule of law - is still missing . 
Indeed , political modernization faces massive opposition from the Chinese Communist Party , which has no interest in surrendering its monopoly of power . 
Moreover , the transition to a pluralist system that channels , rather than suppresses , political conflict would indeed be risky , though the risk will grow the longer one-party rule ( and the endemic corruption that accompanies it ) persists . 
Ideologically , Chinese leadership &apos;s rejection of human rights , democracy , and the rule of law is based on the contention that these supposedly universal values are a mere stalking horse for Western interests , and that repudiating them should thus be viewed as a matter of self-respect . 
China will never again submit to the West militarily , so it should not submit to the West normatively either . 
And here we return to the concept of &quot; Asian values , &quot; originally developed in Singapore and Malaysia . 
Essentially , the concept has served to justify collectivist-authoritarian rule by aligning it with local tradition and culture , with autonomy defined in terms of otherness - that is , differentiation from the West and its values . 
Thus , &quot; Asian values &quot; are not universal norms , but rather a self-preservation strategy harnessed to identity politics . 
Given the history of Western colonialism in Asia , the desire to maintain a distinct identity is both legitimate and understandable , as is the belief in many Asian countries - first and foremost China - that the time has come to settle old scores . 
How that question is answered is crucially important , because it will determine the character of a global power , and thus how it deals with other , weaker countries . 
A state becomes a world power when its strategic significance and potential give it global reach . 
The world &apos;s acclimation to a global hegemonic structure - in which world powers guarantee an international order - survived the Cold War . 
The Soviet Union wasn &apos;t ideologically anti-Western , because Communism and Socialism were Western inventions , but it was anti-Western in political terms . 
And it failed not only for economic reasons , but also because its internal and external behavior was based on compulsion , not consent . 
By contrast , the United States &quot; economic and political model , and that of the West , with its individual rights and open society , proved to be its sharpest weapon in the Cold War . 
The US prevailed not because of its military superiority , but because of its soft power , and because its hegemony was based not on coercion ( though there was some of that , too ) , but largely on consent . 
Which path will China choose ? 
While China will not change its ancient and admirable civilization , it owes its re-emergence to its embrace of the contemporary Western model of modernization - the huge achievement of Deng Xiaoping , who put the country on its current path more than three decades ago . 
Clearly , national interests , and sometimes pure power , play a part in how the US and other Western countries apply values like human rights , the rule of law , democracy , and pluralism . 
They are indeed universal , and all the more so in an era of comprehensive globalization . 
The contribution of Asia - and of China , in particular - to the development of this universal set of values is not yet foreseeable , but it will surely come if the &quot; fifth modernization &quot; leads to China &apos;s political transformation . 
China &apos;s course as a world power will be determined to a significant extent by the way it confronts this question .
