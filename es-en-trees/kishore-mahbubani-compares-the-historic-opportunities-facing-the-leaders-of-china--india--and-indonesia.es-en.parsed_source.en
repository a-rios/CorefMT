Asia &apos;s Reform Trinity ? 
SINGAPORE - Asia is poised to enter a historical sweet spot , with three of its most populous countries - China , India , and Indonesia - led by strong , dynamic , and reform-minded leaders . 
In fact , China &apos;s Xi Jinping , India &apos;s Narendra Modi , and Indonesia &apos;s Joko &quot; Jokowi &quot; Widodo could end up ranked among their countries &quot; greatest modern leaders . 
In China , Mao Zedong united the country in 1949 , while Deng Xiaoping was responsible for engineering its unprecedented economic rise . 
For Xi to join their ranks , he must create a modern , rules-based state . 
Over the years , corruption has become endemic in China , with regional party leaders and bosses in state-owned enterprises wielding their vast privileges and authority to accumulate personal wealth . 
So far , Xi seems to be up to the challenge . 
He has been boldly pursuing major figures who were previously considered &quot; untouchable , &quot; such as General Xu Caihou , a former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission , and Zhou Yongkang , a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee , China &apos;s highest government body . 
But the long-term fight against corruption cannot depend on Xi alone . 
It will succeed only if strong institutions are created to protect and nurture the rule of law long after Xi is out of power . 
If Xi chooses to establish such institutions , he has a strong legal tradition upon which to call . 
As former US Ambassador to China Gary F. Locke reported in a speech early this year , the concept of equality before the law has deep historical roots . 
Indeed , in the fourth century BC , the statesman and reformer Shang Yang famously asserted that , &quot; When the prince violates the law , the crime he commits is the same as that of the common people . &quot; 
Building on this tradition , Xi can create strong institutions that will stand the test of time . 
If he does - recognizing that , to be credible , the rule of law must apply even to the Party &apos;s most influential figures - he will become modern China &apos;s third-strongest leader . 
In India , Mahatma Gandhi rejuvenated the country &apos;s soul , which had been battered by colonialism , and Jawaharlal Nehru established its democratic political culture . 
Modi now must lay the foundations for India &apos;s emergence as a global economic power . 
Replicating the 10 % annual growth rates achieved in Gujarat under Modi &apos;s leadership from 2004 to 2012 would obviously be a boon to India &apos;s development prospects and global standing . 
Other imperatives include shrinking the budget deficit , removing internal barriers to trade , and encouraging private investment . 
To win the support needed to implement these reforms without undermining political stability or social cohesion , Modi must demonstrate that he is an inclusive leader capable of cooperating with Indians outside of his Hindu nationalist base - including the country &apos;s 150 million-plus Muslims . 
If he succeeds , he , like Xi , will become his country &apos;s next iconic leader . 
In Indonesia &apos;s case , the two most influential leaders so far have been Sukarno , who used powerful rhetoric to foster a sense of national unity in one of the world &apos;s most diverse countries , and Suharto , who overthrew Sukarno and created a strong economic base that lifted millions out of poverty . 
Jokowi must now lay the institutional foundations for good governance . 
Jokowi has risen from humble beginnings to the apex of power without compromising his image as a &quot; man of the people &quot; or his reputation for pragmatism and honesty . 
Jokowi has a long track record of good governance , having implemented effective policies during his stint as Mayor of Surakarta ( such as refurbishing markets , relocating slum dwellers , and cutting bureaucratic red tape ) , and as Governor of Jakarta ( where he broadened access to health care and education ) . 
But replicating this success at the national level will be no easy feat . 
Jokowi , who takes office in October , must implement policies that address rising inequality , unsustainable fuel subsidies , entrenched corruption , inadequate infrastructure , and restrictive labor laws - all while rebuilding trust in Indonesian institutions . 
The challenges facing Jokowi are compounded by the fact that his ruling coalition holds only about one-third of the seats in Indonesia &apos;s parliament , with the rest loyal to the coalition of his rival in the presidential election , Prabowo Subianto . 
So , in introducing a new style of governance , exemplified by merit-based cabinet appointments , Jokowi must be careful not to alienate the political and business elites who have long benefited from their tight grip on power . 
In short , if Jokowi is to form a national consensus on the institutions that Indonesia needs , he will have to reach across this political divide . 
To this end , Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto &apos;s cross-party &quot; Pact for Mexico &quot; could serve as a useful model . 
Promisingly , Jokowi has a reputation for independence from partisan and religious politics , and a talent for communicating with the people . 
And , as a political outsider , he is in a unique position to direct Indonesia toward a more prosperous , united future - and vault himself into the country &apos;s pantheon of great leaders . 
China , India , and Indonesia are all well positioned to take important steps forward . 
A commitment by Xi , Modi , and Jokowi to do what is needed would bring rapid , far-reaching progress to their respective countries , Asia , and the global order .
