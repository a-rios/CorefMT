The False Promise of Financial Liberalization 
Something is amiss in the world of finance . 
The problem is not another financial meltdown in an emerging market , with the predictable contagion that engulfs neighboring countries . 
Even the most exposed countries handled the last round of financial shocks , in May and June 2006 , relatively comfortably . 
Instead , the problem this time around is one that relatively calm times have helped reveal : the predicted benefits of financial globalization are nowhere to be seen . 
Financial globalization is a recent phenomenon . 
One could trace its beginnings to the 1970 &quot; s , when recycled petrodollars fueled large capital inflows to developing nations . 
But it was only around 1990 that most emerging markets threw caution to the wind and removed controls on private portfolio and bank flows . 
Private capital flows have exploded since , dwarfing trade in goods and services . 
So the world has experienced true financial globalization only for 15 years or so . 
Freeing up capital flows had an inexorable logic - or so it seemed . 
Developing nations , the argument went , have plenty of investment opportunities , but are short of savings . 
Foreign capital inflows would allow them to draw on the savings of rich countries , increase their investment rates , and stimulate growth . 
In addition , financial globalization would allow poor nations to smooth out the boom-and-bust cycles associated with temporary terms-of-trade shocks and other bouts of bad luck . 
Finally , exposure to the discipline of financial markets would make it harder for profligate governments to misbehave . 
But things have not worked out according to plan . 
Research at the IMF , of all places , as well as by independent scholars documents a number of puzzles and paradoxes . 
For example , it is difficult to find evidence that countries that freed up capital flows have experienced sustained economic growth as a result . 
In fact , many emerging markets experienced declines in investment rates . 
Nor , on balance , has liberalization of capital flows stabilized consumption . 
Most intriguingly , the countries that have done the best in recent years are those that relied the least on foreign financing . 
China , the world &apos;s growth superstar , has a huge current-account surplus , which means that it is a net lender to the rest of the world . 
Among other high-growth countries , Vietnam &apos;s current account is essentially balanced , and India has only a small deficit . 
Latin America , Argentina and Brazil have been running comfortable external surpluses recently . 
In fact , their new-found resilience to capital-market shocks is due in no small part to their becoming net lenders to the rest of the world , after years as net borrowers . 
To understand what is going on , we need a different explanation of what keeps investment and growth low in most poor nations . 
Whereas the standard story - the one that motivated the drive to liberalize capital flows - is that developing countries are saving-constrained , the fact that capital is moving outward rather than inward in the most successful developing countries suggests that the constraint lies elsewhere . 
Most likely , the real constraint lies on the investment side . 
The main problem seems to be the paucity of entrepreneurship and low propensity to invest in plant and equipment - what Keynes called &quot; low animal spirits &quot; - especially to raise output of products that can be traded on world markets . 
Behind this shortcoming lay various institutional and market distortions associated with industrial and other modern-sector activities in low-income environments . 
When countries suffer from low investment demand , freeing up capital inflows does not do much good . 
What businesses in these countries need is not necessarily more finance , but the expectation of larger profits for their owners . 
In fact , capital inflows can make things worse , because they tend to appreciate the domestic currency and make production in export activities less profitable , further weakening the incentive to invest . 
Thus , the pattern in emerging market economies that liberalized capital inflows has been lower investment in the modern sectors of the economy , and eventually slower economic growth ( once the consumption boom associated with the capital inflows plays out ) . 
By contrast , countries like China and India , which avoided a surge of capital inflows , managed to maintain highly competitive domestic currencies , and thereby kept profitability and investment high . 
The lesson for countries that have not yet made the leap to financial globalization is clear : beware . 
Nothing can kill growth more effectively than an uncompetitive currency , and there is no faster route to currency appreciation than a surge in capital inflows . 
For those countries that have already made the leap , the choices are more difficult . 
Managing the exchange rate becomes much more difficult when capital is free to come and go as it pleases . 
But it is not impossible - as long as policymakers understand the critical role played by the exchange rate and the need to subordinate capital flows to the requirements of competitiveness . 
Given all the effort that the world &apos;s &quot; emerging markets &quot; have devoted to shielding themselves from financial volatility , they have reason to ask : where in the world is the upside of financial liberalization ? 
That is a question all of us should consider .
