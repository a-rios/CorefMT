Asia &apos;s Invention Boom 
BELLEVUE , WASHINGTON - For more than a century , the United States has been the dominant global force for innovation . 
But China and other Asian countries are now testing that dominance , and the West should welcome the challenge . 
China &apos;s move from imitation to innovation has been a matter of national policy in recent years . 
In 2011 , for example , the government established a set of ambitious targets for the production of patents . 
Almost immediately , China became the world &apos;s top patent filer . 
China soon surpassed the US in other important measures . 
Each year , Chinese universities award more PhD &apos;s in science and engineering than US institutions do - and more than twice as many undergraduate degrees in these fields . 
Moreover , China is set to outpace the US in investment in research and development . 
Since 2001 , China &apos;s R D expenditure has been growing by 18 % annually and has more than doubled as a share of GDP . 
In the US , that ratio has remained relatively constant . 
To be sure , such metrics can easily be manipulated - a fact that critics are quick to point out . 
But statistics from the US National Science Foundation reveal a genuine drive to innovate across much of Asia , with East , South , and Southeast Asian countries together spending more on R D than the US . 
And technology-intensive activity in the region is fast approaching that of North America and Western Europe . 
In fact , Asian countries are helping to fuel one another &apos;s innovative success . 
China &apos;s invention initiative has produced such rapid results in part because the government actively cooperates with its Asian competitors . 
Indeed , despite territorial disputes and other divisive issues , the commissioners of the patent offices of Japan , South Korea , China , and , to a lesser extent , Singapore and Taiwan meet often to define and coordinate their intellectual-property ( IP ) policies . 
China &apos;s leaders know that they can learn from countries like Japan and South Korea , which implemented policies to encourage innovation and protect IP rights long before China did . 
The precise impact of Asia &apos;s IP expansion is impossible to predict . 
But its transformative potential is obvious . 
Asian countries are essentially giving tens of thousands of top minds the opportunities and incentives to tackle today &apos;s most pressing challenges , such as developing cost-effective sustainable-energy solutions , ensuring affordable health care for aging populations , and improving the quality of life in overcrowded cities . 
These complex problems demand a plurality of innovative talent and long-term international collaboration - not just to find solutions , but also to deploy them . 
In an increasingly knowledge-based global economy , partnerships and cooperation will be the natural order . 
In this context , the West would be foolish to resist Asia &apos;s IP emergence . 
Instead , Western governments should support , learn from , and reap the rewards of the invention boom in the East . 
For example , the US , which leads the world in bringing innovative products to the market , should offer commercialization channels to innovative Chinese universities and small companies . 
And Chinese and Western companies should be encouraged to invest in one another &apos;s IP . 
Such cooperation has already begun . 
For example , in 2008 Intellectual Ventures ( which I helped found ) established a presence in China and other countries with emerging innovation cultures in order to focus their inventors &quot; talent and energy . 
The resulting global network of more than 400 institutions and over 4,000 active inventors has produced more patent applications than many R D-intensive companies do . 
In this ecosystem , everyone wins . 
The inventors gain access to the company &apos;s expertise in IP development and to an international community of experienced problem-solvers . 
Intellectual Ventures gets a stake in valuable solutions . 
Imagine if more such initiatives were launched , not only by companies , but also by governments . 
A cooperative approach could help to improve the troubled trade dynamics between Asia and the West , characterized by disagreement over China &apos;s lax enforcement of IP laws . 
Instead of shaking its fist , the West could provide incentives that encourage China to become a responsible actor in the existing IP regime . 
These could include , for example , efforts to organize viable alternatives to piracy for the tens of thousands of Chinese companies that currently earn a living from it . 
Some Western entrepreneurs already turn to these so-called Shan Zhai enterprises to manufacture their prototypes at scale , creating a kind of cross-border Kickstarter culture . 
Eventually , many Shan Zhai companies will evolve into legitimate businesses with their own IP . 
Given that Asian countries naturally will uphold and defend IP rights more vigorously when they have more at stake , the West should look for ways to hasten this transition . 
The West can also take some lessons from the various models Asian countries are experimenting with as they ramp up domestic innovation . 
In South Korea , LG recently launched a program to solicit invention ideas from the public , promising inventors a hefty 8 % stake in the proceeds of any ideas the company commercializes . 
That is probably not an approach that many American companies have considered . 
Asia is also experimenting with creative ways to finance innovation , such as China &apos;s IP exchanges and Malaysia &apos;s IP loan programs . 
The West should pay attention to these efforts , because they could offer alternatives to traditional avenues for sourcing and financing invention , such as venture capital , that are producing lackluster results . 
Finally , Western companies should be willing to supply inputs to Chinese businesses selling innovative products . 
This recommendation may seem radical , but only because the view of a one-way flow of innovation from West to East has become so entrenched . 
In fact , there is no good reason for Western businesses to stand on the sidelines as Asia produces whiz-kid entrepreneurs and high-tech start-ups . 
These pioneers are building ecosystems with points of entry at every level , and the West should enter at all of them . 
As Asian innovation comes into its own , the US and other developed countries must find ways to participate - or risk missing the opportunity of the century in a vain bid to recapture bygone supremacy .
