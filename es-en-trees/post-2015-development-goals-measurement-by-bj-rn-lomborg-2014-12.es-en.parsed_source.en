Measuring the Next Global Development Goals 
COPENHAGEN - At the start of the twenty-first century , the international community made some smart and simple promises with the so-called Millennium Development Goals . 
There have been many successes , though not all of the MDGs &quot; targets will be achieved . 
The target of halving hunger , for example , may be missed - though not by much . 
In 1991 , 23.4 % of all people in the developing world were malnourished ; more than a billion people went to bed hungry . 
By 2013 , the proportion had dropped to 13.5 % . 
Though the developing world had 1.7 billion more people than in 1991 , 209 million fewer were starving . 
Over the past 22 years , the world has managed to feed almost two billion more people adequately - no small feat . 
Over the next year , the world &apos;s 193 governments will come together to set new global targets to be met by 2030 . 
The task amounts to this generation &apos;s greatest opportunity to translate high aspirations into concrete targets . 
But choosing the targets that will do the most good requires learning from current experience . 
That choice should be based on a comparison of the proposed targets &quot; economic , social , and environmental costs and benefits . 
My think tank , the Copenhagen Consensus , has asked 60 teams of the world &apos;s top economists to examine most of them . 
Of course , high-profile issues that affect people &apos;s daily lives - for example , health , education , food security , clean water and sanitation , and the environment - attract the most attention . 
But we cannot simply assume that efforts to improve the situation are effective ; we also need to measure how well we address these issues , and measurement has real costs . 
After all , money spent on one priority is not available for others . 
In a recent paper for the Copenhagen Consensus , Morten Jerven of Simon Fraser University examines how much measurement will cost - and how much the international community can justify spending . 
And measuring turns out to be much harder than one might expect . 
For many indicators in the developing world , there is only a small amount of information about what has been achieved . 
There is no shortage of information available online about the number of poor people in almost any country in any year since 1990 ; but much of it is based on sketchy data . 
To estimate the number of poor in a country requires a household survey of consumption . 
But six of the 49 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have never had a household survey , and only 28 countries have had one in the past seven years . 
For example , according to the World Bank , 11.92 % of Botswana &apos;s population was poor in 2008 . 
Actually , there have been very few recent surveys , and most of the available numbers are projections and estimates , not hard data . 
Overall , there are more gaps than real observations , and the observations themselves are often dubious . 
Data collection for the MDGs was patchy , and the quality of much of the information collected was questionable . 
After assembling available information about survey costs around the world , Jerven estimates that proper monitoring of all 18 targets and 48 indicators would have cost $ 27 billion . 
This sounds like a lot , but it is only 1.4 % of the roughly $ 1.9 trillion spent on development aid during this period . 
In 2013 , a high-level panel of politicians and civil-society and private-sector leaders advocated the creation of &quot; better data-collection systems , especially in developing countries . &quot; 
Likewise , the so-called Open Working Group called on the world to &quot; increase significantly the availability of high-quality , timely , and reliable data disaggregated by income , gender , age , race , ethnicity , migratory status , disability , geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts . &quot; 
And this month , UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon specifically proposed establishing a &quot; comprehensive program of action on data . &quot; 
The problem is that the next set of targets is growing ever larger . 
The high-level panel suggested 59 , compared to 18 under the MDGs , and the Open Working Group nearly tripled the total number again , to 169 targets . 
Jerven estimates that carrying out even minimal data collection for all 169 would cost at least $ 254 billion - almost twice the entire annual global development budget . 
Even this is a low estimate . 
For starters , it does not includes the costs of national governments &quot; gathering of basic administrative data , or of all of the recommended household surveys , because these costs were impossible to obtain . 
And gathering data in countries where none has yet been collected will likely prove even costlier . 
Moreover , there is no allowance for maintaining national statistical offices , training and retaining personnel , or analyzing and disseminating the data . 
Given capacity constraints , particularly in the poor countries , this cost is likely to be high . 
Indeed , analyzing more long-term data for the international donor community may impede finance ministries &quot; ability to make high-frequency data available for running the country . 
The MDG agenda has already stretched statistical capacity ; 169 new targets will only make the situation worse . 
The MDGs were effective in part because the number of targets was limited . 
So it is reasonable to consider how many targets we could measure properly , rather than how to collect data on a large number of them . 
A useful point of comparison is what industrialized countries spend on their statistical services . 
For example , the Norwegian and British governments spend about 0.2 % of GDP . 
Using this figure as a rough indicator of willingness to pay for proper measurement and monitoring suggests that the post-2015 goals should include just four targets . 
As the international community gears up for the next development agenda , the danger is that we let our ambition overpower our reason . 
If we embrace too many targets - and especially an unwieldy 169 - we risk doing a disservice to the world &apos;s neediest people .
