Another Fine Italian Mess 
ROME - A game of smoke and mirrors : this is how Italy &apos;s current electoral campaign appears - both to Italians and the wider world . 
Of course , there is nothing new in this : Italy &apos;s political dynamics have always baffled participants and observers alike . 
That a small centrist party may now get the courts to postpone the election merely adds to the usual confusion . 
But one thing that seems certain this time is the likely result . 
Silvio Berlusconi , the leader of the right-wing alliance , will win his third election ( he has also lost twice ) , while the vote for the Senate is expected to produce a draw . 
In this case , Berlusconi &apos;s forces could ally themselves with Pier Ferdinando Casini &apos;s centrist Catholic party , or work to form a coalition with their center-left adversary , the Democratic Party , led by Walter Veltroni . 
The latter option , once unthinkable , is possible because Berlusconi is not running the type of inflammatory electoral campaign that he has in the past . 
The sharp tone and fierce partisanship of the past 13 years have been cast aside . 
Berlusconi seems to be fully aware of the difficulty of governing Italy . 
He needs to be . 
With public debt expected to stand at 102 % of GDP in 2009 , rising inflation , and growth of just 0.2 % , it will be difficult to keep electoral promises . 
Sagging public infrastructure and an inability to attract foreign capital have made the economic outlook even worse . 
In addition , while the state-owned companies Telecom , Autostrade , and Alitalia were subject to an extremely interventionist policy by Romano Prodi &apos;s outgoing government , they have little to show for it . 
Plans to build a high-speed train connecting Italy with northern Europe continue to experience delays . 
The garbage crisis in Naples remains unresolved putting the international reputation of one of Italy &apos;s most famous products , mozzarella , at risk . 
With global financial markets in crisis and Europe &apos;s economy softening , the challenges for the new Italian government will only become greater . 
Foreign policy , too , may prove difficult to manage . 
New activism on the part of France and the United Kingdom , along with Germany &apos;s emergence as a central player in EU affairs , risk marginalizing Italy &apos;s influence even more . 
If Berlusconi returns to office , he will again seek strong cooperation with the United States , the path now being followed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown . 
If he succeeds , something like a six-nation &quot; contact group &quot; ( France , the UK , Germany , Spain , Poland , and Italy ) will have formed to determine EU relations with the US . 
This leadership will be needed , because , regardless of who wins the US presidential election , the next American administration is bound to ask for greater EU participation in addressing international conflicts . 
But Italy , unlike France , is in no position to substitute the beauty of Carla Bruni , Sarkozy &apos;s new wife , for real prestige . 
To achieve that , the country must promote itself as a motor of serious European reform , without neglecting the debate on the member states &quot; role in the EU &apos;s economic choices . 
Here Italy could join the more nationally minded economic policies now being pursued by France and the UK , to the detriment of EU technocrats in Brussels . 
The one thing that seems certain from the upcoming vote is that - barring any last-minute surprises - the billionaire Berlusconi will re-assert his hold over Italian politics . 
In fact , he has been Italy &apos;s true ruler for the past 13 years . 
Born as a &quot; plastic party &quot; to unite a gamut of political forces following the implosion of the Christian Democrats in 1994 , Berlusconi &apos;s Forza Italia showed itself to be a very cunningly structured movement , with a strong and stable consensus among its members on core doctrine . 
In this election , Berlusconi decided to open the door to Gianfranco Fini &apos;s right-wing National Alliance , with which he founded a new group , People of Freedom - the only party allied with Umberto Bossi &apos;s Northern League - in an effort to ensure that the government is backed by an even stronger and more cohesive core party . 
The Catholics of the Union of Christian and Center Democrats and the post-fascist right of Francesco Storace have left the coalition . 
A similar choice was made on the left by Veltroni , whose Democratic Party is now allied with Antonio Di Pietro &apos;s Italy of Values Party . 
The Communist Party and the Socialists have left the coalition that Prodi forged to gain his parliamentary majority . 
The purpose of this realignment was to create more stable large parties , but further changes are likely . 
Strong pan-European center-right and center-left political parties are likely to contest the European Parliament elections in the spring of 2009 . 
As Europe presses ahead with reform , the question for Italy is whether smoke and mirrors is all its politics have to offer .
