Vladimir de Gaulle ? 
MOSCOW  -  
Most policymakers and experts expected that , after an inevitably troublesome period of transition , Russia would join the United States and Europe in a strategic and economic partnership , based on shared interests and values . 
The pace of change might be doubtful , but not its direction . 
Vladimir Putin &apos;s massive electoral triumph in this week &apos;s Duma elections has put the lie to that notion . 
Today , shared interests have shrunk and values have diverged . 
A resurgent Russia is the world &apos;s foremost revisionist power , rejecting a status quo predicated on the notion of a Western victory in the Cold War . 
Its two super-power assets - nuclear weapons and energy - make it a potential leader of all those lesser powers dissatisfied with their position in the world . 
A potential Russia-China axis based on shared resistance to US hegemony carries the seeds of a new bipolarity . 
Western expectations of postcommunist Russia &apos;s trajectory rested on three assumptions that proved to be mistaken . 
First , most of Russia &apos;s elite rejected the view that the loss of empire was irreversible . 
Second , the Bush administration &apos;s unilateralism shattered the belief that the US would continue to provide the world with &quot; multilateral &quot; leadership ; indeed , US unilateralism was a cue for Russia to pursue its own unilateral policy . 
Third , Russia has not yet become economically integrated with the West , especially Europe , as was expected . 
What happens when the pull of a country &apos;s imperial history meets the constraints of its current international position ? 
Will it try to weaken the constraints ? 
The first option may involve international conflict , the second domestic conflict . 
I believe that the attempt by President Putin &apos;s Kremlin to impose &quot; liberal empire &quot; or &quot; sovereign democracy &quot; on the post-Soviet states will fail . 
Of course , Russia is bound to exercise strong influence in the former Soviet territories , but it will have to share that influence with others . 
Russia has too little to offer for exclusive dominance . 
The European Union , the US , and China offer the former Soviet republics opportunities for &quot; balancing &quot; against Russia . 
Of course , it is not very difficult to envisage the voluntary reincorporation of the ethnic Russian populations of Belarus , eastern Ukraine , and northern Kazakhstan into the Russian Federation - but only in a context in which Russia emerges as a true regional leader on a par with the EU . 
Alternatively ( or coincidentally ) , Russia might discover a new business center of gravity in Central Asia and East Asia , though this would hardly be the &quot; liberal empire &quot; that Anatoli Chubais once envisaged , for it would be based on the mutual attraction of autocrats . 
Russia also will not transform its economic system along Anglo-American lines . 
We may see some compromise between European ( Sarkozy-style ) capitalism and an authoritarian , protectionist model with a lot of industrial policy . 
This is the kind of civilizational choice that sovereign countries are entitled to make for themselves . 
The territorial and economic imperatives of empire will continue to make it difficult for Russia to develop a political system that conforms to Western norms . 
The middle class will expand , but there is no assurance that it will become &quot; liberal &quot; in the Western sense . 
So Russia &apos;s political system will probably remain autocratic for the foreseeable future , with a facade of democracy . 
While this is disappointing , it is an improvement on anything Russia has ever experienced , except briefly . 
It is hard to see Russia offering the world a new type of universalism , as it once did with communism . 
The Russian strain of political messianism is pretty much exhausted . 
Nevertheless , Russia may be able to develop , out of its own spiritual and cultural resources , an attractive alternative to both the American and European models , provided it achieves long run economic success . 
If Russia fails in its attempt to become an independent center of power to rival the US ( and eventually China ) , what role will it play ? 
A suggestive analogy may be to France during the long period of Anglo-American hegemony . 
Broadly speaking , France has been the &quot; awkward partner &quot; in the Anglo-American club - a role it played right up to its orchestration of opposition to the Iraq war in 2003 . 
Twice in the twentieth century - in 1931 and again in 1969-70 - France helped to bring down the world monetary system . 
Charles de Gaulle took France out of the NATO military alliance in 1966 . 
France , uniquely in Western Europe , built its own independent nuclear deterrent , and has been a champion of creating a European military capacity outside NATO . 
Without explicitly challenging US leadership , France tried to build its own &quot; Ostpolitik &quot; with Russia , and to use its axis with Germany to create a European position on foreign policy . 
The French have been the most insistent that Europe has interests that are not identical to America &apos;s - particularly in the Middle East , where France has been pro-Arab . 
And , like de Gaulle , Putin has sought to rescue his country from humiliation and defeat by carving out a role consonant with popular feelings of national mission and pride , with national interest interpreted as &quot; sovereignty . &quot; 
The Gaullist dream of creating an independent power center never succeeded , but the role of &quot; awkward partner &quot; has given a distinctive flavor to French diplomacy , and it may be equally viable for a shrunken , proud , but no longer hegemonic Russia . 
Being an &quot; awkward partner &quot; may offer Russia its best hope of reconciling its yearning for independence with the realities of the modern world .
