The Year of Betting Conservatively 
NEW YORK - The upswing in global equity markets that started in July is now running out of steam , which comes as no surprise : with no significant improvement in growth prospects in either the advanced or major emerging economies , the rally always seemed to lack legs . 
If anything , the correction might have come sooner , given disappointing macroeconomic data in recent months . 
Starting with the advanced countries , the eurozone recession has spread from the periphery to the core , with France entering recession and Germany facing a double whammy of slowing growth in one major export market ( China / Asia ) and outright contraction in others ( southern Europe ) . 
Economic growth in the United States has remained anemic , at 1.5-2 % for most of the year , and Japan is lapsing into a new recession . 
The United Kingdom , like the eurozone , has already endured a double-dip recession , and now even strong commodity exporters - Canada , the Nordic countries , and Australia - are slowing in the face of headwinds from the US , Europe , and China . 
Meanwhile , emerging-market economies - including all of the BRICs ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) and other major players like Argentina , Turkey , and South Africa - also slowed in 2012 . 
China &apos;s slowdown may be stabilized for a few quarters , given the government &apos;s latest fiscal , monetary , and credit injection ; but this stimulus will only perpetuate the country &apos;s unsustainable growth model , one based on too much fixed investment and savings and too little private consumption . 
In 2013 , downside risks to global growth will be exacerbated by the spread of fiscal austerity to most advanced economies . 
Until now , the recessionary fiscal drag has been concentrated in the eurozone periphery and the UK . 
And in the US , even if President Barack Obama and the Republicans in Congress agree on a budget plan that avoids the looming &quot; fiscal cliff , &quot; spending cuts and tax increases will invariably lead to some drag on growth in 2013 - at least 1 % of GDP . 
In Japan , the fiscal stimulus from post-earthquake reconstruction will be phased out , while a new consumption tax will be phased in by 2014 . 
The International Monetary Fund is thus absolutely right in arguing that excessively front-loaded and synchronized fiscal austerity in most advanced economies will dim global growth prospects in 2013 . 
So , what explains the recent rally in US and global asset markets ? 
The answer is simple : Central banks have turned on their liquidity hoses again , providing a boost to risky assets . 
The US Federal Reserve has embraced aggressive , open-ended quantitative easing ( QE ) . 
The European Central Bank &apos;s announcement of its &quot; outright market transactions &quot; program has reduced the risk of a sovereign-debt crisis in the eurozone periphery and a breakup of the monetary union . 
The Bank of England has moved from QE to CE ( credit easing ) , and the Bank of Japan has repeatedly increased the size of its QE operations . 
And , with slow growth , subdued inflation , near-zero short-term interest rates , and more QE , longer-term interest rates in most advanced economies remain low ( with the exception of the eurozone periphery , where sovereign risk remains relatively high ) . 
It is small wonder , then , that investors desperately searching for yield have rushed into equities , commodities , credit instruments , and emerging-market currencies . 
But now a global market correction seems underway , owing , first and foremost , to the poor growth outlook . 
At the same time , the eurozone crisis remains unresolved , despite the ECB &apos;s bold actions and talk of a banking , fiscal , economic , and political union . 
Specifically , Greece , Portugal , Spain , and Italy are still at risk , while bailout fatigue pervades the eurozone core . 
Moreover , political and policy uncertainties - on the fiscal , debt , taxation , and regulatory fronts - abound . 
In the US , the fiscal worries are threefold : the risk of a &quot; cliff &quot; in 2013 , as tax increases and massive spending cuts kick in automatically if no political agreement is reached ; renewed partisan combat over the debt ceiling ; and a new fight over medium-term fiscal austerity . 
In many other countries or regions - for example , China , Korea , Japan , Israel , Germany , Italy , and Catalonia - upcoming elections or political transitions have similarly increased policy uncertainty . 
Yet another reason for the correction is that valuations in stock markets are stretched : price / earnings ratios are now high , while growth in earnings per share is slackening , and will be subject to further negative surprises as growth and inflation remain low . 
With uncertainty , volatility , and tail risks on the rise again , the correction could accelerate quickly . 
Indeed , there are now greater geopolitical uncertainties as well : the risk of an Iran-Israel military confrontation remains high as negotiations and sanctions may not deter Iran from developing nuclear-weapons capacity ; a new war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is likely ; the Arab Spring is turning into a grim winter of economic , social , and political instability ; and territorial disputes in Asia between China , Korea , Japan , Taiwan , the Philippines , and Vietnam are inflaming nationalist forces . 
As consumers , firms , and investors become more cautious and risk-averse , the equity-market rally of the second half of 2012 has crested .
