Robert Rubin Revisited 
Economists and historians will long debate the contrast between the economic policies of the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush . 
The Clinton administration took office with remarkably few cards , and the cards it held were dreadful : a long-term legacy of extremely slow economic growth , huge federal budget deficits created by the Ronald Reagan / George H. W. Bush administrations of 1980-1992 , a relatively high &quot; natural &quot; rate of unemployment , and growing inflationary pressure . 
By contrast , George W. Bush &apos;s administration took office with stunningly good cards : a budget in substantial surplus , a trend of rapid productivity growth as the information-technology revolution reached critical mass , and a very low &quot; natural &quot; rate of unemployment . 
Despite its handicaps , nearly everything that the Clinton economic policy team touched turned to gold . 
Led by Robert Rubin , first as an Assistant to the President and later as Secretary of the Treasury , it turned the gargantuan Reagan / Bush deficits into huge surpluses ; it successfully enhanced America &apos;s high-investment / high productivity growth recovery ; it pursued initiatives to reduce trade barriers . 
The Clinton team could also take credit for the largely successful handling of the 1994 Mexican and 1997-1998 Asian financial crises . 
By contrast , nearly everything that George W. Bush &apos;s economic policy team has touched has turned to , well , if not lead , at least to a state that inspires observers , both inside and outside the administration , to shake their heads and mutter about a horribly wasted opportunity . 
On trade , on fiscal policy , on reform of social entitlements , on almost every issue you can name , the Bush team has worsened conditions substantially . 
Reading Rubin &apos;s recently published memoir In an Uncertain World , we can begin to understand this striking difference better . 
Begin by noting that the title page of In an Uncertain World states that its authors are Robert Rubin and Jacob Weisberg . 
How often does the person who crafts the prose for a memoir of a public figure get his or her name on the cover ? 
Weisberg is not given a mere &quot; with , &quot; but the full credit of a co-author that the word &quot; and &quot; delivers . 
This is a key facet of Robert Rubin &apos;s strength : he is a classy guy , one who believes that credit is to be shared . 
What Rubin sees as most important in developing policy is the habit of &quot; probabilistic thinking . &quot; 
This means a willingness to ask , &quot; What else might happen ? , &quot; &quot; What if we &apos;re wrong ? , &quot; &quot; What could happen next ? , &quot; and to look at the full range of potential outcomes - at their costs as well as their benefits - rather than assuming that results will match some fashionable ideology or favorite administration model . 
All forecasts , after all , turn out to be wrong in at least one vital dimension . 
Pounding a table and shouting does not make unwanted facts disappear . 
Rubin &apos;s recognition that the world is a complicated , poorly-understood place , where lots of unexpected and surprising things happen - and where we cannot merely consult some map drawn by John Maynard Keynes or Milton Friedman or some neo-conservative pundit - seems to have been the most powerful of his secret weapons . 
But in reading In an Uncertain World , you soon see that &quot; probabilistic thinking &quot; was not Rubin &apos;s only weapon . 
He also worked for a president who cared deeply about policy as well as politics - and who was willing to be convinced , at least most of the time , that good policy would turn out in the long run to be good politics . 
Rubin also used the remarkable management skills that he had honed as chairman of the investment bank Goldman Sachs to great effect . 
I recall sitting in the back of the White House &apos;s Roosevelt Room and watching , amazed , as he guided meetings of the National Economic Council to the consensus he wanted by little more than raising his eyebrows and calling on people in the appropriate order . 
All of these policymaking skills , however , would have been of little use had they not been pointed in the right direction . 
I think that the principal reason for Rubin &apos;s ( and Clinton &apos;s ) extraordinary economic policy success - all the more so in view of the weak cards the administration was dealt - was the ability to hew to the true object of government : to always keep the big picture in mind . 
In his memoir , Rubin recalls a moment when he held firm on world trade : &quot; Protecting industries is usually appealing , because the negative consequences of free trade are so visible .... 
Clinton remembered ... seeing some poor fisherman casting their lines .... 
We , too , need to keep our eye on the big picture . 
That means that we must make it more likely in the future that people as capable and wise as Robert Rubin will find it attractive to enter public service , and that once there , they will have the power to make a difference .
