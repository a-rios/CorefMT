America &apos;s Trouble with China 
WASHINGTON , DC - Xi Jinping , China &apos;s newly anointed president , made his first visit to the United States in May 1980 . 
He was a 27-year-old junior officer accompanying Geng Biao , then a vice premier and China &apos;s leading military official . 
Geng had been my host the previous January , when I was the first US defense secretary to visit China , acting as an interlocutor for President Jimmy Carter &apos;s administration . 
Americans had little reason to notice Xi back then , but his superiors clearly saw his potential . 
In the ensuing 32 years , Xi &apos;s stature rose , along with China &apos;s economic and military strength . 
His cohort &apos;s ascent to the summit of power marks the retirement of the last generation of leaders designated by Deng Xiaoping ( though they retain influence ) . 
Despite China &apos;s greater weight in world affairs , Xi faces internal strains that make China more fragile than is generally understood . 
China &apos;s export-led economic model has reached its limits , and the transition to domestic-led growth is intensifying internal frictions . 
Managing unrest through repression is more difficult than in the past , as rapid urbanization , economic reform , and social change roils a country of 1.3 billion people . 
Ethnic conflicts in outlying regions will also test Xi &apos;s political control . 
China &apos;s foreign policy is another cause for concern - especially for the US . 
For now , the large bilateral trade imbalance has exacerbated US-China tensions , and can be safely reduced only by changes in behavior on both sides - or , unsafely , though a dangerous crisis-driven correction . 
More immediately , China &apos;s territorial claims - particularly in the South China Sea , but also regarding its border with India - and its efforts to expand its influence over neighboring countries will force the US to navigate two overarching risks . 
The first is confrontation , which could occur directly or as a result of the US being drawn into conflicts between China and its neighbors . 
The other risk is that Japan , South Korea , Vietnam , the Philippines , Thailand , or Myanmar could fall into China &apos;s strategic orbit . 
Many of these countries will look to the US as a strategic counterweight should China seek to assert local dominance . 
As recent events in the East and South China Seas show , China sometimes attempts to strong-arm its neighbors . 
The US will need to defend its allies and interests by pushing back , but with actions modulated to limit Chinese concerns . 
One way to do this is to understand China &apos;s motives . 
China &apos;s drive for economic and political leadership in East Asia , and its increased military capability there , is inevitable . 
That argues against American overreaction , which could fuel the kind of self-reinforcing downward spiral in bilateral relations that occurred between Great Britain and Germany prior to the conflagrations of the first half of the twentieth century . 
But getting to 2030 without a major confrontation will be a major achievement . 
While the US is likely to maintain the upper hand in terms of military power for at least another 15-20 years , asymmetric warfare could undercut America &apos;s advantage should China engage in cyber-attacks on US electronic and satellite systems , along with attacks on infrastructure . 
In response to China &apos;s capability to project power many hundreds of miles from its borders , the US ( as I have suggested for the last 25 years ) should develop a long-range bomber capable of penetrating sophisticated defenses and delivering great force . 
As US security interests shift to the Pacific , Americans now rely on increasingly vulnerable forward land bases and carrier fleets with tactical aircraft that have a combat radius of 300-500 miles ( 482-805 kilometers ) . 
That said , America &apos;s most serious challenge right now is to get the US economy and its governance in order . 
I believe that it can do that .
