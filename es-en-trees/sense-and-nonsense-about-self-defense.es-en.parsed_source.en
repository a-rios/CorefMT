Sense and Nonsense about Self-Defense 
If patriotism is , as Samuel Johnson suggested , the last refuge of a scoundrel , then self-defense is the last refuge of an aggressor . 
The justification of self-defense comes readily to the lips of both paranoids and those who reasonably wish to defend themselves against imminent attack . 
The argument for America &apos;s putative invasion of Iraq is , of course , self-defense , that is , the need to shield itself and its allies against Saddam Hussein &apos;s possible use of weapons of mass destruction . 
But claims of &quot; self-defense &quot; also find less reputable invocations . 
Timothy McVeigh , the Oklahoma City bomber who murdered 168 people in 1995 , thought he was defending the US Constitution against a predatory federal government . 
Yigal Amir thought he was defending Israel against a Prime Minister willing to surrender sacred land to the enemy when he assassinated Yitzak Rabin later in the same year . 
Perpetrators of violent acts rarely concede that they are aggression pure and simple , rather than actions in defense of life , liberty , or some other important value . 
Is there a sensible boundary between sense and nonsense in claiming self-defense ? 
Lawyers must seek this distinction , for if we surrender to the rhetorical claims of statesmen and paranoids , the line between aggression and self-defense will disappear . 
The UN has tried to delimit the scope of self-defense , but it goes too far by permitting states to resort to force only if &quot; an armed attack occurs . &quot; 
This makes little sense , because states must retain the right to defend themselves against impending attacks as well . 
Imagine , say , the Japanese warplanes zeroing in on Pearl Harbor on December 7 th , 1941 . 
The United States Navy surely had the right to defend itself - if it could - before the bombs fell . 
Or consider Nasser &apos;s massing of Egyptian troops on Israel &apos;s border in 1967 , threatening to wipe it off the map . 
Is this not akin to a mugger pointing a gun at your head and threatening to shoot ? 
If self-defense is not permissible in cases of manifest , imminent attack , then the doctrine can hardly appeal to ordinary moral intuitions . 
But these clear examples quickly fade into an ambiguous and disputed range of cases , such as Israel &apos;s fear of Iraq &apos;s Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981 . 
Building a nuclear reactor is a far cry from launching a nuclear missile . 
Israel &apos;s bombing of the Osirak reactor must , therefore , be regarded as a &quot; preemptive &quot; or a &quot; preventive &quot; strike - words meant to capture the shadow land of self-defense . 
There is little point in struggling with the meaning of these elusive words , because both miss the point . 
Some say that the real point is the risk of attack and the destruction that might occur if weapons of mass destruction are deployed . 
They employ something like a cost / benefit analysis based on a subjective sense of danger . 
But there is no way of making an objective assessment of fear , and even if it were possible , using cost / benefit analysis to invade the territory of another country would wreak havoc with the global system of national sovereignty and international law . 
The better way to make sense of self-defense is to invoke two principles that underlie legal claims of justification in both domestic and international law . 
The first principle is reciprocity , which implies that if Israel had the right to attack the Osirak reactor , then Iraq had the right to bomb the Israeli nuclear facility at Dimona . 
If America now has the right to attack Baghdad , then Iraq - which has made no public statements of aggressive intent toward the US - has the reciprocal right to attack Washington . 
What is good for the goose must be good for the gander . 
There is no way for a state to claim as a matter of law : You are a &quot; rogue &quot; state and we are good guys , and therefore we operate under different rules . 
Admittedly , prior actions and intentions matter in making a judgment about whether to fear an attack . 
In the relationship between Israel and Iraq , Saddam Hussein &apos;s lobbing of scud missiles at Tel Aviv in 1991 has relevance in judging the dictator &apos;s current intentions toward Israel . 
But there is no comparable evidence of Iraqi aggressive behavior against US territory . 
This brings into focus the second requirement of self-defense . 
Evidence of aggressive design must be public and visible to all . 
Publicity is a critical element in a legal culture . 
Impending aggression cannot be documented in secret dossiers but only by events that can be filmed by CNN . 
The aggressor must do something that all can see as a dangerous threat by , for example , aiming a guided missile at a country and threatening to use it . 
If we look back at irrational claims of individual self-defense - McVeigh , Amir , and others - we see that their fears were based on private evidence not shared by more than a small circle of friends and co-conspirators , at most . 
Insisting on public evidence provides some guarantee against paranoid self-defense by individuals and political manipulation by national leaders . 
If the requirements of reciprocity and publicity are applied to the current plans to invade Iraq , the implications are clear . 
If they are not , President George W. Bush risks engaging in unlawful aggression against a foreign country .
