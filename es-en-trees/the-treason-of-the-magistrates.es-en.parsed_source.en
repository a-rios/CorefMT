The Treason of the Magistrates 
PARIS - In democracies , justice is supposed to be independent . 
Some prosecutors and investigating magistrates , however , conveniently forget this . 
Indeed many among them are deeply enmeshed in politics , pursuing agendas - and vendettas - of their own . 
The phenomenon of politicized prosecutors and investigating magistrates is becoming global , arising in democracies as diverse as Japan , Italy , France , Spain , Turkey , and Argentina . 
In all these countries , prosecutors and magistrates hurl accusations of corruption against governments and ruling parties - charges that also happen to suit the political and institutional interests of the magistrates . 
Japan &quot; s state prosecutor has , for example , accused Ichiro Ozawa , the General-Secretary of the newly elected Democratic Party of Japan , of having received illegal funds to run the DPJ &apos;s recent campaign against the Liberal Democratic Party . 
That three close aides to Ozawa have been indicted only months after the DPJ &apos;s victory strikes many Japanese as odd , given the well known corruption of the LDP when in power . 
But the LDP worked hand in glove with Japan &apos;s deeply entrenched bureaucracy , of which the prosecutors are a part . 
The DPJ has vowed to shake up the cozy relations between Japan &apos;s bureaucrats , politicians , and big business . 
By indicting people close to Ozawa , the prosecutors appear to be acting in defense of the status quo . 
In Italy , prosecutors in Rome , following the lead of their colleagues in Milan , are now going after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi . 
Italy &apos;s investigating magistrates have consistently refused to accept the popularity and electoral power of a business tycoon whom they have tried to convict for many years . 
Berlusconi may not be the most refined of Italians , but after many trials it has never been proven that he committed any crime . 
Yet magistrates continue to haul him into court . 
In France , Paris magistrates attempted for years to indict former President Jacques Chirac on charges of corruption . 
So long as Chirac was president , there was no legal way to pursue him . 
Chirac is alleged to have employed municipal civil servants when he was the mayor of Paris , 20 years ago , as aides in his electoral campaign . 
Let us remember that no judge ever indicted François Mitterrand , Chirac &apos;s socialist predecessor , for using government funds to entertain his mistress and illegitimate daughter . 
As further proof of the politicized nature of some French magistrates , immediately after former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin was cleared of charges that he had tried to smear President Nicolas Sarkozy , the prosecuting magistrate announced that he would appeal the court &apos;s ruling and prosecute de Villepin again . 
In Buenos Aires , one wonders about the motives of the Supreme Court , which has forbidden President Kristina Kirchner from changing the chairman of the central bank . 
Kirchner is not above suspicion , but the judges &quot; lack of a watertight legal case raises suspicions of a political motive . 
The situation is more byzantine , but just as politicized , in Turkey , where prosecutors and judges have consistently set their sights on the moderately Islamic Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) in the name of protecting the secular constitution . 
After the AKP was elected in 2003 , the Supreme Court dissolved it in order to prevent Recep Tayyip Erdogan from becoming Prime Minister . 
The AKP had to change its name and , for a time , Erdogan had to foreswear the premiership . 
In 2008 , prosecutors again tried to have the AKP dissolved , on charges that it was undermining the constitution . 
In 2009 , the Supreme Court dissolved the main legal Kurdish party , the DST , accused of being connected with the Kurdish guerillas . 
This arbitrary decision deprived millions of Kurds from any legal representation and disrupted the AKP government &apos;s attempt to reconcile the Kurds with the Turkish Republic . 
Of course , not all judges and prosecutors engage in nakedly partisan activities . 
European prosecutors tend to lean to the left , whereas their Latin American and Japanese counterparts tend to be conservative and pro-establishment . 
Perhaps the most famous investigating magistrate of all , Spain &apos;s Baltasar Garzon , is usually portrayed as waging a borderless crusade for justice . 
His targets , however , almost invariably come from the political right . But rather than pursuing such an open ideological agenda , most activist magistrates tend to act as a corporation : their motives can be politicized , but their professional , guild interests come first . 
Famously in France &apos;s Ancien Régime , the judges collectively acted as a close-knit , self-contained social class . 
The French Revolution and the introduction of universal suffrage were aimed as much at ridding France of the corporation of judges as they were at getting rid of the nobility . 
But , despite democratization , judges and prosecutors everywhere have tended to resurrect themselves as a self-appointed elite , insulated by society &apos;s desire that justice be seen as independent . 
When one looks closely at the careers of judges in the above-mentioned countries , the law can vary , but cooptation is the usual rule of the game : a successful judge or prosecutor , in order to climb the professional ladder , must follow the guidance of his peers and increase the influence of his corporation . 
One should also consider why anyone wants to become a judge . 
Aspiring judicial candidates usually want to &quot; clean up &quot; society . 
It is revealing that in Italy , in the 1980 &quot; s , the judges who battled the Sicilian mafia described their campaign as &quot; clean hands . &quot; 
In that case , the label fit . 
More often , however , the cleansing is a pretext to change political direction after the people have voted in a way that magistrates oppose . 
Democracy is supposedly based on a separation and balance of institutional power . 
That equilibrium works so long as each institution is submitted to close scrutiny - which judges and magistrates have simply avoided . 
I see no reason to trust judges and prosecutors more than presidents and legislators . 
It is high time for the supposed Fourth Estate - the media - to scrutinize the behavior and motives of judges and prosecutors , both individually and collectively , in the same way they do elected officials .
