Ideas over Interests 
CAMBRIDGE - The most widely held theory of politics is also the simplest : the powerful get what they want . 
Financial regulation is driven by the interests of banks , health policy by the interests of insurance companies , and tax policy by the interests of the rich . 
Those who can influence government the most - through their control of resources , information , access , or sheer threat of violence - eventually get their way . 
It &apos;s the same globally . 
Foreign policy is determined , it is said , first and foremost by national interests - not affinities with other nations or concern for the global community . 
International agreements are impossible unless they are aligned with the interests of the United States and , increasingly , other rising major powers . 
In authoritarian regimes , policies are the direct expression of the interests of the ruler and his cronies . 
It is a compelling narrative , one with which we can readily explain how politics so often generates perverse outcomes . 
Whether in democracies , dictatorships , or in the international arena , those outcomes reflect the ability of narrow , special interests to achieve results that harm the majority . 
Yet this explanation is far from complete , and often misleading . 
Interests are not fixed or predetermined . 
Our perceptions of self-interest are always filtered through the lens of ideas . 
Consider a struggling firm that is trying to improve its competitive position . 
One strategy is to lay off some workers and outsource production to cheaper locations in Asia . 
Alternatively , the firm can invest in skills training and build a more productive workforce with greater loyalty and hence lower turnover costs . 
It can compete on price or on quality . 
The mere fact that the firm &apos;s owners are self-interested tells us little about which of these strategies will be followed . 
What ultimately determines the firm &apos;s choice is a whole series of subjective evaluations of the likelihood of different scenarios , alongside a calculation of their costs and benefits . 
Similarly , imagine that you are a despotic ruler in a poor country . 
What is the best way to maintain your power and pre-empt domestic and foreign threats ? 
Do you build a strong , export-oriented economy ? 
Or do you turn inward and reward your military friends and other cronies , at the expense of almost everyone else ? 
Authoritarian rulers in East Asia embraced the first strategy ; their counterparts in the Middle East opted for the second . 
They had different conceptions of where their interest lay . 
Or consider China &apos;s role in the global economy . 
As the People &apos;s Republic becomes a major power , its leaders will have to decide what kind of international system they want . 
Perhaps they will choose to build on and strengthen the existing multilateral regime , which has served them well in the past . 
But perhaps they will prefer bilateral , ad hoc relations that allow them to extract greater advantage in their transactions with individual countries . 
We cannot predict the shape that the world economy will take just from observing that China and its interests will loom larger . 
We could multiply such examples endlessly . 
Are German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s domestic political fortunes best served by stuffing austerity down Greece &apos;s throat , at the cost of another debt restructuring down the line , or by easing up on its conditions , which might give Greece a chance to grow out of its debt burden ? 
Are US interests at the World Bank best served by directly nominating an American , or by cooperating with other countries to select the most suitable candidate , American or not ? 
The fact that we debate such questions passionately suggests that we all have varying conceptions of where self-interest lies . 
Our interests are in fact hostage to our ideas . 
So , where do those ideas come from ? 
Policymakers , like all of us , are slaves to fashion . 
Their perspectives on what is feasible and desirable are shaped by the zeitgeist , the &quot; ideas in the air . &quot; 
This means that economists and other thought leaders can exert much influence - for good or ill . 
John Maynard Keynes once famously said that &quot; even the most practical man of affairs is usually in the thrall of the ideas of some long-dead economist . &quot; 
He probably didn &apos;t put it nearly strongly enough . 
The ideas that have produced , for example , the unbridled liberalization and financial excess of the last few decades have emanated from economists who are ( for the most part ) very much alive . 
In the aftermath of the financial crisis , it became fashionable for economists to decry the power of big banks . 
But this argument conveniently overlooks the legitimizing role played by economists themselves . 
It was economists and their ideas that made it respectable for policymakers and regulators to believe that what is good for Wall Street is good for Main Street . 
Economists love theories that place organized special interests at the root of all political evil . 
In the real world , they cannot wriggle so easily out of responsibility for the bad ideas that they have so often spawned . 
With influence must come accountability .
