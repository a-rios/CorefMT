Europe &apos;s Power to Lead 
CAMBRIDGE  -  
One Asian analyst argued that by 2050 , there will be three world powers : the United States , China , and India . 
He did not mention Europe , but underestimating Europe &apos;s power is a mistake . 
Yes , Europe currently punches below its weight . 
It is fragmented , peaceful , and normative in a world of hard power , but part of the world is not about military power . 
The use of force among advanced industrial democracies is virtually unthinkable . 
In their relations with each other , such countries are all from Venus , to paraphrase Robert Kagan , and here Europe &apos;s focus on law and institutions is an asset . 
As for other parts of the world , a recent Pew poll found that many Europeans would like Europe to play a larger role , but to balance American military power would require a doubling or tripling of defense spending , and few Europeans are interested in such an increase . 
Nevertheless , a smart strategy for Europe will require greater investments in hard power . 
The picture for Europe , however , is not as bleak as pessimists assume . 
Power is the ability to get the outcomes one wants , and the resources that produce such behavior depend upon the context . 
In functional terms , power is distributed like a three-dimensional chess game . 
On the top board are military relations among states , with the US the world &apos;s only superpower with global reach . 
Here the world is uni-polar . 
On the middle board are economic relations , where the world is already multi-polar . 
Here , Europe acts as a union , and other countries like Japan and China play big roles . 
The US cannot reach a trade agreement or settle anti-trust cases without the approval of the EU . 
The bottom chessboard includes transnational relations outside the control of governments - everything from drugs to infectious diseases to climate change to terrorism . 
On this board , power is chaotically distributed among non-state actors , and it makes no sense to call this world either uni-polar or multipolar . 
Here , close civilian cooperation is important , for which Europe is well endowed . 
European countries &quot; success in overcoming centuries of animosity , and the development of a large internal market , has given them a great deal of soft power . 
At the Cold War &apos;s end , East European countries did not try to form local alliances , as they did in the 1920 &quot; s , but looked toward Brussels to secure their future . 
Similarly , countries like Turkey and Ukraine have adjusted their policies in response to their attraction to Europe . 
Recently , the US National Intelligence Council published four widely different scenarios for the world in 2020 : Davos World , in which economic globalization continues , but with a more Asian face ; 
New Caliphate , where Islamic religious identity challenges the dominance of western norms ; and Cycle of Fear , in which non-state forces create shocks to security that produce Orwellian societies . 
Like any exercises in futurology , such scenarios have their limits , but they help us ask which three or four major political factors will help shape the outcome . The first is the rise of Asia . 
The big question will be China and its internal evolution . 
China has lifted 400 million people out of poverty since 1990 , but another 400 million still live on less than $ 2 per day . 
Unlike India , China has not solved the problem of political participation . 
If China replaces its eroded communism with nationalism or ensure social cohesion , the result could be a more aggressive foreign policy and unwillingness to deal with issues like climate change . 
Europe can contribute significantly to China &apos;s integration into global norms and institutions . 
In general , Europe and the US have more to fear from a weak China than they do from a wealthy China . 
Political Islam and how it develops will be the second factor . 
The struggle against extreme Islamist terrorism is not a &quot; clash of civilizations , &quot; but a civil war within Islam . 
A radical minority is using violence to impose a simplified and ideological version on a mainstream with more diverse views . 
While the largest number of Muslims live in Asia , they are influenced by the heart of this struggle in the Middle East , an area that has lagged behind the rest of the world in globalization , openness , institutions , and democratization . 
Here Europe &apos;s economic might and soft power have a lot to contribute . 
More open trade , economic growth , education , development of civil society institutions , and gradual increases in political participation might help strengthen the mainstream over time , as could the way Muslims are treated in Europe and the US . 
The third major determinant of which scenario prevails will be American power and how it is used . 
The US will remain the most powerful country in 2020 , but , paradoxically , the strongest state since the days of Rome will be unable to protect its citizens acting alone . 
American military might is not adequate to deal with threats such as global pandemics , climate change , terrorism , and international crime . 
These issues require cooperation in the provision of global public goods and the soft power of attracting support . 
No part of the world shares more values or has a greater capacity to influence American attitudes and power than does Europe .
