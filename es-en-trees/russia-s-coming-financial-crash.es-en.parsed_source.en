Russia \ u0027s Coming Financial Crash 
WASHINGTON , DC - Today , the whole world is being hit by a tremendous financial crisis , but Russia is facing a perfect storm . 
The Russian stock market is in free fall , plummeting by 60 % since May 19 , a loss of $ 900 billion . 
And the plunge is accelerating . 
One problem is that , after a long period of fiscal prudence , Russia &apos;s government has shown extraordinary ineptitude . 
Russia has enjoyed average annual economic growth of 7 % since 1999 . 
With huge current-account and budget surpluses , it had accumulated international reserves of $ 600 billion by July . 
Its public debt was almost eliminated . 
The initial American financial crisis barely touched Russia , but the global economic slowdown brought about a decline in oil and other commodity prices by more than one-third since July , which was a big blow . 
All the other hits , however , have been self-inflicted . 
The Russian financial crisis is high drama , best described as a tragedy in five acts . 
On July 24 , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin initiated the first act by fiercely attacking , without evidence , the timid owner of the giant coal and steel company Mechel for price-gouging and tax evasion . 
In three days , Mechel &apos;s shares lost half their value , triggering the Russian stock market &apos;s decline . 
Then , on August 8 , Putin launched the second act of this Russian tragedy , his long-planned attack on Georgia . 
Shockingly , Russia argued that it had the right to attack a country that harbored people to whom it had just issued passports , scaring all countries with Russian minorities . 
By recognizing the &quot; independence &quot; of the two occupied territories , Abkhazia and South Ossetia , Russia turned the whole world against it . 
Russia &apos;s leaders have earned a reputation for being unreliable , quixotic , and unpredictable , but markets like trustworthiness , stability , and predictability . 
Not surprisingly , foreign investors no longer favor Putin &apos;s Russia . 
Within a week of its attack on Georgia , Russia recorded a capital outflow of $ 16 billion , which has since increased to $ 30 billion . 
This is a small sum relative to Russia &apos;s currency reserves , but plenty for the underdeveloped banking system , which experienced a severe credit squeeze . 
Putin continues to deny that Russia &apos;s financial problems were caused by his war in Georgia , and it took the Central Bank more than a month to provide substantial liquidity injections . 
Overtly , Russian stock valuations look attractive , but by heaping abuse on foreigners , Putin has scared them away , while Russian investors have no money at hand . 
With every statement , Putin erodes Russia &apos;s political risk profile . 
As is customary , many Russian businessmen pledged their shares to borrow money for stock purchases . 
As the stock market dives , they receive margin calls and are being forced to sell their shares at ever-lower prices , causing the stock market &apos;s downward spiral to accelerate . 
In Soviet fashion , the Moscow stock exchanges closed for four days in a row in the week of September 15 , because stocks plunged too fast . 
By denying the problem , the authorities have aggravated the lack of confidence . 
On international financial markets , the war in Georgia has rendered Russian debt and bonds toxic . 
Interest rates on Russia &apos;s bonds have risen by 2-3 percentage points , and many Russian creditors no longer have access to international capital markets . 
Russia is just about to enter the third act of this tragedy , a banking crisis . 
Numerous medium-sized banks , and some large ones , are set to go under in the stock-market turmoil . 
Too many big investors can no longer meet their margin calls , while borrowing costs have risen sharply . 
The recent appreciation of the dollar adds to their hardship . 
In the fourth act , the real estate bubble will burst . 
A reasonable guess would be that Moscow &apos;s astronomic real-estate prices will fall by at least two-thirds . 
In the fifth act , investment will seize up . 
Why continue building when you can neither finance your investment nor sell real estate ? 
Russian consumers are already scared and will cut their consumption , causing aggregate demand to contract . 
In the end , real economic growth will come to a screeching halt , perhaps as early as next year . 
Other factors are likely to aggravate the situation . 
High-level corruption is so rampant that Russia appears unable to build major public infrastructure projects . 
Oil and other commodity prices are likely to fall further , and oil and gas production have already stagnated . 
Putin has turned his back on the World Trade Organization and is promoting protectionism , which will also harm growth . 
Strangely , the most solid parts of the Russian financial system are the state budget and the currency reserves , but it is too late for them to prevent this tragedy . Neither arbitrary state intervention nor brutality will restore investor confidence . 
The villain in this drama is Vladimir Putin , who has thrived on eight years of rapid growth generated by the market reforms of his predecessor , Boris Yeltsin . 
Russia had a good chance to escape this international financial crisis , but , through his ruthlessness and ineptitude , Putin has rendered his poor country a prime victim . 
How long Russia can afford such an expensive prime minister ?
