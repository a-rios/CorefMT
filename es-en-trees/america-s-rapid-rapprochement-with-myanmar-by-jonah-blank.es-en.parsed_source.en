Obama &apos;s Burmese Gamble 
ARLINGTON - The rapprochement between the United States and Myanmar ( Burma ) has proceeded at a blistering pace . 
A year ago , the two countries did not even have ambassadors in each other &apos;s capitals . 
But has Barack Obama &apos;s administration been too quick to embrace what was , until recently , one of the world &apos;s most repressive regimes ? 
Or , on the contrary , is decisive US support essential to Myanmar &apos;s fledgling reform process ? 
Until the recent opening , Myanmar , which gained independence in 1948 , had been ruled by a secretive military junta since 1962 . 
As recently as 2010 , the regime held elections so blatantly rigged that the main opposition party refused to participate . 
But in 2011 , shortly before assuming the presidency , Sein , a general who served as Prime Minister under the junta , began to take steps that impressed even the most skeptical observers . 
Unlike the token gestures of reform offered by previous rulers , Sein &apos;s actions appeared substantive and meaningful . 
One important change was the release of hundreds of political prisoners , including the regime &apos;s most prominent opponent , Aung San Suu Kyi , who had been under house arrest for nearly 15 years . 
Moreover , Sein initiated a dialogue with Suu Kyi , a Nobel Peace Prize winner and the leader of the National League for Democracy ( NLD ) , about a transition to civilian rule . 
The subsequent elections bolstered hope for Myanmar &apos;s democratic future . 
In 1990 , when the NLD won 81 % of the seats in Parliament , the junta promptly voided the results and arrested Suu Kyi . 
In 2012 , the NLD won 43 of the 44 seats that it contested , and the military accepted Suu Kyi as the reform movement &apos;s legitimate leader . 
Furthermore , Sein has reached out to the Karen , Kachin , and other ethnic minorities - groups whose members have suffered decades of official persecution and mistreatment . 
And efforts to open Myanmar &apos;s economy to international trade have transformed the country &apos;s commercial capital , Yangon ( Rangoon ) , with businesspeople now arriving on direct flights from at least a half-dozen foreign capitals and once-empty streets now congested with imported cars . 
But , in some areas , reform has been painfully slow . 
In fact , when it comes to human rights and minority protections , Myanmar may even be regressing . 
The liberalization process has exposed the country &apos;s long-standing religious divisions , leading to a wave of sectarian violence aimed primarily at the minority Muslim community . 
From coastal Rakhine to inland towns like Meiktila and Tatkon , Buddhist monks have incited violence against Muslims ( and sometimes vice versa ) , with local officials often tacitly permitting religious bloodletting . 
At his meeting with Sein in Washington , DC , Obama condemned the violence against Myanmar &apos;s Muslims , which has displaced many of them . 
On the same day , the US State Department released its annual report on religious freedom , in which Myanmar was included among the world &apos;s eight worst offenders . 
This has not always been the case . 
Although Myanmar is an overwhelmingly Buddhist country , dozens of religious and ethnic communities have long lived there side by side . 
In the heart of Yangon , the golden dome of the Sule Pagoda stands just across the street from the minarets of the Bengali Mosque . 
In order to achieve the peace and stability needed to consolidate Myanmar &apos;s democratic transition , both Sein and Suu Kyi should do more to establish themselves as representatives of all of Myanmar &apos;s citizens . 
Muslims need to be assured of their personal security and guaranteed full civil rights . 
The Obama administration has staked significant political capital on the wager that Myanmar &apos;s promise may finally bear fruit . 
And , indeed , the rate of change in Myanmar over the last two years has been nothing short of remarkable . 
But , as Sein acknowledged at the White House , Myanmar &apos;s government &quot; has been encountering obstacles and challenges along &#91; its &#93; democratization process . &quot; 
How it copes with these problems - and those that have yet to arise - will determine whether America has given its blessing prematurely .
