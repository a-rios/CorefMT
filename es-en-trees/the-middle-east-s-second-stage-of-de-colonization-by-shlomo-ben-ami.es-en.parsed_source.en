Arab States of Uncertainty 
MADRID - The revolutions that swept the Arab world during the last two years have exposed the extraordinary fragility of key Arab states . 
With the exception of historical countries such as Egypt or Morocco , most Arab states are artificial constructs of European colonialism , which combined disparate tribes and ethnicities into unitary states that could be held together only by authoritarian rule and a common enemy - Zionism and its Western patrons . 
Today &apos;s turmoil , however , is no longer driven by anger at foreign forces ; instead , it marks a second phase of the de-colonization process : the assertion of the right of self-determination by peoples and tribes united only by a dictator &apos;s yoke . 
Indeed , it is not entirely farfetched to anticipate the emergence of new Arab states from the debris of the old , artificial ones . 
The American invasion of Iraq set the pattern , for it broke the central government &apos;s power and empowered ethnic and religious enclaves . 
What happened in Yugoslavia , an ill-conceived product of Wilsonian diplomacy , could happen in the more cynical imperial creations in the Middle East . 
What Sigmund Freud defined as &quot; the narcissism of minor differences &quot; caused Yugoslavia to split into seven small states ( including Kosovo ) , following the bloodiest fighting in Europe since World War II . 
Can the Arab states avoid a similar fate ? 
Democratization in the Arab world is not only about toppling dictators ; it is also about redressing the politico-ethnic map of the region , which has kept too many minority groups dissatisfied . 
Consider the Kurds , who were split among Iraq , Turkey , Syria , and Iran . 
Libya was created out of three former Italian colonies , Tripolitania , Cyrenaica , and Fezzan , each essentially comprising different tribal confederations ( the Sa &apos;adi in Cyrenaica , the Saff al-Bahar in Tripolitania , and the Tuareg in Fezzan ) . 
The fall of Muammar el-Qaddafi opened a Pandora &apos;s box of old rivalries , with Cyrenaica developing into a semi-autonomous region known as Barqa . 
Likewise , long-standing tensions between Bahrain &apos;s ruling Sunni minority and Shia majority have worsened since the country &apos;s Shia-led pro-democracy movement was crushed in 2011 . 
As for Jordan , the precarious balance between the Palestinian majority and the Bedouin minority was difficult enough to maintain in stable times ; it is a far more precarious undertaking now . 
Other states in the region have been teetering on the brink of failure from the outset . 
Yemen emerged in 1990 from the reunification of South Yemen and North Yemen , which fought bitter wars in 1972 and 1979 . 
But its leaders have never been able to integrate the tribes , the primary units of Yemen &apos;s social structure , into the political system in a manner that generates their unequivocal acceptance of the sovereign state . 
Syria powerfully demonstrates how a fight against a dictator can soon turn into a sectarian struggle for survival or mastery . 
Notwithstanding the worldwide legitimacy now enjoyed by the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces , a disorderly collapse of the regime might yet lead to the country &apos;s division into autonomous ethnic enclaves . 
The rebels , mostly Sunnis assisted by jihadi groups such as the Nusra Front , an offshoot of Al Qaeda in Iraq , have never truly attempted to reach out to the country &apos;s minorities - Christians , Shia , Druze , and Kurds - which have repudiated the National Coalition as being &quot; obedient to Turkey and Qatar . &quot; 
The Kurds , under the yoke of Arabs , Turks , and Iranians , saw in the demise of Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime in Iraq - and now see in the dismemberment of other Arab autocracies - an opportunity to join the new Great Middle Eastern Game . 
That means realizing the dream of uniting their dispersed nation in an independent Kurdish state . 
The Kurdish militias in northern Syria , which sought to stay out of the civil war while preparing their own autonomous enclave should Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime be toppled , are now being drawn into the fighting ; the Iraqi Kurds , who have been training their Syrian kin , may well follow . 
Turkey inevitably views Kurdish activism in northern Syria - led by the Democratic Union party , an offshoot of the insurgent Kurdistan Workers Party in Turkey - as a direct threat to its stability , and will do its utmost to prevent it from sparking rebellion among Turkey &apos;s own restive Kurdish minority . 
Lebanon is yet another ethnic tapestry that cannot be immune to events in Syria . 
Already , signs of spillover effects can be seen in clashes between Sunni and Alawite militias . 
However hegemonic Hezbollah may now seem , its power in Lebanon depends heavily on the support of the Assad regime . 
Should Assad fall , and the Sunni-led opposition rise to power , the ensuing balance of power in Syria is bound to reshape the balance of power in Lebanon . 
Might South Sudan , the mostly Christian state that seceded in 2011 from the Muslim Arab North after a long civil war , become the new paradigm for non-historical Arab states riven by ethnic and tribal rivalries ? 
As former Prime Minister of China Zhou Enlai supposedly said of the impact of the French Revolution , &quot; It is too early to tell . &quot; 
But there can be no doubt that the post-colonial status quo in the Middle East is crumbling . 
A multifaceted region has yet to crystallize into more definitive political constructions .
