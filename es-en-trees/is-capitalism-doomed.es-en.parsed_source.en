Is Capitalism Doomed ? 
NEW YORK - The massive volatility and sharp equity-price correction now hitting global financial markets signal that most advanced economies are on the brink of a double-dip recession . 
A financial and economic crisis caused by too much private-sector debt and leverage led to a massive re-leveraging of the public sector in order to prevent Great Depression 2.0 . 
But the subsequent recovery has been anemic and sub-par in most advanced economies given painful deleveraging . 
Now a combination of high oil and commodity prices , turmoil in the Middle East , Japan &apos;s earthquake and tsunami , eurozone debt crises , and America &apos;s fiscal problems ( and now its rating downgrade ) have led to a massive increase in risk aversion . 
Economically , the United States , the eurozone , the United Kingdom , and Japan are all idling . 
Even fast-growing emerging markets ( China , emerging Asia , and Latin America ) , and export-oriented economies that rely on these markets ( Germany and resource-rich Australia ) , are experiencing sharp slowdowns . 
Until last year , policymakers could always produce a new rabbit from their hat to reflate asset prices and trigger economic recovery . 
Fiscal stimulus , near-zero interest rates , two rounds of &quot; quantitative easing , &quot; ring-fencing of bad debt , and trillions of dollars in bailouts and liquidity provision for banks and financial institutions : officials tried them all . 
Now they have run out of rabbits . 
Fiscal policy currently is a drag on economic growth in both the eurozone and the UK . 
Even in the US , state and local governments , and now the federal government , are cutting expenditure and reducing transfer payments . 
Soon enough , they will be raising taxes . 
Another round of bank bailouts is politically unacceptable and economically unfeasible : most governments , especially in Europe , are so distressed that bailouts are unaffordable ; indeed , their sovereign risk is actually fueling concern about the health of Europe &apos;s banks , which hold most of the increasingly shaky government paper . 
Nor could monetary policy help very much . 
Quantitative easing is constrained by above-target inflation in the eurozone and UK . 
The US Federal Reserve will likely start a third round of quantitative easing ( QE3 ) , but it will be too little too late . 
Last year &apos;s $ 600 billion QE2 and $ 1 trillion in tax cuts and transfers delivered growth of barely 3 % for one quarter . 
Then growth slumped to below 1 % in the first half of 2011 . 
QE3 will be much smaller , and will do much less to reflate asset prices and restore growth . 
Currency depreciation is not a feasible option for all advanced economies : they all need a weaker currency and better trade balance to restore growth , but they all cannot have it at the same time . 
So relying on exchange rates to influence trade balances is a zero-sum game . 
Currency wars are thus on the horizon , with Japan and Switzerland engaging in early battles to weaken their exchange rates . 
Others will soon follow . 
Meanwhile , in the eurozone , Italy and Spain are now at risk of losing market access , with financial pressures now mounting on France , too . 
But Italy and Spain are both too big to fail and too big to be bailed out . 
For now , the European Central Bank will purchase some of their bonds as a bridge to the eurozone &apos;s new European Financial Stabilization Facility . 
But , if Italy and / or Spain lose market access , the EFSF &apos;s â‚¬ 440 billion ( $ 627 billion ) war chest could be depleted by the end of this year or early 2012 . 
Then , unless the EFSF pot were tripled - a move that Germany would resist - the only option left would become an orderly but coercive restructuring of Italian and Spanish debt , as has happened in Greece . 
Coercive restructuring of insolvent banks &quot; unsecured debt would be next . 
So , although the process of deleveraging has barely started , debt reductions will become necessary if countries cannot grow or save or inflate themselves out of their debt problems . 
So Karl Marx , it seems , was partly right in arguing that globalization , financial intermediation run amok , and redistribution of income and wealth from labor to capital could lead capitalism to self-destruct ( though his view that socialism would be better has proven wrong ) . 
Firms are cutting jobs because there is not enough final demand . 
But cutting jobs reduces labor income , increases inequality and reduces final demand . 
Recent popular demonstrations , from the Middle East to Israel to the UK , and rising popular anger in China - and soon enough in other advanced economies and emerging markets - are all driven by the same issues and tensions : growing inequality , poverty , unemployment , and hopelessness . 
Even the world &apos;s middle classes are feeling the squeeze of falling incomes and opportunities . 
To enable market-oriented economies to operate as they should and can , we need to return to the right balance between markets and provision of public goods . 
That means moving away from both the Anglo-Saxon model of laissez-faire and voodoo economics and the continental European model of deficit-driven welfare states . 
Both are broken . 
The right balance today requires creating jobs partly through additional fiscal stimulus aimed at productive infrastructure investment . 
It also requires more progressive taxation ; more short-term fiscal stimulus with medium- and long-term fiscal discipline ; lender-of-last-resort support by monetary authorities to prevent ruinous runs on banks ; reduction of the debt burden for insolvent households and other distressed economic agents ; and stricter supervision and regulation of a financial system run amok ; breaking up too-big-to-fail banks and oligopolistic trusts . 
Over time , advanced economies will need to invest in human capital , skills and social safety nets to increase productivity and enable workers to compete , be flexible and thrive in a globalized economy . 
The alternative is - like in the 1930s - unending stagnation , depression , currency and trade wars , capital controls , financial crisis , sovereign insolvencies , and massive social and political instability .
