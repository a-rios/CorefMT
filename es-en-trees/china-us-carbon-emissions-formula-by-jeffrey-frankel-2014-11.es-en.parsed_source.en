Emissions Reduction by the Numbers 
CAMBRIDGE - Discussions in Beijing between US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping - the leaders of the world &apos;s two largest carbon-emitting countries - produced an unexpected , groundbreaking bilateral agreement on greenhouse-gas emissions . 
Under the new deal , the US is to reduce its emissions by 26-28 % from 2005 levels within 20 years , and China &apos;s emissions are to peak by 2030 . 
In the absence of a binding global agreement , such unilateral or bilateral commitments by countries to rein in their contribution to global warming represent the most realistic hope for addressing climate change . 
The 1997 Kyoto Protocol marked a major step forward in efforts to head off the most disastrous consequences of climate change , establishing a precedent for legally binding limits on emissions . 
But it lacked commitments by large developing countries , such as China and India , and , largely for that reason , the United States never ratified the treaty . 
A loose system of individual commitments , in which each country unilaterally sets emissions targets , can help build trust and momentum for a more inclusive successor to the Kyoto Protocol , which many hope will be forged at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015 . 
But if such a system is to work , general agreement would need to exist about what constitutes a fair target for each country . 
Then advocacy groups and researchers could compile scorecards that would show which countries are meeting the standard - and shame those that are not . 
At first blush , there would seem to be no agreement on what fair cuts would look like . 
India point outs that an average American emits ten times as much as an average Indian , and argues that emissions allowances should therefore be allocated according to population . 
The US insists that it would be unfair to burden its companies if energy-intensive industries could simply relocate to developing countries that had not yet constrained their emissions . 
Both sides have a point . 
Fortunately , a study of the emissions targets to which countries have already agreed - in Kyoto and at the 2010 UN Climate Change Conference in Cancún - allows us to describe , and even quantify , what has historically been considered fair and reasonable . 
Emission targets implicitly tend to obey a formula that quantifies three major principles : all countries should rein in their emissions , but rich countries should accept bigger cuts than poor countries ; countries where emissions have recently increased rapidly should be given some time to bring them back down ; and no country or group of countries should suffer disproportionately large economic costs . 
In Kyoto , every 10 % increase in per capita income corresponded to an agreed emissions reduction of 1.4 % . 
In Cancún , every 10 % increase in income corresponded to a cut of 1.6 % . 
If this pattern continues through the rest of the century , with emphasis gradually shifting from historic levels to per capita targets , economic models predict that no country need suffer a loss of more than 1 % of GDP in present discounted value ( assuming that market mechanisms such as international trading are allowed ) . 
To be sure , the question of how to share the economic burden of any particular global emissions path is completely different from the question of how environmentally ambitious overall climate-change mitigation efforts should be . 
But , as negotiations proceed , this approach can allow us to evaluate whether the burden of reducing the harmful effects of climate change is being fairly distributed , and to judge whether individual countries are doing their part as they head into the 2014 UN Climate Change Conference in Peru next month . 
The graph below compares the per capita income of countries with the emissions cuts that they have pledged to deliver in 2020 . 
Each country &apos;s cut is measured relative to a particular baseline that averages its actual emissions level in 2005 with emissions expected in 2020 , absent international action .

On average , each 10 % increase in income corresponds with a 1.4 % cut in emissions . 
The fact that countries cluster close to the line indicates that the relationship is statistically significant . 
The graph reveals further interesting insights . 
For example , India &apos;s targets are modest , but also appropriate , given its residents &quot; low income . 
Norway offers the biggest cuts of all . 
Singapore , Turkey , and Moldova appear to be shirkers . 
Most important , the graph allows us to evaluate the targets that China and the US - the two most prominent holdouts from the Kyoto protocol - have proposed . 
As others join China , the US , and the European Union in setting targets for 2030 and beyond , this statistical yardstick for judging fairness can serve as a powerful tool for establishing what share of the burden is appropriate for each country to assume .
