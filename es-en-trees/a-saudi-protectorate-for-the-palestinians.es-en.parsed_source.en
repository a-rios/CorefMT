A Saudi Protectorate for the Palestinians 
From Hosni Mubarak to Ariel Sharon , Middle East leaders are trekking to Washington to discuss restarting the peace process . 
President Bush talks of a Palestinian state and of reforming the Palestinian authority , but ( so far ) offers no road map to achieving either . 
Here Shlomo Avineri , once Director-General of Israel &apos;s Foreign Ministry , proposes an innovative approach to reach both goals . 
Two conflicting needs assail the Middle East . 
The Palestinians must rebuild political structures almost completely destroyed by Israel &apos;s recent incursions into the West Bank . 
Yet it is also clear that the Palestinians are unable to create a polity untainted by terrorism and free of an ideology that violently repudiates Israel &apos;s right to exist . 
After the Oslo agreements were reached a decade ago , supporters of the peace process , in Israel and abroad , hoped that the PLO - an armed national liberation movement deeply enmeshed in terrorism - would transform itself into a responsible and viable political structure . 
Only then would a sovereign Palestinian state be able to live in peace alongside Israel . 
If the ANC could make such a transition in South Africa , why not the Palestinians ? 
The hope that Yasser Arafat might become a Palestinian Nelson Mandela inspired even Israelis skeptical about the Oslo process . 
This was not to be . 
Arafat missed the historic opportunity to achieve a Palestinian state in 2000 when he rejected proposals by President Clinton and then Israeli Premier Barak at Camp David and later in Egypt . 
Instead , he launched an armed intifada , in which competing Palestinian militias unleashed terrorism and suicide attacks against Israeli civilian targets - not only in the occupied territories , but also in Jerusalem , Tel Aviv , Haifa , Hadera , Afula , and Netanya . 
Some militias were under Arafat &apos;s direct control , while others got semi-official support from him , and still others were his antagonists . 
Their common aim was to wrest from a frightened and terrorized Israel what could not be achieved by diplomacy . 
Palestinian territories descended into a lawless chaos reminiscent of Lebanon in the 1970-80 &apos;s . 
Israel will not allow the reconstruction of terrorist structures on its doorstep : no country would . 
But Ariel Sharon &apos;s government should not be allowed to use the Palestinians &apos; utter failure at peaceful nation building as an alibi for continued occupation . 
What , then , is to be done ? 
President Bush &apos;s support for reforming the Palestinian Authority is well intentioned . 
But to imagine a democratic and transparent Palestinian Authority when neither Syria , Egypt nor Saudi Arabia ( or any other Arab country ) show signs of democratization , is a pipe dream . 
Equally well-intentioned UN and EU ideas about introducing an international force to separate Israel and the Palestinians originate with paper-shuffling diplomats , whose previous experiences in peacekeeping ( say , in Srebrenica or Rwanda ) do not inspire confidence . 
Will an international force hunt down suicide bombers ? 
Will it possess intelligence assets and the will to fight if needed ? 
Such a force is dangerous nonsense . 
Palestinian institutions must be rebuilt , but within a legitimate Arab context . 
Like Kosovo and Bosnia , Palestinian territories should be put under an international protectorate , but not 
It should be an Arab one , preferably led by Saudi Arabia . 
A Saudi protectorate over the Palestinians will have internal Arab legitimacy ; it will also possess knowledge and techniques used in the Arab world to ensure security . 
Such a protectorate may not develop a democratic or transparent Palestinian structure . 
But we should forget about that for now anyway . 
What it can do is create a structure untainted by terrorism , suicide bombers and competing militias . 
It may also shield the Palestinians from Israel as it reassures the Israelis that the political entity that will emerge on their doorstep is not going to be another failed quasi-state ruled by warlords and terrorists . 
Far fetched ? 
Perhaps , but so far conventional solutions have proved unworkable , even disastrous . 
After some years of such a Saudi protectorate over the Palestinians , serious negotiations - more or less based on Crown Prince Abdullah &apos;s proposals for an overall agreement - could be re-launched . 
In the meantime , the most urgent priority is a process of de-escalation , stabilization and political consolidation within Palestinian society . 
A Saudi protectorate may be the key to achieving this . 
Everything else having already failed , it may be the only choice left for both Israelis and Palestinians .
