How Capitalist is America ? 
CAMBRIDGE - If capitalism &apos;s border is with socialism , we know why the world properly sees the United States as strongly capitalist . 
State ownership is low , and is viewed as aberrational when it occurs ( such as the government takeovers of General Motors and Chrysler in recent years , from which officials are rushing to exit ) . 
The government intervenes in the economy less than in most advanced nations , and major social programs like universal health care are not as deeply embedded in the US as elsewhere . 
But these are not the only dimensions to consider in judging how capitalist the US really is . 
Consider the extent to which capital - that is , shareholders - rules in large businesses : if a conflict arises between capital &apos;s goals and those of managers , who wins ? 
Looked at in this way , America &apos;s capitalism becomes more ambiguous . 
American law gives more authority to managers and corporate directors than to shareholders . 
If shareholders want to tell directors what to do - say , borrow more money and expand the business , or close off the money-losing factory - well , they just can &apos;t . 
The law is clear : the corporation &apos;s board of directors , not its shareholders , runs the business . 
Someone na√Øve in the ways of US corporations might say that these rules are paper-thin , because shareholders can just elect new directors if the incumbents are recalcitrant . 
As long as they can elect the directors , one might think , shareholders rule the firm . 
That would be plausible if American corporate ownership were concentrated and powerful , with major shareholders owning , say , 25 % of a company &apos;s stock - a structure common in most other advanced countries , where families , foundations , or financial institutions more often have that kind of authority inside large firms . 
But that is neither how US firms are owned , nor how US corporate elections work . 
Ownership in large American firms is diffuse , with block-holding shareholders scarce , even today . 
Hedge funds with big blocks of stock are news , not the norm . 
Corporate elections for the directors who run American firms are expensive . 
Incumbent directors typically nominate themselves , and the company pays their election expenses ( for soliciting votes from distant and dispersed shareholders , producing voting materials , submitting legal filings , and , when an election is contested , paying for high-priced US litigation ) . 
If a shareholder dislikes , say , how GM &apos;s directors are running the company ( and , in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , they were running it into the ground ) , she is free to nominate new directors , but she must pay their hefty elections costs , and should expect that no one , particularly not GM , will ever reimburse her . 
If she owns 100 shares , or 1,000 , or even 100,000 , challenging the incumbents is just not worthwhile . 
Hence , contested elections are few , incumbents win the few that occur , and they remain in control . 
Firms and their managers are subject to competitive markets and other constraints , but not to shareholder authority . 
In lieu of an election that could remove recalcitrant directors , an outside company might try to buy the firm and all of its stock . 
But the rules of the US corporate game - heavily influenced by directors and their lobbying organizations - usually allow directors to spurn outside offers , and even to block shareholders from selling to the outsider . 
Directors lacked that power in the early 1980 &quot; s , when a wave of such hostile takeovers took place ; but by the end of the decade , directors had the rules changed in their favor , to allow them to reject offers for nearly any reason . 
It is now enough to reject the outsider &apos;s price offer ( even if no one else would pay more ) . 
American corporate-law reformers have long had their eyes on corporate elections . 
About a decade ago , after the Enron and WorldCom scandals , America &apos;s stock-market regulator , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , considered requiring that companies allow qualified shareholders to put their director nominees on the company-paid election ballot . 
The actual proposal was anodyne , as it would allow only a few directors - not enough to change a board &apos;s majority - to be nominated , and voted on , at the company &apos;s expense . 
Nevertheless , the directors &quot; lobbying organizations - such as the Business Roundtable and the Chamber of Commerce ( and their lawyers ) - attacked the SEC &apos;s initiative . 
Lobbying was fierce , and is said to have reached into the White House . 
Business interests sought to replace SEC commissioners who wanted the rule , and their lawyers threatened to sue the SEC if it moved forward . 
It worked : America &apos;s corporate insiders repeatedly pushed the proposal off of the SEC agenda in the ensuing decade . 
Then , in the summer of 2010 , after a relevant election and a financial crisis that weakened incumbents &quot; credibility , the SEC promulgated election rules that would give qualified shareholders free access to company-paid election ballots . 
As soon as it did , the US managerial establishment sued the SEC , and government officials felt compelled to suspend the new rules before they ever took effect . 
The litigation is now in America &apos;s courts . 
The lesson is that the US is less capitalist than it is &quot; managerialist . &quot; 
Managers , not owners , get the final say in corporate decisions . 
Perhaps this is good . 
And often the interests of shareholders and managers are aligned . 
But there is considerable evidence that when managers are at odds with shareholders , managerial discretion in American firms is excessive and weakens companies . 
Managers of established firms continue money-losing ventures for too long , pay themselves too much relative to their and the company &apos;s performance , and too often fail to act aggressively enough to enter new but risky markets . 
When it comes to capitalism vs. socialism , we know which side the US is on . 
But when it &apos;s managers vs. capital-owners , the US is managerialist , not capitalist .
