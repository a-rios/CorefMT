Cycling and Cancer 
The cyclist Lance Armstrong recently celebrated an anniversary . 
It has been ten years since he was diagnosed with metastatic testicular cancer , which his doctors believed would kill him . Based on his inspiring story and his efforts to publicize the disease , Armstrong has become an anti-cancer crusader . 
But on examining his foundation &apos;s website ( www.laf.org ) and his writings , a nagging question remains : Did the same tenacity that enabled Armstrong to win seven Tour de France bicycle races help cure his cancer ? 
Armstrong is careful not to equate cycling with cancer , but he - and his legions of fans - often cannot help but do so . 
Such a connection may be highly misleading . 
By his early twenties , Armstrong was becoming a force in the racing world , but all was not well . 
In 1996 , at age 25 , Armstrong developed fatigue , testicular pain and a bloody cough . 
Doctors diagnosed him with testicular cancer . 
He was given roughly a 40 % chance of survival , which was probably an overestimate . 
One doctor told Armstrong &apos;s mother that her son would die . 
After undergoing surgery to remove his cancerous testicle , Armstrong became &quot; a student of cancer . &quot; 
He was treated at Indiana University , perhaps America &apos;s leading center for testicular cancer . 
Armstrong chose Indiana because its oncologists said they could treat him without bleomycin , a type of chemotherapy that would have damaged his lungs and ended his cycling career if he survived . 
They removed his brain tumors with surgery instead of radiation , which might have caused balance problems . 
But the doctors made no bones about what Armstrong was to receive : extremely caustic drugs that would make him sick as a dog . 
Armstrong later wrote that &quot; by the fourth cycle &#91; of chemotherapy &#93; , I was in the fetal position , retching around the clock . &quot; 
Armstrong &apos;s cancer responded extremely well . 
He then underwent extensive rehabilitation , gradually regaining strength and confidence . 
By 1998 , he was again riding his bicycle . 
The illness changed Armstrong &apos;s body . 
When he resumed serious training , he was leaner and more muscular . 
In addition to the emotional advantage that Armstrong believed that cancer gave him , his new body also made him a more effective cyclist . 
In 1999 , less than three years after his diagnosis , Armstrong won his first Tour de France . 
Six more followed , making him the greatest cyclist in history . 
For his part , Armstrong has tried to steer clear of facile associations between his Tour de France triumphs and his recovery from cancer . 
&quot; Good , strong people get cancer , &quot; he has written , &quot; and they do all the right things to beat it , and they still die . &quot; 
Perhaps he was a racing hero , Armstrong has stated , but &quot; it wasn &apos;t heroic to survive cancer . &quot; 
Even though he participated in his care and had excellent doctors , his survival was &quot; more a matter of blind luck . &quot; 
Still , at times , Armstrong seems to slip into the sort of language he wishes to avoid . 
At the close of his second book , Armstrong summarized his history with cancer as : &quot; I got treated , I fought like hell , and I got better . &quot; 
A quotation on his foundation &apos;s website reads &quot; When I was sick , I didn &apos;t want to die . 
When I race I don &apos;t want to lose . 
Dying and losing , it &apos;s the same thing . &quot; 
More worrisome is the adoption of the same reasoning by those who hear Armstrong &apos;s story . 
&quot; Lance refused to become a statistic and instead rallied and became cancer &apos;s worst enemy , &quot; wrote a reviewer of his first book . 
&quot; He refused to give in and chose to fight the disease with all he had . &quot; 
An Internet biography states that &quot; with the same fierce focus he brings to competition , &quot; Armstrong &quot; tackled his illness and won . &quot; 
To some people , Armstrong has become a symbol for the notion that anything is possible . 
&quot; Lance beat cancer and then he went on to win 5 Tour de Frances , &quot; a computer programmer wrote on his blog in 2003 . 
&quot; That pretty much means I can overcome whatever ills I have in my life so I can keep going after that . &quot; 
The trouble is that data about the &quot; will to live &quot; among cancer patients are not so rosy . 
One 1989 study showed that women with metastatic breast cancer who attended support groups survived longer , but these results have not been duplicated . 
A recent study showed that a positive attitude did not lengthen the lives of lung cancer patients . 
Anecdotally , clinicians can recall &quot; fighters &quot; with cancer who die and others who &quot; give up &quot; but live . 
This is a sobering message for Armstrong &apos;s many fans . 
After all , we all want to think that hard work always pays off . 
Unfortunately , in the world of cancer , this may not be so . 
But Armstrong &apos;s legacy is about more than data . 
He has educated and provided inspiration to thousands , perhaps millions , of cancer patients and raised money that is being used to finding cures . 
Oh , and there are those seven bike races that he won .
