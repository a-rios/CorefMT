Hamas , Fatah , and the Palestinian Dilemma 
GAZA CITY - With dueling authorities running Gaza and the West Bank , the Palestinian people find themselves in the middle of an experiment . 
In Gaza , where Hamas is in charge , the high price of armed resistance to Israel has discredited any attempts to revive the conflict . 
In the West Bank , under Fatah rule , negotiations have gone nowhere . 
Neither track of Palestinian politics - resistance or negotiation - offers hope of achieving independence . 
As a result , Palestinians face their most difficult challenge since 1948 . 
Israeli threats of renewing its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip are taken very seriously . 
The scenes of devastation are still vivid in the streets and neighborhoods of Gaza , and Hamas is taking no chances of provoking Israel into a new war . 
The fighting cost Hamas two of its top leaders , Saeed Siyam and Nizar Rayan , and significantly weakened its military capabilities . 
Only recently have these been rebuilt . 
Hamas finds itself in a difficult position , since its policy calls for strong resistance , alongside politics . 
Yet this policy has failed . 
Hamas has put pressure on all resistance groups in Gaza to refrain from provoking Israel . 
In an unprecedented statement , Mahmoud al-Zahar , a top Hamas leader , said any missiles fired at Israel from Gaza would be &quot; betrayal missiles . &quot; 
Instead , Hamas has turned its attention to the West Bank , where it has no political authority . 
It has called on Palestinians there to launch a new intifada against Israel , even while insisting on calm in the Gaza Strip . 
Fatah , which runs the West Bank , wants no part of another Palestinian uprising . 
President Mahmoud Abbas has made no secret of his objection to such a strategy . 
But , with their government unable to do anything about the expansion of Israeli settlements , including in East Jerusalem , as well as continued conflicts over holy sites in Hebron , Bethlehem , and the Al-Aksa mosque , West Bank Palestinians are extremely frustrated . 
Recent street demonstrations could easily turn into an outbreak of ongoing resistance to Israeli rule . 
The Palestinian Authority , which runs the West Bank , is afraid that a popular , non-violent intifada might quickly turn violent . 
If so , Israel might use it as a pretext to crush the Palestinians and their newly built institutions . 
This has happened before , during the last intifada in 2002 . 
There is another scenario that also terrifies Fatah leaders . 
An outbreak of violence could strengthen Hamas and its military wing , Al-Qassam Brigades , in the West Bank . 
This , in turn , could produce a repeat of the scenario that brought Hamas to power in Gaza in June 2007 , when all Fatah authority in the area collapsed after the Israeli withdrawal . 
Yet the peace process has been stalled for more than a year , greatly reducing Fatah &apos;s credibility in the West Bank . 
Abbas has repeatedly described peace as a strategic choice for the Palestinians . 
But , 17 years since the signing of the Oslo agreement and the launch of bilateral talks between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel , there has been very little movement toward a Palestinian state . 
In popular opinion , negotiations have reached a dead end . 
Arab diplomats also show few signs of optimism . 
At its recent summit in Libya , the Arab League rejected the proximity talks proposed by the United States &quot; Middle East peace envoy , George Mitchell . 
The Arab position is that no proximity talks can be held until Israel freezes its settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem . 
Palestinian and Arab opinion is waiting for the US , as Israel &apos;s ally , to intervene and press for concessions . 
Though the Palestinian economy in the West Bank has improved greatly under Prime Minister Salam Fayyad , this is no substitute for serious peace negotiations . 
In August 2009 , Fayyad declared his vision of a Palestinian state in two years . 
Under his blueprint , which has received strong financial support from the US and the European Union , the political , economic , and security infrastructure of the Palestinian state would be ready by August 2011 . 
Fayyad has also gained the backing of Fatah and most other Palestinian groups in the West Bank . 
Fayyad &apos;s strategy for international recognition of a Palestinian state is to fight a legal battle against Israel in the United Nations Security Council and other international bodies . 
He is convinced that establishing a Palestinian state would serve the interest of all parties , and that the odds favor the Palestinians in international political struggle . 
Hamas does not share this view , and Palestinian reconciliation efforts have reached an impasse . 
The Arab League has given Egypt the lead role in bringing the two sides together , but Hamas has spurned Egypt &apos;s proposals . 
Now , with questions about President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s successor in the air , Egypt has put aside these talks . 
Palestinians are looking instead to Iran , Hamas &quot; ally , for signs of any revival in discussions between Fatah and Hamas . 
Palestinians &quot; choices are limited , and there is no consensus among them on how to proceed . 
But there is a growing sense that the waiting game cannot last much longer . Whatever comes next will most likely come soon .
