Good and Bad Inequality 
PRINCETON - In the pantheon of economic theories , the tradeoff between equality and efficiency used to occupy an exalted position . 
The American economist Arthur Okun , whose classic work on the topic is called Equality and Efficiency : The Big Tradeoff , believed that public policies revolved around managing the tension between those two values . 
As recently as 2007 , when New York University economist Thomas Sargent , addressing the graduating class at the University of California , Berkeley , summarized the wisdom of economics in 12 short principles , the tradeoff was among them . 
The belief that boosting equality requires sacrificing economic efficiency is grounded in one of the most cherished ideas in economics : incentives . 
Firms and individuals need the prospect of higher incomes to save , invest , work hard , and innovate . 
If taxation of profitable firms and rich households blunts those prospects , the result is reduced effort and lower economic growth . 
Communist countries , where egalitarian experiments led to economic disaster , long served as &quot; Exhibit A &quot; in the case against redistributive policies . 
In recent years , however , neither economic theory nor empirical evidence has been kind to the presumed tradeoff . 
Economists have produced new arguments showing why good economic performance is not only compatible with distributive fairness , but may even demand it . 
For example , in high-inequality societies , where poor households are deprived of economic and educational opportunities , economic growth is depressed . 
Then there are the Scandinavian countries , where egalitarian policies evidently have not stood in the way of economic prosperity . 
Early this year , economists at the International Monetary Fund produced empirical results that seemed to upend the old consensus . 
They found that greater equality is associated with faster subsequent medium-term growth , both across and within countries . 
Moreover , redistributive policies did not appear to have any detrimental effects on economic performance . 
We can have our cake , it seems , and eat it , too . 
That is a striking result - all the more so because it comes from the IMF , an institution hardly known for heterodox or radical ideas . 
Economics is a science that can claim to have uncovered few , if any , universal truths . 
Like almost everything else in social life , the relationship between equality and economic performance is likely to be contingent rather than fixed , depending on the deeper causes of inequality and many mediating factors . 
So the emerging new consensus on the harmful effects of inequality is as likely to mislead as the old one was . 
Consider , for example , the relationship between industrialization and inequality . 
In a poor country where the bulk of the workforce is employed in traditional agriculture , the rise of urban industrial opportunities is likely to produce inequality , at least during the early stages of industrialization . 
As farmers move to cities and earn higher pay , income gaps open up . 
In China , for example , rapid economic growth after the late 1970s was associated with a significant rise in inequality . 
Roughly half of the increase was the result of urban-rural earnings gaps , which also acted as the engine of growth . 
Or consider transfer policies that tax the rich and the middle classes in order to increase the income of poor households . 
Many countries in Latin America , such as Mexico and Bolivia , undertook such policies in a fiscally prudent manner , ensuring that government deficits would not lead to high debt and macroeconomic instability . 
On the other hand , Venezuela &apos;s aggressive redistributive transfers under Hugo Chávez and his successor , Nicolás Maduro , were financed by temporary oil revenues , placing both the transfers and macroeconomic stability at risk . 
Even though inequality has been reduced in Venezuela ( for the time being ) , the economy &apos;s growth prospects have been severely weakened . 
Latin America is the only world region where inequality has declined since the early 1990s . Improved social policies and increased investment in education have been substantial factors . 
But the decline in the pay differential between skilled and unskilled workers - what economists call the &quot; skill premium &quot; - has also played an important role . 
Whether this is good news or bad for economic growth depends on why the skill premium has fallen . 
If pay differentials have narrowed because of an increase in the relative supply of skilled workers , we can be hopeful that declining inequality in Latin America will not stand in the way of faster growth ( and may even be an early indicator of it ) . 
In the advanced countries , the causes of rising inequality are still being debated . 
Automation and other technological changes , globalization , weaker trade unions , erosion of minimum wages , financialization , and changing norms about acceptable pay gaps within enterprises have all played a role , with different weights in the United States relative to Europe . 
Each one of these drivers has a different effect on growth . 
While technological progress clearly fosters growth , the rise of finance since the 1990s has probably had an adverse effect , via financial crises and the accumulation of debt . 
It is good that economists no longer regard the equality-efficiency tradeoff as an iron law . 
We should not invert the error and conclude that greater equality and better economic performance always go together . 
After all , there really is only one universal truth in economics : It depends .
