Chávismo After Chávez 
CARACAS - With the death of Hugo Chávez , Chávismo has lost its supremacy in Venezuela . 
It does not matter that so-called Chávistas still control Venezuela &apos;s parliament , 17 of 23 provincial governments , and all key state institutions , including the judiciary . 
Nor does it matter that Chávez &apos;s handpicked successor , Nicolás Maduro , has already assumed the presidency . 
All of the signs point to the decline of Chávismo and to the end of Venezuela &apos;s role as Latin America &apos;s populist core . 
Between last October &apos;s presidential election and the one held last month , Chávismo lost almost 700,000 votes to Henrique Capriles &quot; Democratic Unity Roundtable - a shift that many , including Chávistas , attribute to &quot; Maduro not being Chávez . &quot; 
This was the first presidential election in Venezuela that resulted in an almost even split among voters ( and the outcome itself remains hotly contested ) . 
If Venezuela continues along this path , Chávismo could not only lose its majority ; it could collapse altogether . 
Maduro &apos;s poor performance reflects his squandering of Chávez &apos;s electoral capital . 
More important , it has deepened doubt that he will be able to perform two crucial functions of Chávismo , one related to Cuba and the other a more nationalist , less &quot; anti-capitalist &quot; purpose connected to unnamed yet powerful military figures . 
Chávez &apos;s connections with Cuba were an important factor in his choice of Maduro - a Marxist tutored by Fidel and Raúl Castro - as his heir . 
More than a decade ago , Cuba saw in Chávez a way to drive Latin American populism in three main ways : establish North American imperialism and the local &quot; oligarchies &quot; as common enemies ; lock in the support of the uneducated and deprived underclass ; and erode the bases of viable opposition . 
Curiously , many of the young democracies born after the ignominy of the right-wing military regimes of the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s define themselves according to Cuba &apos;s long-lasting communist dictatorship . 
Tempted by the idea of endless re-election and absolute authority , Bolivia &apos;s Evo Morales , Ecuador &apos;s Rafael Correa , Nicaragua &apos;s Daniel Ortega , and Argentina &apos;s Cristina Fernández de Kirchner all indulge and support each other , with the economically and ideologically powerful Venezuela playing an important synthesizing role . 
But Venezuela &apos;s election may have changed all that . 
Given that Maduro cannot retain Chávez &apos;s existing supporters , he is clearly not a candidate for regional leadership . 
In fact , with Chávismo losing ground , Cuba will struggle to maintain its political influence in Venezuela - and thus the economic sinecures ( including heavily subsidized oil ) on which it depends . Moreover , it will not be easy for Cuba to find a new leader to champion its absolutist ideology across Latin America . Fernández is occupied with Argentina &apos;s internal problems . 
Correa &apos;s Ecuador lacks economic weight , and former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is probably not interested , with Brazil &apos;s growing economic and political clout having placed it out of Cuba &apos;s reach . 
With little hope of restoring Venezuela &apos;s regional authority , Maduro will have to focus on safeguarding his tenuous leadership position at home . 
This means that forging a strong partnership with the military is essential . 
The military embodies the most extreme institutional transformation that Chávez achieved in Venezuela . 
Under his leadership , what was once an apolitical and non-deliberative institution - as is standard in a democracy - became the engine of Chávez &apos;s &quot; twenty-first-century socialism . &quot; 
Just as the Argentine working class formed Juan Perón &apos;s electoral base 70 years ago , Venezuela &apos;s armed forces served as Chávez &apos;s most steadfast supporters , executing his authority throughout the country under the motto , &quot; Country , socialism , or death . &quot; 
As Chávez &apos;s health deteriorated , however , so did the motto &apos;s significance . 
But the overwhelming military presence in government ministries and institutions , state-owned companies , provincial governments , and private businesses remains intact . 
The military has effectively achieved a coup d &quot; état without any struggle . 
Maduro seems to have the military &apos;s support - at least for now . 
Whether or not the partnership lasts will depend on how Maduro tackles Venezuela &apos;s many problems , including high inflation , a soaring crime rate , pervasive corruption , economic stagnation , low productivity , supply shortages , capital flight , insufficient investment , weak institutions , and a lack of respect for the rule of law . 
But Maduro must act fast . 
He will not be granted the 100-day &quot; honeymoon &quot; period that new governments typically receive to revise their predecessors &quot; policies and , presumably , to correct their errors , because his administration is a continuation of Chávez &apos;s 14-year presidency . 
Moreover , Maduro has already been the head of Venezuela &apos;s executive for almost 180 days , first as Vice President , then as acting president , and now as the country &apos;s elected leader . 
Given this , Maduro cannot leave any issues unacknowledged or blame them on his predecessor . 
At the same time , it will be difficult to address Venezuela &apos;s problems effectively without Chávez &apos;s electoral support , rhetorical talent , and charisma . 
To be sure , Chávismo endures . 
Indeed , it still represents roughly half of Venezuela &apos;s electorate . 
But the rest of the population cannot and should not be ignored . 
If Maduro fails to recognize this and act accordingly , he will lose the military &apos;s support - and Venezuelans could lose their republic . 
Such an outcome would have serious consequences for Latin America .
