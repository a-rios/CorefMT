A Misaligned Euro ? 
CAMBRIDGE : Caught by rising inflation from oil prices and a soaring dollar , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) has raised interest rates yet another notch . 
More is to come . 
Growth is wonderful ; inflation is terrible ; a central bank cannot avoid choosing : it must restore price stability even if that means sacrificing growth . 
This is what lies ahead , unless there is sudden relief from an upturn in the euro . 
But is it realistic to expect a rally from a currency that has been under siege since its birth ? 
At its introduction the euro reached impressive heights , like a high-tech IPO . 
But the IPO soon sunk miserably . 
Since its introduction , the euro has fallen further from its peak then even the Nasdaq in the high-tech sell-off of earlier this year . 
Like the Nasdaq &apos;s high-tech high-flyers , the nagging questions about the euro are these : what is its fundamental value ? 
Is there a fundamental misalignment of the euro with other currencies ( most notably the dollar ) and how long might this last ? 
It is commonly assumed ( but nobody takes big bets ) that the Nasdaq still carries major downside risks while the euro , sooner or later , must return to normality , whatever that means . 
Could the opposite happen ? 
A recent study by the IMF reports on &quot; equilibrium &quot; exchange rates derived from models of long run factors in currency valuations . 
The equilibrium rates are reported in the accompanying table and so are today &apos;s actual rates . 
According to these IMF theoretical equilibrium rates , the euro is grossly misaligned : 30 % underpriced against the dollar , 18 % against the Yen ! 
Dollar / Euro ( $ / _ ) 0.88 1.26 
Yen / Euro ( - / _ ) 93.1 113.3  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  
First and most importantly , these equilibrium rates are based on a theoretical model where long run current account balances tend toward zero . 
Under this scenario , any country that runs persistent , large current account balances must look forward to a hard landing and a correction in the value of its currency . 
No country can borrow forever or at least at very high rates . 
But do current account constraints apply to major , financially stable countries ? 
Canada has run current account deficits for all but three of the last 50 years ; the US has done the same for 30 years . 
So long as a borrowing country is stable and attractive , a major reversal due to the current account balance will not be forced by the market . 
That is America &apos;s story : despite a yawning trade deficit , investment is running high , eagerly financed by the rest of the world ; public finance is formidable and inflation insignificant ; new economy prospects run unabated and asset markets are revealing that even if there is a US bubble , it is unlikely to burst as violently as in Japan a decade ago . 
In such an environment , long run equilibrium rate models are pretty useless as guides to short or even medium term exchange rate developments . 
The second limitation of long run models is this : they are estimated from history and so make no allowance for dramatic changes in the supply side or financial environment . 
Japan , for example , is in the grip of a growth crisis and public finance disaster - not the usual companions of an appreciating currency . 
On the dollar / euro front , the US has embarked on a high productivity trend unmatched anywhere ; never mind the current account , the upswing in American productivity ( combined with financial stability ) is the dominant feature no matter the current account . 
The counterpart of here , because exchange rates always ride on differential performance , is a continued poor supply side performance in Europe and Japan &apos;s ongoing and pervasive economic distress . 
There is a third reason why estimates of long run equilibrium with current account balance may be of little predictive value . 
Do Europe and Japan really want to see the US achieve an external balance ? 
Europe and Japan , indeed the whole emerging economy world , are living off America &apos;s trade deficits . 
They keep the world growing ! 
Were there a risk to the continued funding of these deficits by the private sector , the ECB and the Bank of Japan would step in to buy all the dollars that their private sectors had shunned . 
There is precedent for this : whenever the dollar weakens , foreign central banks are eager to help . 
As John Connally , President Nixon &apos;s Treasury Secretary of 30 years ago , said : &quot; the dollar is our money and their problem . &quot; 
The chance of seeing exchange rates near the IMF values any time soon is slim . 
But it is also plausible that lack of support for the euro and the ongoing US miracle will see the euro sink to exceptionally low levels of near .80 and even less . 
For the time being , investors will continue to think of the euro as a problem just as the ECB does . 
The euro IPO crashed because it came at a time when the US economy was flying high . 
The European product is going to make it ; it will have its day in the sun .
