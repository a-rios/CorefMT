Economic Reality Fights Back 
Almost every day , we learn of yet another greedy US corporate chief executive who conspired with accountants , lawyers , and investment bankers to defraud the investing public . 
But beyond the scandals , the public should be more aware of the erratic nature of today &apos;s financial markets . 
Exchange rates and stock market prices deviate enormously from long-run fundamental values , which can cause major dislocations in the real economy of jobs , production , and investment . 
And yet the financial analysts that discuss these trends in the media have failed to assess them realistically . 
Take the case of the US dollar , whose value against the Euro is now plummeting . 
From the mid-1990s until very recently , the dollar strengthened sharply against European currencies . 
When the Euro was introduced in January 1999 , it traded at $ 1.17 . 
It then steadily lost value , bottoming out at around $ 0.83 , before climbing back in recent days to near-parity with the dollar . 
For academic economists , the Euro &apos;s recent rise is no surprise . 
Currency exchange rates have a tendency to return to long-run average values following large deviations . 
Thus , the enormous strength of the dollar in recent years implied an eventual reversal . 
That reversal is now underway . 
Of course , if two economies have persistently different rates of inflation , then the exchange rate between their currencies will not tend to return to its historic level . 
But US and European inflation rates have been roughly the same . 
It is also possible that the exchange rate will not return to the long-run average if one economy is hit by a huge structural change . 
But such changes occur less frequently than is often supposed or alleged . 
The past , if interpreted with care , therefore remains a good guide to the future . 
Listening to the financial pundits , however , it often seems that history no longer matters . 
When the dollar strengthened against the Euro after 1999 , the investment analysts came up with one explanation after another for why the trend would continue . 
They hailed the strength of the US economy , bemoaned the alleged weaknesses of the European economy , and claimed that the Euro was mismanaged . 
In short , they over-interpreted short-term market movements , simplistically portraying them as long-term trends . 
Unfortunately , financial analysts are usually poorly trained in economics . 
Their job is to say something clever for the television cameras . 
They do not trade on fundamental information , but on the latest gossip and fads . 
Of course , if such fads are common , and if they do not last forever , a smart investor can profit handsomely from them , say , by selling the dollar short in recent months . 
Some investors do succeed at this , but it is tougher than it sounds . 
As the great British economist John Maynard Keynes warned seventy-five years ago , &quot; markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent . &quot; 
In other words , even if you know that the dollar will eventually fall , you could go bankrupt before you can prove your case if everyone else continues betting that it will rise . 
So it is often safer to run with the crowd , even if you think the crowd is running in the wrong direction . 
For the same reason , Keynes famously described the stock market as a beauty contest in which each judge chooses not the most beautiful contestant according to his own views , but rather the contestant that he believes will be chosen by the other judges ! 
Indeed , when US equity prices reached astronomical levels in the late 1990s , the pundits and investment bankers trotted out their silly explanations and theories . 
We now know that some of those explanations were deliberately fraudulent . 
Many brokerages sought to boost investment banking fees from companies whose shares they pushed on an unwitting public . 
But more generally , the pundits simply ran with the crowd . 
As equity prices soared , they invented theories to justify the rise . 
Deeper analysis would have told them instead that the rise would be short-lived . 
A few analysts got it right . 
Economist Robert Schiller of Yale explained very clearly and at book length why US equity prices would fall . 
Leading economic columnist Martin Wolf of the Financial Times distinguished himself again by warning , stubbornly and correctly , that the US stock market would eventually reverse to more normal historical levels . 
But the real economic costs imposed by the crowd mentality have been high . 
The excessive boom of the US stock market led to over-investment in the United States and a subsequent US recession when the bubble finally burst . 
The strength of the dollar has similarly distorted investment decisions , and the same kinds of exaggerated swings in exchange rates in emerging markets have contributed to the boom-bust cycles in Asia and Latin America in the past five years . 
So what should be done ? 
Clearly , the leading investment banks should become much more serious about training and licensing their analysts to provide knowledge rather than nonsense in their public pronouncements . 
The responsible media should scrutinize economic trends critically , rather than pandering to mass opinion . 
And academic economists should be more steadfast in explaining how financial market prices reflect fundamental economic values , even if this is not necessarily true in the short term . 
Finally , tightened financial market regulation could perhaps slow some of the hot-money flows that exaggerate the booms and busts . 
Alas , Keynes stressed these same deficiencies long ago , so we should not expect any miraculous changes in behavior now . 
Investor , beware !
