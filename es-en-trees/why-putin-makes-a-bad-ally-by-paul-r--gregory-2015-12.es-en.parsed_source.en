Why Putin Makes a Bad Ally 
STANFORD - Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s intervention in the Syrian conflict has been welcomed by some as a moment for the Kremlin to &quot; come in from the cold . &quot; 
Russia &apos;s conflict with the Islamic State , the argument goes , has aligned the country &apos;s interests with those of the West . 
Even Turkey &apos;s downing of a Russian warplane does not seem not to have deflated this optimism . 
Indeed , at a recent press conference , US President Barack Obama again urged Putin to join the alliance against the Islamic State . 
At first blush , the idea that Russia is a natural ally against Islamist terrorists seems to make sense . 
The country has suffered horrific terrorist attacks by Islamist extremists , including the bombing in November of a plane above the Sinai Peninsula , which killed 224 passengers and crew , nearly all of them Russian . 
Around 20 million Muslims , most of them Sunni , live within the Russian Federation , and the country &apos;s security officials report that some 7,000 fighters from the former Soviet republics and Russia have joined the Islamic State . 
On deeper examination , however , it becomes clear that an anti-terror alliance with Russia is wishful thinking . 
Putin has not gone into Syria to defeat the Islamic State . 
He has intervened to save the regime of Russia &apos;s client , Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . 
Putin may sometimes give the appearance that he is ready to abandon Assad , but ultimately he will defend him . 
Leaving Assad to his fate would be a sign of weakness - and thus anathema to Putin . 
Ordinary Russians may be in danger of attacks by Islamic extremists , but they pose little threat to Putin or his allies . 
Russia has indeed suffered a number of terrorist attacks , including the 2004 Beslan massacre , in which 334 people , most of them schoolchildren , were killed . 
In nearly every case , the response to the attacks was brutal , inept , and costly in terms of civilian lives lost . 
Indeed , terrorist attacks at the turn of the century solidified public opinion against Chechen rebels and gave Putin the public support he needed to raze Grozny , Chechnya &apos;s capital . 
Putin &apos;s confidence in dealing with terrorism reflects the design of Russia &apos;s security state . 
Russia spends more on internal security than it does on national defense . 
It has interior ministry troops , federal security agency ( FSB ) special forces , OMON ( mobile special service ) troops , military intelligence troops , and a vast network of internal spies and informants . 
Regime opponents are not allowed to run for office , their rights to demonstrate are restricted , and they are subject to a legal arbitrariness in the courts . 
Citizens have virtually no protection from wiretaps or the interception of their electronic communications . 
Every society must balance civil rights against national security . 
Putin &apos;s Russia has swung to one extreme of the spectrum , while the United States and Europe ( despite the protests of civil libertarians ) have chosen to occupy the other end . 
Indeed , Russia is an example of the upper limit of what state power can do to control terrorist activity . 
It would be a rare extremist group that had not been infiltrated with an informant who reports to Moscow . 
There is even evidence that those who carried out the Beslan massacre were infiltrated by Russian intelligence . 
Moreover , any terrorist group knows that their operations will be met with the most extreme use of force . 
In Beslan , for example , Russian special forces used thermobaric weapons . 
As the reaction to the attacks in Paris illustrates , the seemingly random murder of 130 civilians has monumental resonance in the West - especially when the religious and ideological motives are difficult to understand . 
In Putin &apos;s calculations , the loss of lives in extremist attacks is unwelcome , but ultimately acceptable if it does not threaten the regime . 
The Russian people might be horrified and frightened . 
Working with the West to combat the Islamic State serves neither of those purposes .
