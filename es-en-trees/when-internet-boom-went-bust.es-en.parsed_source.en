When Internet Boom Went Bust 
While the internet boom lasted , nothing seemed able to deflate the bubble . 
Few internet and dot com companies were profitable , but investors never seemed to mind . 
They looked at the number of customers or subscribers as the basis for valuing internet stocks . 
The name of the game became raising capital , not making profits . 
Even when fashionable stocks dipped , there was remarkably little effect on the rest of the market . 
People had learned that it pays to buy the dips , and were not weaned from the habit until it ceased to pay . 
Now that internet fever has abated , we hear that the &quot; fundamentals &quot; are reasserting themselves . 
But this view is as much a half-truth as the previous notion that the boom would last forever because the internet economy had created new fundamentals . 
Indeed , the internet boom / bust cycle brings into question prevailing economic theories about financial markets . 
What should now be clear is that the so-called fundamentals that supposedly determine stock prices are not independently given . 
Instead , they are contingent on the behavior of financial markets . 
There are , indeed , myriad ways in which stock prices affect the fortunes of companies : they determine the cost of equity capital ; they decide whether a company will be taken over or acquire other companies ; stock prices influence a company &apos;s capacity to borrow and its ability to attract and reward management through stock options ; stock prices serve as an advertising and marketing tool . 
In other words , when financial markets believe a company is doing well , its &quot; fundamentals &quot; improve ; when markets change their mind , the actual fortunes of the company change with them . 
Moreover , changes in financial markets also have far reaching macroeconomic consequences . 
It did not take a genius to realize that the internet boom , based not on profit expectations but on the expectations of selling stock to the public at ever increasing prices , rested on an unsustainable business model . 
It also did not take a genius to see that boom would be followed by bust , but it was harder to guess when that bust would occur . 
In the summer of 1999 I was convinced that an internet crash was imminent . 
Yet internet stocks recovered from a short dip ; some soon rose to new highs . 
Institutions that live and die by relative performance felt obliged to increase their internet holdings . 
When Yahoo was included in the S &amp; P 500 Index , it jumped 30 % in a day . 
People like me who had sold internet stocks short in the belief that a crash was imminent were forced to cover them at whopping losses . 
I remained convinced that a bust was bound to come , but I could not afford to stand by my convictions . 
Despite its irrational aspects , the internet boom was more than a matter of inflated valuations . 
The optimism of the financial markets not only changed the &quot; fundamentals &quot; of individual businesses , it had real and profound effects throughout the whole economy . 
The boom did not only follow from the development of the internet ; it accelerated that development and contributed to the speed and extension of technological innovation . 
The same was true in telecommunications , where the boom also accelerated the spread of new technology . 
The internet bust , when it finally came , was caused not by an unsound business model , but by over-extension of credit . 
The present slowdown is affecting the fundamentals of individual companies almost as much as their stock prices ; it also affects the financial system and macroeconomic performance . 
Instead of a one-way connection in which financial markets discount the future more or less accurately , there exists a two-way connection in which financial markets shape the future they are supposed to discount . 
Instead of a single outcome , there is a range of possibilities . 
Which of those possibilities materializes depends not only on the future evolution of the so-called fundamentals but on financial market behavior as well . 
In these circumstances , it is irrational for market participants to base their decisions solely on their expectations about fundamentals because the fundamentals do not determine market prices ; on the contrary , they are shaped by market conditions . 
So what matters to market participants is the future course of market prices , not the fundamentals they are said to reflect . 
If market prices deviate from a theoretical equilibrium there can be no assurance that they will ever return to it . 
This is why the recent boom / bust sequence in internet and telecommunication stocks is so revealing . 
These developments cannot be explained in terms of efficient markets and rational expectations . 
I have proposed an alternative explanation based on the two-way connection between fundamentals and valuations which I call &quot; reflexivity . &quot; 
I am amazed and amused that economists ignore my arguments . 
They claim that the phenomenon of reflexivity is already taken into account in the concept of multiple equilibria which has gained acceptance recently . 
Maybe so , but I have yet to see how persistent movements away from a theoretical equilibrium can be explained within the framework of multiple equilibria . 
Any divergence from equilibrium , whether one assumes that there is a unique equilibrium or many equilibria , amounts to more than noise ; it is a causal factor in determining the very nature of the &quot; equilibrium &quot; that will prevail . 
By ignoring this condition , efficient market theory presents a totally misleading picture of financial markets . 
Why is my reasoning dismissed out of hand ? 
Because it leads to the conclusion that financial markets are inherently unpredictable . 
What is the value of a scientific theory , I am asked , if it does not yield useable predictions ? 
I contend that it would be better to recognize the uncertainties inherent in the behavior of financial markets than to cling to a supposedly scientific theory that distorts reality . 
One consequence of the realization that financial markets are potentially unstable , is a recognition of the need for financial authorities to make it their business to prevent excesses . 
The debate about efficient markets may be arcane , but the consequences for our lives are very real indeed .
