Europe &apos;s Squandered Minority 
BUDAPEST - Today , millions of Europeans are afraid and frustrated as they face unemployment , loss of savings and pensions , radically reduced social benefits , and other economic hardships . 
Their fears are warranted , because the current financial crisis is undermining the very union that was established to heal Europe &apos;s wounds at the end of World War II . 
But , in the midst of the general suffering , one group - the Roma - has been ignored . 
Europe &apos;s largest and most disadvantaged ethnic minority , with a population equal to that of Greece , millions of Roma are trapped in extreme poverty and ignorance , compounded by widespread discrimination . 
Indeed , the 2009 European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey found that Roma experience more severe discrimination than any other ethnic-minority group in Europe . 
Hard times provoke aggressive , vindictive , and intolerant attitudes , and Roma have become scapegoats in this economic crisis . 
In fact , Roma-bashing is helping far-right political parties to mobilize and nationalist leaders to win votes . 
Even some mainstream political parties have resorted to using anti-Roma rhetoric that would have been inconceivable a decade ago . 
Six years ago , the Open Society Foundation , the World Bank , and nine national governments addressed the issue by elaborating a step-by-step plan to integrate the Roma into European society . 
Known as the &quot; Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-15 , &quot; the program prioritized four areas : health , housing , education , and employment . 
This year , the European Commission has requested that all EU member states develop and implement strategies to promote Roma social inclusion in these areas . 
The Decade of Roma Inclusion provides a blueprint for how to achieve integration and equality , and to eliminate unlawful discrimination . 
But these goals can be achieved only if the EU resolves its financial crisis , embarks on a sustainable recovery , and , above all , becomes an inclusive economy.Otherwise , Roma will inevitably serve as the EU &apos;s convenient scapegoats . 
Social exclusion is not only morally and legally repugnant ; it also defies economic sense . 
Roma are Europe &apos;s youngest and fastest-growing population with an average age of 25 , in contrast to the European average of 40 . 
According to recent World Bank research , Roma comprise approximately 23 % of new entrants into Bulgaria &apos;s labor market . 
In Romania , the figure is 21 % . 
The vast majority of working-age Roma , however , lack the requisite education to compete successfully in the labor market . 
By continuing to shunt Roma children into &quot; special &quot; schools , where expectations are low and results still lower , EU member states are squandering hundreds of millions of euros annually in productivity and tax revenues . 
The message is simple : improving opportunities for Roma is morally right and economically smart . 
Integration is possible . 
I grew up in a small , impoverished town in central Serbia , where my parents lifted themselves out of extreme poverty and deprivation . 
My father obtained a high school diploma and became a taxi driver , while my mother attended university and worked in a state office . 
We were proud of the two-room house my parents managed to build before we moved into a larger home in an ethnically mixed area . 
Having grown up in a family that struggled to rise from poverty to the middle class , I went on to study law and completed an NGO-management training program at Harvard University . 
Thousands of Roma have made similar journeys . 
Europe cannot continue to marginalize one of its own minorities ; anti-Roma prejudice and unlawful discrimination must not go unchallenged . 
The status quo is damaging the lives of millions of Roma , but it is also hurting Europe economically and morally . 
The historical truism applies here - Europe &apos;s greatness will be judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members .
