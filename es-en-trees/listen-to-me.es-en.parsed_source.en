Listen to Me ! 
SAN FRANCISCO - Last week , I wrote a 140-character hotel review on Twitter : &quot; Galleria Park Hotel SF rejects noise complaint from ill-trained guest : &quot; Next time , ask for an interior room , not just a quiet room . &quot; &quot; 
I was frustrated because the hotel management was not listening to me when I asked for a quiet room - or later , when I complained . 
Instead of training their employees to listen , they were telling me that I hadn &apos;t made the right request . 
And the hotel managers probably were not listening to me later via Twitter , either . 
Of course , it used to be difficult to listen to customers ; as a company , you could not station people everywhere to pick up random comments , and few customers cared enough to write actual letters - positive or negative . 
Service companies such as airlines could ask employees to collect feedback , but it was overly complicated . 
Nowadays , however , customers are commenting everywhere , and all a company has to do is listen - electronically and humanly . 
Nonetheless , most companies still think of all the new technologies that I write about primarily as message-sending devices - ways to promote their brand , create an image , and sell their product . 
Companies spend a lot of time watching customers , trying to figure them out , but so little time listening to them . 
Indeed , there are lots of depressing statistics about how poorly companies listen . 
They don &apos;t respond effectively to feedback or to questions submitted through their Web sites . 
Many simply don &apos;t reply at all . 
Others send bland emails - &quot; Thank you for writing to us &quot; - without responding to the particular question or comment . 
And then they spend thousands or even millions of dollars trying to figure out what these same customers really want . 
What all companies really need to do to improve their performance is to get better at listening to the conversations that are already out there on the Internet . 
They can listen for many purposes - from figuring out what products or services to offer and understanding which customer wants what , to repairing the damage done when something goes wrong . 
There are two modes of listening . 
There &apos;s the listening you do to learn , which ideally can be somewhat automated . 
You can use sentiment-sensing tools - everything from tools that measure the prevalence of negative or positive words about your offering on Twitter and Facebook , to customer surveys that produce precise , structured data . 
You can find out , for example , that last month 56 % of your users would recommend your product to a friend , versus 79 % the same time last year . 
Oops ! 
Better do some more listening ! 
Then there are the more subtle signals to listen to statistically - whether they are feedback direct to your Web site , emails , press mentions , or Twitter and Facebook feeds . 
What features - positive or negative - are mentioned most often ? 
Which competitors are highlighted ? 
What other companies or products are most often discussed along with yours ? 
Could they be possible marketing partners ? 
All of that is important , but then there &apos;s the listening you do so that your customers can feel listened to . 
That &apos;s something a computer cannot do . 
It requires a person . 
You can reduce the burden to some extent by creating a community of your customers ( and prospects ) so that they can listen to one another . 
Take a site I just visited this morning , for Fitbit , a self-monitoring tool that lets you measure your physical motion , and by implication your exercise , calorie consumption , sleep time , and other factors . 
If that &apos;s unclear to you , just visit the site and ask questions ; other users will answer most of them , and sometimes the staff ( identified with a red badge under their names ; occasionally it &apos;s the CEO ) will chime in with &quot; official &quot; information . 
Fitbit is not unique ; it &apos;s one of many start-ups that are using their own customers to help them achieve greater scale in listening . 
( Yes , the chatter was encouraging enough that I just ordered one ! ) 
But most important is listening well enough to say , &quot; We &apos;re sorry &quot; in a convincing way . Not , &quot; We &apos;re sorry you didn &apos;t appreciate our wonderful service , &quot; but , &quot; We &apos;re sorry we screwed up and gave you a noisy room . &quot; 
In other words , you need to reply with enough detail to show that you listened . 
Refunding a customer &apos;s money - or giving them a free complementary breakfast - is easy . 
But how can you make up for the headache they had all day from lack of sleep ? 
You can &apos;t - but showing that you noticed their unhappiness with you counts for a lot . 
That &apos;s the thinking behind one of my favorite customer-care proposals : that lost luggage should get its own air miles - thus making the customer feel that the airline acknowledges the error and is suffering along with the customer . 
In the end , listening carefully is the best way to show respect for anyone , customer or partner , friend or boss . 
Even though companies do it for business purposes , they have to do it with human sincerity . 
One of my favorite cartoons - from The New Yorker - shows a retail salesman standing next to a display case labeled &quot; Communication technology . &quot; Inside the case ? 
Human ears .
