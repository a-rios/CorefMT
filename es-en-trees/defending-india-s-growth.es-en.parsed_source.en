Defending India \ u0027s Growth 
As India worries about instability among its neighbors , defense spending will likely rise in the year ahead . 
Because approximately 20 % of India &apos;s expenditures already go to defense , there is a risk that the government &apos;s budget deficits may hit unmanageable levels , threatening the hard won growth of the last decade . 
Even before America and its allies began their bombing campaign against Afghanistan &apos;s terrorist infrastructure , India &apos;s expenditures on defense were rising fast . 
In the fiscal year ending in March 2002 the government budgeted 731.4 billion rupees ( US $ 15.2 ) for defense , up 12 % from the previous fiscal year . 
Coming atop an already bloated government deficit , India &apos;s government now faces hard choices if it is to maintain its reputation for economic reform . 
Early in the 1990s , India moved away from the dozy statist system bequeathed by Nehru by adopting market-friendly policies . 
These reforms put the economy on a higher growth trajectory , with average real GDP growth hitting 6 % over the last decade , compared to under 4 % average annual growth in previous decades . 
Inflation remained in single digits throughout the 1990s and , despite mushrooming fiscal deficits , economic growth became more stable . 
The global technology boom helped here , as India created its own &quot; new economy &quot; that had a big impact on the structure of India &apos;s exports . 
High tech exports surged from 16 % annual growth in 1995-96 to 53.5 % in 2000-01 . 
Still , as in so many other countries , high tech was no magic bullet . 
Old-fashioned infrastructure bottlenecks lingered , cramping private sector expansion . 
Even though reform bolstered economic growth by improving productivity in the non-agricultural economy , scant progress was made in raising the living standards of the poor . 
Over 65 % of Indian workers continue to earn their livelihood on the land , yet as the economy adjusted to the 1990 &apos;s reforms , the amount of capital available for government investment in agriculture fell . 
Instead of becoming more modern , agriculture remained as dependent as ever on erratic monsoon rains and became even more volatile in its production . 
Neglect of agriculture should , perhaps , have been expected in the government &apos;s rush to modernize ; what was unexpected was the government &apos;s increasing reliance on dubious fiscal strategies . 
Fiscal deficits have been growing at unsustainable levels . 
Domestic indebtedness , indeed , was 36.8 % of GDP in the fiscal year ending March 2001 compared to 25.7 % in 1997-98 . 
The combined fiscal deficit of the central and state governments now exceeds 10 % of GDP , a key risk in the eyes of international rating agencies . 
Both Standard and Poor &apos;s and Moody &apos;s downgraded India &apos;s sovereign creditworthiness by revising the outlook on long-term foreign-currency debt from stable to negative , and from positive to stable respectively . 
Trimming the deficit is now the government &apos;s biggest challenge , yet it consistently fails even to make the cuts promised in past budgets . 
Moreover , it has proven unable to speed the pace of privatization ( which would add to government revenue ) , partly due to barriers thrown up by India &apos;s bureaucracy . 
These problems , however , are not made in Delhi exclusively . 
Indeed , India &apos;s central government has ( for the most part ) managed to hit its deficit targets in recent years . 
Instead , state finances are an increasing drain on overall government finance , as they have deteriorated extensively . 
This deterioration in government finances is not due to declining revenues , but to sharp increases in expenditures ( such as wages , subsidies , interest payments and defense spending ) , which do little to boost growth in the way that government capital expenditures can . 
This growing fiscal deficit , however , has created a higher monetized deficit , inciting greater inflationary pressures . 
For a while , the government dodged trouble by turning to an improved local bond market , which helped reduce borrowing from the central bank . 
But state incursions into the capital markets are now crowding out the private sector &apos;s ability to borrow . 
Indeed , the government &apos;s market borrowing as a ratio of its total financing needs increased to 66.5 % in the current fiscal year , compared to 20.6 % in fiscal 1991-92 . 
If India is to maintain the faster growth it achieved over the past decade , it must get its fiscal house in order by cutting government expenditures on consumption and speeding up privatization . 
But with the non-agricultural sectors of the economy declining and external trade and the balance of payments weakening because of the global economic slowdown , fiscal prudence will be harder to accomplish . 
Because of this downward spiral in economic activity , banks are now flush with liquidity , which is supporting a rally in the domestic bond market , as the slump in domestic demand drags down demand for bank credit ( see the chart below ) . 
At a time of economic downturn , domestic banks find government bonds a safe place to park their money , making it less difficult for the government to finance its mounting fiscal deficit . 
The government can , of course , live with current conditions , but why not aim for something bolder and better ? 
At the core of India &apos;s reform agenda lay a reorientation of the government &apos;s role in the economy : to improve efficiency by minimising unnecessary state intervention , thus freeing the private sector to raise long-term economic growth . 
Because that agenda remains unfinished , now is not the time for India to merely consolidate its decade of reform . 
Although the lax monetary policy environment of recent years has proven to be relatively efficient in supporting growth , greater fiscal discipline will be needed if increased private investment is to be attracted . 
Faster liberalisation , too , is essential , if India is to achieve the growth rates - say , of between 7 % -8 % , that can begin to improve the lives of its poor . 
Only growth on that scale can provide the government with the money it needs to increase spending on education and health at the same time it increases defense spending , and only investments in human capital can sustain the long-term growth India craves .
