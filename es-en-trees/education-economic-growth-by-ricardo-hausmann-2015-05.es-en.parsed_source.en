The Education Myth 
TIRANA - In an era characterized by political polarization and policy paralysis , we should celebrate broad agreement on economic strategy wherever we find it . 
One such area of agreement is the idea that the key to inclusive growth is , as then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair put in his 2001 reelection campaign , &quot; education , education , education . &quot; 
If we broaden access to schools and improve their quality , economic growth will be both substantial and equitable . 
As the Italians would say : magari fosse vero . 
Enthusiasm for education is perfectly understandable . 
We want the best education possible for our children , because we want them to have a full range of options in life , to be able to appreciate its many marvels and participate in its challenges . 
We also know that better educated people tend to earn more . 
Education &apos;s importance is incontrovertible - teaching is my day job , so I certainly hope it is of some value . 
But whether it constitutes a strategy for economic growth is another matter . 
What most people mean by better education is more schooling ; and , by higher-quality education , they mean the effective acquisition of skills ( as revealed , say , by the test scores in the OECD &apos;s standardized PISA exam ) . 
But does that really drive economic growth ? 
In fact , the push for better education is an experiment that has already been carried out globally . 
And , as my Harvard colleague Lant Pritchett has pointed out , the long-term payoff has been surprisingly disappointing . 
In the 50 years from 1960 to 2010 , the global labor force &apos;s average time in school essentially tripled , from 2.8 years to 8.3 years . 
This means that the average worker in a median country went from less than half a primary education to more than half a high school education . 
How much richer should these countries have expected to become ? 
In 1965 , France had a labor force that averaged less than five years of schooling and a per capita income of $ 14,000 ( at 2005 prices ) . 
In 2010 , countries with a similar level of education had a per capita income of less than $ 1,000 . 
In 1960 , countries with an education level of 8.3 years of schooling were 5.5 times richer than those with 2.8 year of schooling . 
By contrast , countries that had increased their education from 2.8 years of schooling in 1960 to 8.3 years of schooling in 2010 were only 167 % richer . 
Moreover , much of this increase cannot possibly be attributed to education , as workers in 2010 had the advantage of technologies that were 50 years more advanced than those in 1960 . 
Clearly , something other than education is needed to generate prosperity . 
As is often the case , the experience of individual countries is more revealing than the averages . 
China started with less education than Tunisia , Mexico , Kenya , or Iran in 1960 , and had made less progress than them by 2010 . 
And yet , in terms of economic growth , China blew all of them out of the water . 
The same can be said of Thailand and Indonesia vis-Ã -vis the Philippines , Cameroon , Ghana , or Panama . 
Again , the fast growers must be doing something in addition to providing education . 
The experience within countries is also revealing . 
In Mexico , the average income of men aged 25-30 with a full primary education differs by more than a factor of three between poorer municipalities and richer ones . 
The difference cannot possibly be related to educational quality , because those who moved from poor municipalities to richer ones also earned more . 
And there is more bad news for the &quot; education , education , education &quot; crowd : Most of the skills that a labor force possesses were acquired on the job . 
What a society knows how to do is known mainly in its firms , not in its schools . 
At most modern firms , fewer than 15 % of the positions are open for entry-level workers , meaning that employers demand something that the education system cannot - and is not expected - to provide . 
When presented with these facts , education enthusiasts often argue that education is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for growth . 
But in that case , investment in education is unlikely to deliver much if the other conditions are missing . 
After all , though the typical country with ten years of schooling had a per capita income of $ 30,000 in 2010 , per capita income in Albania , Armenia , and Sri Lanka , which have achieved that level of schooling , was less than $ 5,000 . 
Whatever is preventing these countries from becoming richer , it is not lack of education . 
A country &apos;s income is the sum of the output produced by each worker . 
To increase income , we need to increase worker productivity . 
Evidently , &quot; something in the water , &quot; other than education , makes people much more productive in some places than in others . 
A successful growth strategy needs to figure out what this is . 
Make no mistake : education presumably does raise productivity . 
But to say that education is your growth strategy means that you are giving up on everyone who has already gone through the school system - most people over 18 , and almost all over 25 . 
It is a strategy that ignores the potential that is in 100 % of today &apos;s labor force , 98 % of next year &apos;s , and a huge number of people who will be around for the next half-century . 
An education-only strategy is bound to make all of them regret having been born too soon . 
This generation is too old for education to be its growth strategy . 
It needs a growth strategy that will make it more productive - and thus able to create the resources to invest more in the education of the next generation . 
Our generation owes it to theirs to have a growth strategy for ourselves . 
And that strategy will not be about us going back to school .
