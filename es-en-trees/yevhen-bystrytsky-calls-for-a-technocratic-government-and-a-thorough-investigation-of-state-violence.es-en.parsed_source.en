Can Ukraine Be Saved ? 
KYIV - Acrid black smoke hangs in the air and stings the eye in much of central Kyiv , where state repression is dampening hope of resolving Ukraine &apos;s political crisis . 
With a truce between the government and the opposition shattered only hours after it came into effect , and with dozens of people reported killed in recent days , any hope for an end to the country &apos;s deepening civil disorder appears to be fading fast . 
Yes , a tentative settlement has been reached , following mediation by European Union foreign ministers , with a promise of early elections . 
But such settlements have been proposed before , and no agreement is likely to gain broad acceptance unless it includes the immediate departure of President Viktor Yanukovych . 
In fact , Yanukovych &apos;s government seems prepared to use any and all measures to remain in power . 
Taking a page from Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s playbook , tax police are prosecuting civil-society organizations in the hope of cowing them into silence and irrelevance . 
Yet , despite such intimidation , Ukrainians from all walks of life have been protesting for three months in cities across the country . 
At its heart , this is a struggle between Ukraine &apos;s European-oriented West and its Russian-fixated East for the country &apos;s geopolitical soul . 
Will Ukraine move closer to the European Union or instead join the Russian-dominated Eurasian Union ? 
Despite the mounting violence , Ukraine is not on the verge of civil war - at least not yet . 
But make no mistake : the risk of the country - and its military - splintering is very real , as Yanukovych &apos;s decision to sack Volodymyr Zamana , the head of the armed forces , attests . 
The conflict needs to be stopped now . 
To achieve that , Ukraine needs a transitional government of experts and a new constitution that returns the country to the system that prevailed until a decade ago , with power divided between Parliament and the president . 
Moreover , a presidential election should be held within three months , with a new parliament voted in soon after . 
But Yanukovych has shown that he does not want a negotiated solution . 
Until the recent surge in violence , it seemed that dialogue might defuse tensions . 
An amnesty for detained protesters was offered , and protesters agreed to withdraw from government buildings . 
But when demonstrators fulfilled their promise and evacuated occupied buildings , Yanukovych resorted to force in an effort to end the protests altogether . 
Indeed , the police began firing into crowds of demonstrators , and have reportedly killed at least 70 and injured hundreds more . 
Hospitals are overflowing , and many people are avoiding state clinics , because they are afraid of being detained - or worse . 
The activist Yuri Verbitsky , a mathematical physicist , was abducted by five men in late January from a Kyiv hospital , where he had gone to seek treatment after being injured by a stun grenade at a demonstration . 
Verbitsky &apos;s battered body was found the next day in a forest outside the city . 
Any prospect for resolving the crisis ultimately depends on regaining citizens &quot; trust in their police and security forces , which are now viewed by many as an occupying force . 
To reestablish the public &apos;s confidence , there can be no impunity for those who fired bullets or gave the orders to fire . 
Officials &quot; excessive use of force , and the government &apos;s reliance on semi-criminal thugs ( known as titushki ) to attack protesters , must be thoroughly investigated . 
But , even as the ongoing violence makes such an investigation all the more urgent , Ukraine &apos;s prosecutor and courts refuse to act . 
That is why it is crucial that a high-level international mission - comprising civil-society leaders , the Council of Europe , and the European Union - launch a comprehensive inquiry and pressure Ukraine &apos;s government to cooperate . 
The EU and the United States have introduced diplomatic sanctions since the latest round of murderous violence began . 
This should include a travel ban not only on all officials who ordered , oversaw , or implemented the crackdown , but also on Yanukovych &apos;s political enablers : the oligarchs who are now sitting on the sidelines while spiriting large sums of money out of the country . 
Sanctions should be lifted only when a credible investigation into the last three months of violence is permitted and a technocratic government is in place ( at which point the EU and its member states should offer concrete economic assistance ) . 
Prime Minister Mykola Azarov resigned last month , ostensibly to make way for such a solution . 
But Yanukovych has refused to take the next step , or to commit to constitutional reforms , which largely explains the protesters &quot; growing frustration - and their determination to press ahead in the face of brutal repression . 
There is a perception in the West that all of Ukraine &apos;s political forces are weak , divided , and corrupt . 
And there are growing concerns , often fueled by sensationalist media coverage , that far-right forces are gaining the upper hand within the opposition camp . 
But , though such forces do exist , the vast majority of demonstrators on the Maidans across the country are ordinary people angry about abuse of power , state violence , official impunity , and corruption . 
For the venal and vicious elites who have taken control of Ukraine , the real threat is these demonstrators &quot; perseverance , not the provocations of a radical fringe . 
Indeed , while I refuse to believe that Ukraine &apos;s march to civil war is unstoppable , I also know that our citizens will never be silenced again .
