Pakistan &apos;s Polio Tipping Point 
ISLAMABAD - Early this month , tragedy struck Pakistan &apos;s polio eradication campaign once again with the killing of two more polio workers and a policeman on patrol with the vaccination teams . 
The latest murders in Pakistan preceded the killing of nine polio workers in Nigeria , and follow the slaying of another nine Pakistani health workers in December and the New Year &apos;s Day murders of development workers affiliated with public-health efforts . 
The continued targeting of such brave workers is posing a severe challenge to these countries &quot; public-health communities and their collective ambition to reach every child with lifesaving vaccines . 
For Pakistan , the irony is that the country has been a success story for polio eradication , with the number of cases falling from 197 in 2011 to 58 in 2012 . 
Despite recent challenges , Pakistan put vaccinators back on the job in 28 districts , where 12 million children needed to be reached . 
Widespread public support for polio eradication efforts has been reflected in a parliamentary resolution . 
The Ulema Council , a group of influential clerics , has given its backing as well . 
The most recent report by the Independent Monitoring Board of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative , released in November 2012 , acknowledged Pakistan &apos;s recent progress - in stark contrast to the bleak outlook of its previous report . 
But it is critical that the country &apos;s upcoming election does not jeopardize recent gains , particularly during the current low-transmission season , which is the best opportunity to stop the disease in its tracks . 
All political factions must remain committed to the eradication drive if it is to succeed . 
Indeed , despite progress in 2012 , we have not been able fully to interrupt the spread of the poliovirus in Pakistan , owing primarily to obstacles affecting program implementation and management . 
These challenges must be addressed through stronger governance at all levels , particularly given that state authority has been badly eroded in roughly a quarter of the country , where complex factors have created distrust in the name of ethnicity , politics , and religion , resulting in a massive breakdown in law and order . 
Moreover , Pakistan shocked the global public-health community last year by adopting a constitutional amendment that led to the abolition of the national health ministry . 
Unfortunately , the sudden devolution of health responsibilities to the country &apos;s provinces occurred without adequate preparation or oversight . 
The simultaneous scaling back of the local-government system , along with the divisive politics of coalition governments in Pakistan &apos;s fragile democracy , continues to undermine implementation of the polio eradication program . 
The resulting shortcomings in the country &apos;s provincial health systems have manifested themselves not just in the inability to eradicate polio , but also in a recent measles outbreak , which has killed more than 300 children . 
At the same time , local governments &quot; difficulties are having an adverse effect on provision of clean water and proper sanitation , which are vitally important for polio eradication and public health more broadly . 
There have also been cases of refusal by parents to vaccinate their children , typically at the behest of clergy members , owing to the belief that such public-health efforts are in fact a covert sterilization program . 
Indeed , refusal to vaccinate accounts for 2 % of the children who are missed . 
A recent smear campaign aimed at discrediting polio vaccination , in which several MPs publicly took part , has complicated matters further . 
Daunting as all of this may be , stalling vaccination is not an option . 
It is well established that when vaccination is impeded , the number of cases rises drastically , as was shown in Nigeria in 2003 , where a ten-month delay led to the infection of thousands of people domestically , and to reinfection in more than 20 other countries . 
A similar outcome was observed in Pakistan &apos;s Swat Valley after the militant takeover of 2009 rendered the region inaccessible for months . 
This month &apos;s decision to hold back vaccination in Karachi after health workers there were threatened , though understandable , is nonetheless a cause for serious concern in this respect . 
As in Nigeria , vaccination delays will be highly detrimental for neighboring countries . 
Nomadic populations move freely back and forth across the vast and porous Afghanistan-Pakistan border . 
In 2011 , a polio outbreak in China was traced back to Pakistan . 
India , polio-free for the last two years , is well aware that lasting domestic success depends on eradication efforts elsewhere . 
Potential international risks go beyond the immediate neighborhood . 
Already , Pakistan is responsible for the recent appearance of wild poliovirus in Egypt . 
Fortunately , there is no evidence of transmission , but we may not be so lucky in the future . 
Indeed , the risk that Pakistani pilgrims could carry the problem with them on the 2013 Hajj , the largest annual congregation of Muslims , is not just a theoretical threat . 
A worst-case outcome there could set back the fight against polio by decades . 
The scale of the challenge , and hence the multifaceted response that is needed , must not be underestimated . 
Polio today has become an example of the complex problems plaguing Pakistan &apos;s state and its society . 
Pakistan must increase its efforts on polio eradication for reasons that go beyond fulfilling a global health promise ( which is reason enough in its own right ) . 
Success would be a sign of Pakistan &apos;s ability to conquer complex challenges , and it would provide a blueprint for further development interventions . 
In eradicating polio , Pakistan would not just play its part in eliminating the disease worldwide . 
It would also reclaim its own global prestige and potential for progress in other areas .
