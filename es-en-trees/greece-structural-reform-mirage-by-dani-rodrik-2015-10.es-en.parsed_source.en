The Mirage of Structural Reform 
ATHENS - Every economic program imposed on Greece by its creditors since the financial crisis struck in 2009 has been held together by a central conceit : that structural reforms , conceived boldly and implemented without slippage , would bring about rapid economic recovery . 
The European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund anticipated that fiscal austerity would be costly to incomes and employment - though they significantly underestimated just how costly . 
But they argued that long-delayed ( and much-needed ) pro-market reforms would result in a compensatory boost to the Greek economy . 
Any serious assessment of the actual results produced by structural reforms around the world - particularly in Latin America and Eastern Europe since 1990 - would have poured cold water on such expectations . 
Privatization , deregulation , and liberalization typically produce growth in the longer term at best , with short-run effects that are often negative . 
It is not that governments cannot engineer quick growth takeoffs . 
In fact , such growth accelerations are quite common around the world . 
But they are associated with more targeted , selective removal of key obstacles , rather than broad liberalization and economy-wide reform efforts . 
The theory behind structural reforms is simple : opening the economy to competition will increase the efficiency with which resources are allocated . 
Open up regulated professions - pharmacies , notaries , and taxicabs , for example - and inefficient suppliers will be driven out by more productive firms . 
Privatize state enterprises , and the new management will rationalize production ( and shed all the excess workers who owe their jobs to political patronage ) . 
These changes do not directly induce economic growth , but they increase the economy &apos;s potential - or long-run - income . 
Growth itself occurs as the economy begins to converge to this higher level of long-run income . 
Many academic studies have found that the rate of convergence tends to be about 2 % per year . 
That is , each year , an economy tends to close 2 % of the gap between its actual and potential income levels . 
This estimate helps us gauge the magnitude of growth we can expect from structural reform . 
Let &apos;s be hyper-optimistic and suppose that structural reforms enable Greece to double its potential income over three years - pushing Greek per capita GDP significantly beyond the European Union average . 
Applying convergence math , this would produce an annual growth boost of only about 1.3 % , on average , over the next three years . 
To place this number in perspective , remember that Greek GDP has shrunk by 25 % since 2009 . 
So , if structural reforms have not paid off in Greece , it is not because Greek governments have slacked off . 
Greece &apos;s record on implementation is actually pretty good . 
From 2010 to 2015 , Greece climbed nearly 40 places in the World Banks &apos;s business-environment rankings . 
Instead , the current disappointment arises from the very logic of structural reform : most of the benefits come much later , not when a country really needs them . 
There is an alternative strategy that could produce significantly more rapid growth . 
A selective approach that targets the &quot; binding constraints &quot; - those areas where the growth returns are the greatest - would maximize early benefits . 
It would also ensure that the Greek authorities spend valuable political and human capital on the battles that really matter . 
So , which binding constraints in the Greek economy should be targeted ? 
The biggest bang for the reform buck would be obtained from increasing the profitability of tradables - spurring investment and entrepreneurship in export activities , both existing and new . 
Of course , Greece lacks the most direct instrument for achieving this - currency depreciation - owing to its eurozone membership . 
But other countries &quot; experience provides a rich inventory of alternative tools for export promotion - from tax incentives to special zones to targeted infrastructure projects . 
Most urgently , Greece needs to create an institution close to the prime minister that is tasked with fostering a dialogue with potential investors . 
The institution needs the authority to remove the obstacles it identifies , rather than having its proposals languish in various ministries . 
Such obstacles are typically highly specific - a zoning regulation here , a training program there - and are unlikely to be well targeted by broad structural reforms . 
The absence to date of a single-minded focus on tradables has been costly . 
Different reforms have had conflicting effects on export competitiveness . 
For example , in manufacturing , the competitiveness benefits of wage cuts ( &quot; internal devaluation &quot; ) were offset by the increases in energy costs resulting from fiscal austerity measures and price adjustments by state enterprises . 
A more focused reform strategy could have protected exporting activities from such adverse effects . 
Conventional structural reform tends to be biased toward &quot; best practices &quot; - policy remedies that are supposedly universally valid . 
But , as successful countries around the world have discovered , a best-practice mindset does not help much in promoting new exports . 
Lacking its own currency , the Greek government will have to be especially creative and imaginative . 
In particular , the experience of other countries suggests that a quick supply response is likely to require selective , discretionary policies in favor of exporters , rather than the &quot; horizontal &quot; policies that advocates of conventional structural reform prefer . 
Therein lies a paradox : The more orthodox Greece &apos;s macro and fiscal strategy is , the more heterodox its growth strategy will have to be .
