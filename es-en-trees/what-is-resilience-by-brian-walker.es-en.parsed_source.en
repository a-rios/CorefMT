What Is Resilience ? 
CANBERRA - &quot; Resilience , &quot; like love , is difficult to define . 
Yet everyone - from United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to government agencies , company boards , and community groups - is talking about how to build or maintain it . 
So , is resilience a useful concept or just a fleeting buzzword ? 
To answer that question , we need to start with a different one : How much do you think you can change without becoming a different person ? 
How much can an ecosystem , city , or business change before it looks and functions like a different kind of ecosystem , city , or business ? 
All of these are self-organizing systems . 
Your body , for example , maintains a constant temperature of approximately 37 degrees Celsius . 
If your body temperature rises , you start to sweat in order to cool down ; if your temperature falls , your muscles vibrate ( shiver ) to warm up . 
Your body relies on negative feedbacks to keep it functioning in the same way . 
That is basically the definition of resilience : the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance , re-organize , and keep functioning in much the same way as before . 
But there are limits , or thresholds , to a system &apos;s resilience , beyond which it assumes a different way of functioning - a different identity . 
Many coral reefs that were once home to a rich diversity of fish , for example , have become algal or turf ecosystems with very few fish . 
Two main thresholds dictate this change in coral reefs . 
The more nutrients that enter the water ( run-off from nearby land ) , the more the algae are favored , until , at some point , they take over . 
Likewise , if too many herbivorous fish are removed , algae gain a competitive advantage over the corals . 
These two thresholds interact : the more nutrients there are , the less fishing is needed to &quot; flip &quot; the system into the algal state ; and the fewer fish there are , the less nutrients are needed . 
Moreover , thresholds can move as the environment changes . 
In the coral reef example , both the nutrient and fish thresholds fall as sea temperatures rise and the oceans become more acidic . 
So , as climate change proceeds , smaller incremental rises in nutrient levels and drops in fish stocks will flip coral reefs to algal states . 
Thresholds also occur in social systems : think of fads or , more seriously , riot behavior in crowds . 
In business , the debt / income ratio is a well-known threshold , one that can move in step with exchange rates . 
Threshold effects have also been identified in labor supply , transport services , and other determinants of companies &quot; well-being . 
Given the importance of threshold effects , how can a system &apos;s resilience be maintained ? 
For starters , making a system very resilient in one way can cause it to lose resilience in other ways . 
So we have to understand and enhance general resilience - a system &apos;s capacity to cope with a variety of shocks , in all aspects of its functioning . 
From research on a variety of systems , the following attributes have been shown to confer general resilience : 
· A high degree of diversity , especially response diversity ( different ways of doing the same thing , often mistakenly thought of as &quot; redundancy &quot; ) . 
· A relatively modular structure that does not over-connect its components . 
· A strong capacity to respond quickly to change . 
· Significant &quot; openness , &quot; allowing emigration and immigration of all components ( closed systems remain static ) . 
· Maintenance of adequate reserves - for example , seed banks in ecosystems or memory in social systems ( which speaks against just-in-time supply services ) . 
· Encouragement of innovation and creativity . 
· High social capital , particularly trust , leadership , and social networks . 
· Adaptive governance ( flexible , distributive , and learning-based ) . 
These attributes comprise the essentials of a resilient system . 
But resilience itself is neither &quot; good &quot; nor &quot; bad . &quot; 
Undesirable systems , such as dictatorships and saline landscapes , can be very resilient . 
In these cases , the system &apos;s resilience should be reduced . 
Moreover , it is impossible to understand or manage a system &apos;s resilience at only one scale . 
At least three must be included - the focal scale and at least one below and one above - for cross-scale connections most often determine a system &apos;s longer-term resilience . 
Most losses in resilience are unintended consequences of narrowly focused optimization ( like an &quot; efficiency &quot; drive ) that fails to recognize feedback effects on the focal scale that stem from changes produced by such optimization at another scale . 
Resilience should not be confused with resistance to change . 
On the contrary , trying to prevent change and disturbance to a system reduces its resilience . 
A forest that never burns eventually loses species capable of withstanding fire . 
Children who are prevented from playing in dirt grow up with compromised immune systems . 
Building and maintaining resilience requires probing its boundaries . 
If a shift into a &quot; bad &quot; state has already happened , or is inevitable and will be irreversible , the only option is transformation into a different kind of system - a new way of living ( and making a living ) . 
Transformability and resilience are not opposites . 
In order for a system to remain resilient at one scale , parts of it at other scales may have to transform . 
In Australia , for example , the Murray-Darling basin cannot continue as a resilient agricultural region if all parts of it continue doing what they are doing now . 
There simply is not enough water . 
So some parts of it will have to transform . 
Of course , the need for transformation to create or maintain resilience may also affect the highest scale : If some countries and regions are to remain ( or become ) resilient social-ecological systems with high human well-being , it may be necessary to transform the global financial system . 
Transformation requires getting past denial , creating options for change , and supporting novelty and experimentation . 
Financial support from higher levels ( government ) all too often takes the form of help not to change ( bailouts of too-big-to-fail banks , for example ) , rather than help to change . 
Resilience , in short , is largely about learning how to change in order not to be changed . 
Certainty is impossible . 
The point is to build systems that will be safe when they fail , not to try to build fail-safe systems .
