Ronald Reagan Putin 
On May 22 , two free-market liberals will meet in the Kremlin : one an ex-oilman who is the son of a US president , the other an ex-KGB agent who is the son of a Saint Petersburg maintenance man . 
Despite their very different backgrounds , Presidents George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin are forging a remarkably close partnership . 
Indeed , cooperation in the international war on terrorism , the recent agreement to reduce stockpiles of nuclear weapons , and Russia &apos;s rapprochement with NATO appear to be only the beginning of a process that is deepening by the day Russia &apos;s integration with the West . 
But it is in economics , surprisingly , that the two men seem to share the most common ground . 
President Bush may be tempted to believe that Russia &apos;s current economic success is purely the result of high world oil prices . 
Prices aside , the difference between how Russian oil companies were managed in the early 1990s and how they are managed now is too dramatic to ignore . 
So , too , are management improvements in the food industry which have boosted output and quality . 
Throughout the economy , resources are finally flowing into the ever more efficient and well-organized market sector , rather than into the poorly managed Soviet industrial dinosaurs . 
For those who know Russia , this is a staggering turn of events . 
Four years ago , big Russian companies were interested in state subsidies , not structural reforms . 
Now , business leaders believe that the stock-market capitalization of their companies depends on the investment climate . 
The value of their assets matters to them . 
They want to know how much they can borrow from abroad , or at what price shares in their companies may be sold in New York or London . 
Putin does not deserve all the credit for this sea change , but what he has achieved over the last two years is far more than anyone had the right to expect : a simplified tax code , progress toward WTO membership , legal reform , greater transparency . 
Still , if oil prices fall sharply , he will face a huge political problem : bold structural reforms usually require years , not months , to show results . 
Russia &apos;s recent strong growth partly reflects the reforms of the early 1990s , and the reform achievements of 2000 and 2001 will feed through to measurable economic performance only in , say , 2005 . 
But Putin has a true politician &apos;s sense of how to handle adversity . 
Here , he resembles former US President Reagan , whose popularity was rooted in an ability to feel the pulse of the public more accurately than his opponents . 
What distinguishes such leaders , whatever the political context , is that they understand what the public wants . 
Russia &apos;s pundits predict that if growth falls , so too will public support for reform . 
The public wants everything to be fine , in a simple , commonsense way . 
It wants economic growth and it wants it now . 
So Putin recently addressed the time-lag problem in a disarmingly simple way : in his state of the nation address in April , he demanded 8 % growth this year , not the tepid 3-4 % rate his government &apos;s ministers were targeting . 
In doing this , he seemed to be following the credo of Stanislav Strumilin , a mastermind of the Soviet &quot; War Economy &quot; in the late 1920s , who said : &quot; I &apos;d rather stand for high rates of growth than sit &#91; in jail &#93; for low ones . &quot; 
But by proclaiming his adherence to this goal , Putin is not exhorting workers to become Stakhonovites and &quot; exceed production norms . &quot; 
Central planning is not about to stage a comeback . 
Instead , Putin is stoking public support for reform by lighting a fire under the state bureaucracy . 
For Russia &apos;s public knows deep in its bones that Russia &apos;s bloated yet ineffective state is the greatest threat to its economy . 
It knows that the bureaucratic apparatus remains outrageously large , and that civil servants retain numerous expensive perks - cars , dachas , medical services , and more - while most ordinary Russians scrape by on meager wages and vegetable gardens . 
The public also knows that bureaucrats will use any tactic to ensure inertia , and hence their own survival . 
For example , the Soviet system of public-finance management remains virtually intact . 
State spending left over from the previous year is routinely included in the federal budget , regardless of whether the renewed authorization serves a specific and necessary purpose . 
Military reforms have stalled , as if Russia had all the time in the world to rationalize and modernize its defenses . 
In short , bureaucrats do everything they can to force the government to sit on its hands . 
So the Russia that George W. Bush will visit is one of post-revolutionary economic stabilization , accompanied by a reactionary struggle against central authority - a struggle waged not by Russia &apos;s regions , but by the state &apos;s own bureaucrats . 
Some might argue that it is Putin &apos;s revitalization of central power that is reactionary . 
But liberal ideology does not demand an incompetent and weak state . 
That is the type of state Putin is building .
