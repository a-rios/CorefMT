The Battle Cry of the Non-Oppressed 
TEL AVIV - Nobody should be surprised that Scotland &apos;s recent referendum on independence left the United Kingdom intact . 
In the past , regions or communities have achieved statehood almost exclusively after a struggle against colonial subjection and oppression , galvanized by an appeal to a distinctive religious , cultural , or ethnic identity . 
Complaints about economic dynamics , social policies , or governance inefficiencies - the basis of Scotland &apos;s &quot; yes &quot; campaign - are not the cris de coeur of a successful independence movement . 
That is bad news for secessionists elsewhere in the West . 
Of course , Scotland &apos;s technocratic nationalism made sense . 
As the movement &apos;s leader , Alex Salmond , acknowledged in a 2012 consultation document , &quot; Scotland is not oppressed and we have no need to be liberated . &quot; 
The struggle for independence , he explained , was aimed at creating the kind of efficient administrative and economic structures that would enable Scotland to reach its potential . 
The &quot; yes &quot; campaign hoped to win supporters with a utopian vision of an independent Scotland that included European Union and NATO membership ; a currency union with England , but no fiscal union ; improved public services and social benefits ; and lower taxes . 
In other words , Scotland would have everything it has now , only better , and on its own terms . 
This vision was undoubtedly appealing to many Scots . 
In other words , many people &apos;s votes were driven by risk aversion , fear , and intimidation , rather than hope , passion , or deep emotional attachment to a common identity . 
This contrasts sharply with the motivations espoused by Scotland &apos;s nobles in the fourteenth century , when they succeeded in preserving their country &apos;s independence from English rule . 
&quot; It is in truth not for glory , nor riches , nor honors that we are fighting , &quot; they declared , &quot; but for freedom alone , which no honest man gives up but with life itself . &quot; 
In fact , the &quot; no &quot; campaign &apos;s victory might have been even more resounding if the Westminster establishment &apos;s desperate , last-minute offer to grant Scotland more powers on taxation , spending , and welfare had been included as an option in the ballot . 
National movements driven by a historical mission or an uncompromising quest to assert group identity against a dominant power normally do not succumb to economic considerations and last-minute economic bait . 
It was none other than the founder of the Zionist fundamentalist right , Ze &apos;ev Jabotinsky , who warned in 1924 against &quot; the naive assumption that the aspiration of the Palestinians &amp; hellip ; will be paralyzed by such means as subsidies , economic advantages , or bribery . &quot; 
Recognizing that their &quot; natural patriotism is pure and noble , &quot; he knew that they could not be &quot; bought off . &quot; 
Now , Salmond is probably re-thinking his avoidance of nativist identity politics . 
What Edmund Burke defined as a group &apos;s attachment to &quot; the inns and resting places of the human spirit &quot; - that is , ethnic , religious , and community ties - would have been a much more powerful mobilizing force for an independence movement . 
The &quot; yes &quot; campaigners would not have had to look far for inspiration . 
James Joyce - himself not devoid of traces of Irish nationalism - wrote that &quot; nationality , language , &#91; and &#93; religion &quot; are &quot; the nets &quot; into which &quot; a man is born . &quot; 
Similarly , George Orwell distinguished between Celtic nationalism and Anglophobia , stating that the former is belief &quot; in the past and future greatness of the Celtic peoples . &quot; 
True , Scotland &apos;s great minds in the age of Enlightenment , such as David Hume , Adam Smith , and even the national poet , Robert Burns , were all fervent advocates of &quot; Britishness , &quot; whatever that might mean today . 
Yet an identity-based campaign could have resorted to the heritage of the Scottish Renaissance of the mid-twentieth century or to the Celtic Revival and Celtic Twilight movements , which awakened a spirit of cultural nationalism among Scots in the late nineteenth century . 
In the run-up to the referendum , Scotland &apos;s independence movement became an important point of reference for Catalans and Basques in Spain , the Flemish in Belgium , the Veneto and South Tyrol regions in Italy , Corsicans and Bretons in France , and the secessionists of Quebec . 
All hoped that Scotland would pave the way for the peaceful breakup of their own states . 
With the defeat of Scotland &apos;s independence movement - not to mention Québécois voters &quot; stunning rejection of the province &apos;s largest separatist party in last April &apos;s election - that hope may be waning . 
There is little historical precedent for the peaceful breakup of a state , with an exception like Czechoslovakia &apos;s consensual split in 1993 occurring in unique circumstances . 
A state is far more likely to go to war to defend its unity . 
The United States and Spain did it in their civil wars , and today &apos;s Spain would go to the outer limits of its capacity to prevent a Catalan or Basque referendum , let alone independence . 
Nationalist groups in Western democracies are not subjugated people . 
Theirs is the nationalism of free , liberated people , who can expect the most generous devolution deals possible to protect their singular legacies and address their grievances . 
And perhaps that is why federal arrangements like those in Australia and Canada - essentially what Westminster grudgingly offered Scotland - could be their best option .
