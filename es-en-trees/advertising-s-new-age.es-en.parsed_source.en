Advertising &apos;s New Age 
MENLO PARK , CALIFORNIA - Advertising is of interest to everyone , not just marketers . 
After all , it &apos;s advertising that pays for much of the content that many of us see ( including this newspaper ) . 
Of course , there &apos;s good advertising and bad advertising ( and good and bad products ) . 
Fortunately , advertising will ( and must ) change in a way that will accentuate the good and reduce the bad - because advertisers will increasingly need consumers &quot; help in getting the word out , and consumers won &apos;t support bad products . 
( That &apos;s a slightly Utopian overstatement , but there is some truth in it . ) 
Of course , sometimes I have a hard time explaining what I mean when I say that advertising must change . 
It needs to move from sending &quot; messages &quot; to passive consumers to sponsorship , product placement and conversations with active consumers . 
The traditional skills of advertising will give way to those of public relations . 
Advertisers often look at me with a blank expression when I try to explain this . 
So I use metaphors : imagine you sell sports shoes ( are you listening , Nike ? ) . 
You &apos;re not going to intrude on people having dinner in a restaurant , but you might well show up at a ball game , handing out free sneakers to the coolest-looking kids and joining in the festive atmosphere . 
Or think of all the marketers whose brands are popular : people actually pay to wear their branded T-shirts - especially if the marketer is sponsoring a cause they believe in . 
Now I have a practical example . 
Last week , I met Suzanne Xie , a recent graduate in economics from the University of Chicago . 
Her parents , Chinese immigrants , were engineers , and they encouraged her to go into a safe , prestigious career , so she joined a New York investment bank after graduation . 
They recently moved from New York to Palo Alto , California , to see if they could make a go of their start-up idea - a style-oriented photo-sharing site with a twist . 
Thus was born Weardrobe . 
Call it Netflix-meets-fashion-show-meets-Flickr : Young women post photos of themselves and their &quot; looks &quot; and get style inspiration from others . 
It &apos;s real people wearing real clothing . 
The most influential users get a direct line to the brands , and starting next week will be able to borrow the latest fashion releases from the Weardrobe closet . 
Some vendors , such as American Apparel , have already seen the value of their clothes being modeled by real people , and have started showcasing their products by linking to photos of Weardrobe users . 
In a few weeks , Xie and Tong hope to announce a retail partnership . 
The most trusted and active members will get to borrow , wear , and pose in clothing from this brand . 
The sooner they return the items , they sooner they get a new item . Of course , this will add complexity and logistical challenges to the business , but it &apos;s also likely to add revenue to the bottom line . 
And for brands , it &apos;s an opportunity to place product directly in the hands of fashion influencers . 
Product placement has traditionally been seen as a way to get celebrities and models to wear branded clothing , but Weardrobe believes in the power of what Xie calls &quot; micro product placement . &quot; She says , &quot; This sort of micro product placement takes the success of Dove &apos;s Campaign for Real Beauty a step further , allowing clothing companies to reach young women whom others follow . 
Imagine having a bunch of real girls who like a brand so much that they wear and style it for free ! &quot; 
And , of course , aspiring models and stylists will see Weardrobe as a place to be discovered ( just as MySpace and YouTube have become such places for performers ) . 
My point here is not to predict Weardrobe &apos;s success , but to show the kind of creativity and experimentation that makes California such a great place to visit after six months in Russia and a week in New York . 
Each marketer needs to think of a message and a platform appropriate to its niche . 
Financial firms are sponsoring sites such as Wesabe and Mint.com , where users supply their own financial data and get relevant , extremely targeted advice from vendors . 
RealAge does the same for consumers . 
Its advertising base is a little heavy on vitamin supplements , since pharmaceutical companies are extremely constrained in how they can advertise . 
And it needn &apos;t be just online . 
The companies that are sponsoring power outlets in airports are another example of this kind of creativity . 
They are sponsoring something of value and something relevant to their core customer base . Meetup ( I should disclose that I am on its board ) is a company that lets marketers sponsor face-to-face get-togethers of like-minded people : Huggies ( diapers ) sponsors stay-at-home Meetups and offers free diapers ; 
American Express sponsors small-business Meetups and helps covers members &quot; fees . 
Of course , it &apos;s neither easy nor obvious . Advertisers are looking for one big idea . 
But that &apos;s the point . 
Media are fragmenting , and so are advertising and marketing platforms . Advertisers will need to work harder to get the attention of their core audience . What they still don &apos;t understand is that consumers don &apos;t want just to give attention ; they want to get attention . 
In these new communities sponsored by brands , it &apos;s possible for them to get attention from other members while reflecting a little glory onto the brands that sponsor them .
