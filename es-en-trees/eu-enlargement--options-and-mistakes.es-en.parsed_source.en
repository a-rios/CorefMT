EU Enlargement : Options and Mistakes 
CAMBRIDGE : Across Latin America , pressures to engage with the US to increase regional integration are mounting . 
Mexico &apos;s incoming president Vincente Fox has made free labor market integration an important item on his agenda . 
Argentina hopes to achieve a free trade agreement as a way of moving closer to the US , at least in the eyes of investors , and thus shed the risk premiums on capital that have been imposed recently . 
In Asia , in the wake of the financial crisis of 1997 , Japan is aggressively promoting regional economic integration . 
Swap credit lines have been negotiated between regional central banks ; a free trade pact has been offered by other Asian economies to a reluctant Japan . 
Monetary integration is being urged on the South Koreans , who are terrified by this attempted Japanese embrace . 
It is in Europe , however , that the boldest attempt at regional integration is in prospect , as the European Union opens itself to the East . 
After the Southern wave ( Portugal , Spain and Greece ) of two decades ago , this new wave involves , in various stages , 10 postcommunist economies . 
Most prominent in terms of economic size and proximity are Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic . 
But the list goes deep into the Balkans , with Romania and , who knows , even Turkey as potential EU members . 
Europe does not relish this opening eastward ; after all , exports to the east have been wonderful since 1989 . 
Manufacturing production , too , is somewhat successful . 
Integration , however , is another matter , particularly if it includes free labor mobility , participation in Europe &apos;s rich social safety net , and access to European subsidies . 
The East , of course , can &apos;t join fast enough ; the West , never mind the supposed inevitability , wishes it could find a way to black ball them all . 
But expansion is Europe &apos;s destiny , never mind high unemployment ( i.e. people paid not to work ) , never mind European agricultural protection and regional subsidies . 
The East is knocking , and everyone knows that if no answer comes , they will jump the fence . 
In the East there is no doubt about the benefits of joining the West : everybody accepts that access to markets and capital can do only good . 
The remaining doubters should look to Mexico and the stunning success its northern regions experienced by integrating with the US . 
In fact , Mexican workers are returning home , attracted by the boom in Mexico &apos;s North . 
But for Western Europe the discussion seems more dubious . 
Surely , labor opposes the competition , and taxpayers agree , awed by the burden of spreading the welfare state and subsidy system eastward . 
Why not just say , &quot; No thanks &quot; people ask ? 
It is not at all clear what Western Europe stands to gain if expansion spreads the Continent &apos;s inefficiencies and welfare states eastward . 
It would be better all around to save the money that would be wasted and so turn a deaf ear to the east . 
Economic integration of East Germany , on West-German welfare state and union terms , has been hideously expensive and notably ineffective . 
Repeating that experiment on a grand scale across Eastern Europe would be folly . 
The right answer is for Western Europe to use expansion to make a dramatic , clean break : Get rid of all the regional subsidies to Italy , Portugal and Spain that have no beneficial economic function but are mere political payoffs to keep regions and peoples out of the market . 
Also , get rid of all sector subsidies from agriculture to coal and shipbuilding and the EU &apos;s myriad other inefficiencies . 
A heavy dose of labor market deregulation , including unemployment compensation , should also be added . 
Once such liberal reforms are in place , the East should be welcomed on the following terms : full and unrestricted free trade to be phased in rapidly and completely within a decade ; full and unrestricted trade in services like banking , health , and insurance ; full and unrestricted capital mobility . 
There is no need to offer full labor market mobility , nor is there an economic need for early integration within a European Union that is still looking to define itself . 
The East should not wait for the West to act . 
Why would a country that wants access to capital not unilaterally establish a currency board to assure investors of stable finance ? 
Why would a country that seeks capital not buttress property rights and independent economic institutions to become more attractive ? 
And why , seeing the experience of the East German LÃ¤nder , where West German unions are now held responsible for high unemployment , would any country not go slow on building its own welfare state and push hard for market efficiency ? 
The more Eastern Europe &apos;s countries take these steps , the more apparent it will be that integration is a win-win proposition rather than a costly bail-in , the sooner the West will move . 
Only under such an enlargement will the East will turn into an area of high-growth and rapidly rising living standards .
