Long Live China &apos;s Boom 
BEIJING - After three decades of 9.8 % average annual GDP growth , China &apos;s economic expansion has been slowing for 13 consecutive quarters - the first such extended period of deceleration since the &quot; reform and opening up &quot; policy was launched in 1979 . 
Real GDP grew at an annual rate of only 7.5 % in the second quarter of this year ( equal to the target actually set by the Chinese government at the beginning of this year ) . 
Many indicators point to further economic deceleration , and there is a growing bearishness among investors about the outlook for China . 
Will China crash ? 
In fact , many other rapidly growing emerging economies have suffered - and worse than China - from the drop in global demand resulting from ongoing retrenchment in high-income economies since the 2008 financial crisis . 
For example , GDP growth in Brazil has slowed sharply , from 7.5 % in 2010 to 2.7 % in 2011 and to just 0.9 % in 2012 , while India &apos;s growth rate slowed from 10.5 % to 3.2 % over the same period . 
Moreover , many high-income newly industrialized economies ( NIEs ) with few structural problems were not spared the effects of the 2008 crisis . 
South Korea &apos;s GDP growth slowed from 6.3 % in 2010 to 3.7 % in 2011 and to 2 % in 2012 ; 
Given this , China &apos;s economic slowdown since the first quarter of 2010 has apparently been caused mainly by external and cyclical factors . 
Facing an external shock , the Chinese government should and can maintain a 7.5 % growth rate by taking counter-cyclical and proactive fiscal-policy measures , while maintaining a prudent monetary policy . 
After all , China has high private and public savings , foreign reserves exceeding $ 3.3 trillion , and great potential for industrial upgrading and infrastructure improvement . 
Indeed , China can maintain an 8 % annual GDP growth rate for many years to come , because modern economic growth is a process of continuous technological innovation and industrial upgrading . 
Of course , this is true for developed and developing countries alike . 
But developed countries differ from developing countries in an important way . 
Since the Industrial Revolution , developed countries have always been on the global frontier of technologies and industries , which has required them to invest in costly and risky indigenous research and development . 
By contrast , technologies and existing industries in developing countries are in general well within the global frontier . 
In theory , any developing country that can harness its latecomer &apos;s advantage to achieve technological and industrial upgrading can grow faster than developed countries . 
According to the Growth Commission led by Nobel laureate Michael Spence , 13 economies took full advantage of their latecomer status after World War II and achieved annual GDP growth rates of 7 % or higher - at least twice as high as developed countries &quot; growth rates - for 25 years or longer . 
China became one of the 13 economies after 1979 . 
Because the country &apos;s latecomer status explains its 33 years of rapid economic growth , the key to understanding its potential for further rapid growth in the future lies in estimating how large those advantages still are . 
Per capita GDP , which reflects a country &apos;s average labor productivity and its overall technological and industrial achievement , is a useful proxy to estimate latecomer &apos;s advantage . 
That is , the per capita GDP gap between China and developed countries essentially reflects the gap between them in terms of overall technological and industrial achievement . 
According to the most up-to-date estimate by the late economic historian Angus Maddison , China &apos;s per capita GDP in 2008 was $ 6,725 in 1990 dollars , which was 21 % of per capita GDP in the United States . 
That is roughly the same gap that existed between the US and Japan in 1951 , Singapore in 1967 , Taiwan in 1975 , and South Korea in 1977 - four economies that are also among the 13 successful economies studied by the Growth Commission . 
Harnessing their latecomer &apos;s advantage , Japan &apos;s average annual growth rate soared to 9.2 % over the subsequent 20 years , compared to 8.6 % in Singapore , 8.3 % in Taiwan , and 7.6 % in South Korea . 
If the latecomer &apos;s advantage implied by the income gap between the four NIEs and the US enabled the NIEs to realize average annual GDP growth rates of 7.6 % -9.2 % for 20 years , China &apos;s annual growth potential should be a similar 8 % for the 2008-2028 period . 
To realize its potential growth as a latecomer , China needs , above all , to deepen its market-oriented reforms , address various structural problems , and develop its economy according to its comparative advantages .
