Doing Better on Climate Change 
Los Angeles - Tackling global warming , we are often told , is the defining task of our age . 
An army of pundits tells us that we need to cut emissions , and cut them immediately and drastically . 
But this argument is clearly losing the battle for hearts and minds . 
Global warming has now become the lowest-priority policy problem among Americans , according to a new Pew survey . 
Another Pew survey showed that China , the world &apos;s biggest emitter , cares even less than the US about global warming . Just 24 % of Chinese regard global warming as a very serious problem , making China the world &apos;s least concerned country . 
In the UK , an Opinium survey shows that most voters think green taxes are mainly for raising cash rather than the environment , and 7 out of 10 are not willing to pay more in taxes to combat climate change . 
At the same time , the proposed solutions for the problem of global warming have been awful . 
In Rio de Janeiro in 1992 , politicians from wealthy countries promised to cut emissions by 2000 , but did no such thing . 
Leaders met again in Kyoto in 1997 and promised even stricter carbon cuts by 2010 , yet emissions keep increasing , and Kyoto has done virtually nothing to change that . 
What is most tragic is that when leaders meet in Copenhagen this December , they will embrace more of the same solution : promises of even more drastic emission reductions that , once again , are unlikely to be fulfilled . 
Measures that consistently over-promise and under-achieve at vast cost do not win hearts and minds in the best of times . 
And this is manifestly not the best of times . 
Fortunately , we have a much better option , with a much better chance of success : we should make low-carbon energy sources like solar power become a real , competitive alternative to old energy sources , instead of the preserve of rich people who want to feel &quot; greener . &quot; 
We should therefore invest on an effective scale in inventing new technology . 
Contrary to what one would imagine , the Kyoto Protocol has not prompted this research . 
Indeed , research investment has plummeted since the 1980 &quot; s and has actually not increased since , even among Kyoto-participating countries . 
Investing heavily in research and development of low-carbon energy , solar power , or other new technologies would become cheaper than fossil fuels much more quickly . 
Economic estimates show that for every $ 1 spent , we would do $ 16 worth of good . 
Every country should agree to spend 0.05 % of its GDP on low-carbon energy R D. The total global cost would be 15 times higher than current spending on alternative energy research , yet six times lower than the cost of Kyoto . 
An agreement of this nature could be the new Kyoto treaty for the world - the principal difference being that this protocol would actually make a difference and stand a good chance of global acceptance . 
Why not do both : invest in R D , but still promise to cut carbon emissions now ? 
Kyoto-style policies can only ever be an expensive distraction from the real business of weaning us off fossil fuels . 
There are two fundamental reasons why a focus on reducing carbon emissions is the wrong response to global warming . 
First , using fossil fuels remains the only way out of poverty for developing countries . 
Coal provides half of the world &apos;s energy . 
In China and India , it accounts for about 80 % of power generation , and is helping Chinese and Indian laborers enjoy a quality of life that their parents could barely imagine . 
Capping emissions means , effectively , ending this success story for hundreds of millions of people . 
There is no &quot; green &quot; energy source that is affordable enough to replace coal in the near future . 
Instead , our upsized research will make green energy cheaper than fossil fuels by mid-century . 
Second , immediate carbon cuts are expensive - and the cost significantly outweighs the benefits . 
If the Kyoto agreement had been fully implemented throughout this century , it would have cut temperatures only by an insignificant 0.2 ° C ( 0.3 ° F ) , at a cost of $ 180 billion every year . 
In economic terms , Kyoto only does about 30 cents worth of good for each dollar spent . 
And deeper emissions cuts like those proposed by the European Union - 20 % below 1990 levels within 12 years - would reduce global temperatures by only one-sixtieth of one degree Celsius ( one-thirtieth of one degree Fahrenheit ) by 2100 , at a cost of $ 10 trillion . 
For every dollar spent , we would do just four cents worth of good . 
The saddest thing about the global warming debate is that nearly all of the key protagonists - politicians , campaigners , and pundits - already know that the old-style agreement that is on the table for Copenhagen this December will have a negligible effect on temperatures . 
Unless we change direction and make our actions realistic and achievable , it is already clear that the declarations of &quot; success &quot; in Copenhagen this December will be meaningless . 
We will make promises . 
We will not keep them . 
And we will waste another decade . 
Instead , we must challenge the orthodoxy of Kyoto . 
We can do better .
