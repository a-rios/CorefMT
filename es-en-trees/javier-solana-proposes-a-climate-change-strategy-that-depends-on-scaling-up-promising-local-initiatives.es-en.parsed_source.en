Saving the House 
MADRID - A crack in a house &apos;s foundation , if not repaired , can continue to grow , ultimately destabilizing the structure and rendering it uninhabitable . 
Its occupants must then move to another home . 
But the world &apos;s population cannot move somewhere else . 
Houses , while not cheap , are replaceable ; our planet is not . 
Climate change , as we have known for years , is one such crack in the foundation . 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) has been studying the phenomenon since 1988 . 
Twenty-two years ago , the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) was unveiled ; today , 195 countries have agreed to prevent dangerous global warming by limiting the increase in global temperature to 2 ⁰ C. 
Yet we continue along our perilous path . 
The IPCC has calculated that we are hurtling toward temperature rises of 3.7 ⁰ C to 4.8 ⁰ C by the end of the century . 
The crack is widening , and some of the world &apos;s inhabitants - particularly the most vulnerable - are already seeing the water seep in . 
Who is responsible , and who should pay to stop the warming ? 
These questions have dominated international discussion and debate about climate change from the start . 
Distinguishing between causal and remedial responsibility is crucial , and the UNFCCC &apos;s chief document recognizes common but differentiated responsibilities , as well as respective capabilities . 
As the sociologist Claus Offe recently pointed out , it is one thing to say who is to blame for the damage , and quite another to determine who can or should take responsibility for solving the problem . 
This endless search for the true locus of responsibility ( both causal and remedial ) is not restricted to the realm of climate change . 
In a globalized world , for example , citizens of nation-states might wonder ( as many have ) why a financial crisis a hemisphere away causes their countries &quot; banks to collapse abruptly . 
In Europe , where countries have banded together since the end of World War II , yielding some precious individual sovereignty in order to construct a more stable whole , the struggles of the common currency have instilled fear in citizens &quot; hearts - and in their votes . 
In the shift from government to governance , we have built a matrix of actors - private and public , at local , national , and supra-national levels - to address social and economic problems . 
But in this intricate and ever-changing institutional universe , we often no longer know who is in control . 
This issue comes to the fore most frequently in the case of shared global problems , such as climate change . 
Simply put , the international order must be reformed and adapted to the economic rise of countries like India and China . The recent agreement among the BRICS countries ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) to establish a New Development Bank and a contingent reserve arrangement is a clear signal of this thirst for change . 
But a wholesale structural overhaul of the global economy &apos;s institutional architecture is improbable , regardless of the context . 
In the interim , creativity is key . 
The best solutions are those that build on the current structure &apos;s strongest points . 
Top-down governance approaches have been useful , showing the willingness of some of the historical greenhouse-gas emitters to accept remedial responsibility . 
The European Union , for example , has affirmed its commitment to the UNFCCC &apos;s Kyoto Protocol , the only international climate-change treaty to date to include binding emissions-reduction targets . 
But the most recent UNFCCC summits have revealed the limits of this approach . 
So , as the world prepares for the UNFCCC summit in Paris in 2015 , preceded by the high-level summit that UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will convene in New York this September , it will be worthwhile to examine and export creative initiatives emerging from the bottom-up . 
China , for one , has launched seven pilot emissions-trading schemes , covering a quarter-billion people - the second-largest such effort in the world ( after the EU ) . 
In Uganda , the city of Kampala is working to light its streets using solar power . 
Many small island states , such as Tuvalu , are setting an important example by rapidly pursuing the goal of carbon-neutrality . 
One of the UNFCCC &apos;s top priorities is to secure financing to scale up developing countries &quot; mitigation and adaptation efforts , thereby mobilizing the capacity and goodwill of historical emitters to catalyze further innovation . 
Scientists worldwide are working on solutions ; indeed , only science will help us to proceed effectively , just as it has enabled living standards in most of the world to rise above subsistence levels . 
At this critical point , when the fossil fuels that have brought us so much prosperity could lead to our demise , it is again technological innovation that can steer us onto a better path . 
In the case of climate change , only creativity , innovation , responsibility , and political will can enable us to save our common house . 
We need to open our eyes , recognize the crack in the foundation , and face our responsibility to fix it . 
In the first quarter of 2015 , governments should declare their countries &quot; intended contributions to that effort , thereby boosting confidence and accelerating progress en route to Paris . 
Meanwhile , we should be on the lookout for potential innovations and invest in research and development wherever that potential lies .
