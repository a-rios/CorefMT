The High Cost of Feeling Low 
Depression is , according to a World Health Organization study , the world &apos;s fourth worst health problem , measured by how many years of good health it causes to be lost . 
By 2020 , it is likely to rank second , behind heart disease . 
Yet not nearly enough is being done to treat or prevent it . 
The study , led by Saba Moussavi and published last month in The Lancet , also revealed that depression has more impact on the physical health of those who suffer from it than major chronic diseases like angina , diabetes , arthritis , and asthma . 
Yet in the same issue of The Lancet , Gavin Andrews and Nickolai Titov , researchers at the University of New South Wales , reported that Australians with depression are far less likely to receive an acceptable level of care than patients with arthritis or asthma . 
This pattern is consistent with reports from other developed nations . 
Treating depression is often , if not always , effective , and without it , those who suffer from depression cannot live happy , fulfilling lives . 
But , even in narrow cost-benefit terms , it makes sense to spend more on treating depression . 
A study of 28 European countries found that depression cost them € 118 billion in 2004 , or 1 % of their combined GDP . 
The cost of treating depression accounted for only 9 % of this huge sum . 
A much larger share was lost productivity . 
Richard Layard , of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics , has said that mental illness is Britain &apos;s biggest social problem , costing 1.5 % of GDP . 
He estimates that while treatment may cost £ 750 per patient over two years , the result is likely to be an extra month of work , worth £ 1880 . 
Lord Layard advocates more psychotherapy rather than drug treatment . 
In the United States , a research team headed by Philip Wang of the National Institute of Mental Health in Rockville , Maryland , reported similar results last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association . 
Wang &apos;s team conducted a randomized controlled trial that showed that depression screening - to find workers who could benefit from treatment - was cost-effective , reducing health insurance costs to employers , decreasing absence due to sickness , and increasing job retention and productivity . 
Depression is also costly in developing countries . 
In China , according to a recent article by Teh-wei Hu and colleagues in Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology , depression costs 51 billion renminbi , or more than $ 6 billion , per year at 2002 prices . 
A few years ago , a research team led by Vikram Patel reported in the British Medical Journal that depression is common in Zimbabwe , where it was often known by a Shona word that means &quot; thinking too much . &quot; 
Around the world , many primary care physicians underestimate the seriousness of depression . 
Many of them lack adequate training in recognizing mental illness , and may not be up to date with treatments options . 
Patients , too , may fail to seek treatment , because mental illness still carries a stigma that can make it harder to acknowledge than a physical illness . 
The problem has been aggravated , in the US at least , by the refusal of some health insurance policies to cover treatment for mental illness . 
Thus , the US Senate &apos;s recent approval of the &quot; Mental Health Parity Act &quot; is a significant step forward . 
The legislation , which still has to pass through the House of Representatives , would require health insurance plans provided by employers to cover treatment for mental illness at a level similar to coverage for general health care . 
( Unfortunately , the legislation will do nothing for the 47 million Americans who have no health insurance at all . ) 
Depression is an individual tragedy that is multiplied more than 100 million times worldwide . 
So , while we can and should do much better at treating it , perhaps the more significant question is whether we can learn to prevent it . 
Some depression appears to be genetic , in which case genetic therapy may ultimately offer a solution . 
But much mental illness appears to depend on environmental factors . 
Perhaps we need to focus on aspects of living that have a positive effect on mental health . 
Many recent studies show that spending time relaxing with family and friends contributes to how happy people are with their lives , while long working hours , and especially long commuting times , contribute to stress and unhappiness . 
Of course , relaxed and happy people can still become depressed , and stressed and unhappy people may not be depressed , but it is a reasonable hypothesis that happier people are less likely to become depressed . 
LaSalle Leffall , who chaired the President &apos;s Cancer Panel , wrote to President George W. Bush in August , saying , &quot; We can and must empower individuals to make healthy choices through appropriate policy and legislation . &quot; 
If that is true for encouraging healthy diets and discouraging smoking , it is no less true for lifestyle choices that promote greater mental health . 
Governments can &apos;t legislate happiness or ban depression , but public policy can play a role in ensuring that people have time to relax with friends , and pleasant places to do it .
