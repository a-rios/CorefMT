The Tinkerer &apos;s Apprentice 
BERLIN - The best inventions are never finished . 
When the German engineer Karl Benz invented the first petroleum-powered automobile , he did not just create an engine with wheels ; he set in motion an industry that revolutionized the way society was structured . 
Similarly , the English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee did not only build the world &apos;s first Web site . 
He laid the groundwork for the World Wide Web . 
Neither could have anticipated the impact of what he was doing . 
If there is one lesson that economic policymakers should heed in 2015 and beyond , it is this : Just as invention is dynamic , so are the industries it creates . 
As we learned in 2014 , it is a lesson that has yet to sink in entirely . 
When Google was launched , people were amazed that they were able to find out about almost anything by typing just a few words into a computer . 
The engineering behind it was technically complicated , but what you got was pretty rough : a page of text , broken up by ten blue links . 
It was better than anything else , but not great by today &apos;s standards . 
So our co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin - like all other successful inventors - kept iterating . 
They started with images . 
After all , people wanted more than just text . 
This first became apparent after the 2000 Grammy Awards , where Jennifer Lopez wore a green dress that , well , caught the world &apos;s attention . 
At the time , it was the most popular search query we had ever seen . 
But we had no surefire way of getting users exactly what they wanted : J Â­ Lo wearing that dress . 
Google Image Search was born . 
Maps are another great example . 
When people search Google for an address , they do not want a link to Web sites that mention the street . 
They usually want to know how to get there . 
So we built a map that was clickable , draggable , and easy to explore . 
Maps have become such an integral part of Google that most users probably cannot imagine it without them . 
It has been the same with many of our changes . 
Our searches have gotten better over time . 
Google the weather where you live and you will get the forecast for the next few days as the top result , saving you time and effort . 
But Google &apos;s efforts to provide direct answers to questions have fueled complaints at the European Commission . 
Companies like Expedia , Yelp , and TripAdvisor argue that Google searches are depriving their Web sites of valuable traffic , putting their businesses at a disadvantage . 
Instead of us providing you with images , maps , the weather , news , or translated versions of foreign-language sites , they would rather go back to ten blue links . 
A few years ago , a lawyer for one of our competitors drew a picture of a coastline with a little island offshore . 
He added a dotted line , explaining that this was the only ferry connecting the island to the mainland . 
His point was that Google was just like the ferry : the only way to navigate the Internet . 
In reality , there are many ways to get around on the Web . 
For news , you might go directly to your favorite news service . 
If you want to buy something , you might go directly to Zalando or Amazon , where you can research models and prices , get reviews , and pay for your purchase all at once . 
The real point is that the economic landscape in which we are operating is not only competitive ; it is changing constantly . 
This year , our industry reached an important milestone . 
For the first time , people are spending more time on mobile devices than on their desktop computers . 
Time spent on desktops has now fallen to just 40 % . 
And people use mobile devices very differently from the way they use desktops . 
Seven out of every eight minutes spent on a mobile phone is spent within an app , and the most popular app in the world is Facebook . 
Many people look at Facebook , Google , Apple , and Amazon , among others , as companies that no competitor could ever beat . 
I am less certain . 
History is full of examples that show that size and past success guarantee nothing . 
Great companies can be surpassed swiftly . 
Just a few years ago , companies like Yahoo , Nokia , Microsoft , and Blackberry seemed unrivaled . 
They have all since been disrupted by a new wave of tech companies - Google among them . 
Google works very differently from other companies that have been dubbed &quot; gatekeepers &quot; and that are regulated accordingly . 
We are not a ferry , a railroad , a telecommunications network , or an electricity grid with only one line serving you and no competitors allowed . 
No one is stuck using Google . 
People have choices , and they exercise them all the time . 
We know that if we cease to be useful , our users will leave . 
The barriers to entry are negligible , because competition is just one click away . 
Someone in a garage somewhere is gunning for us , and 2015 could be the year that they make their move . 
I know , because not long ago we were in that garage . 
And I know that the next Google will not do what Google does , just as Google did not do what AOL did . 
The upheavals resulting from momentous technological change are rarely expected . 
The telegraph disrupted the postal service . 
Radio and television shook up the newspaper industry . 
Airplanes ended the age of ocean liners . 
Inventions are always dynamic ; that is why the future will always be as exciting as the past .
