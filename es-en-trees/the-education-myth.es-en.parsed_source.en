The Education Myth 
We all know that more education is a Good Thing , especially for our economic futures . 
This is why many countries , particularly in Europe , have numerical targets driving their education policies : 50 % participation in post-secondary education in the UK or Sweden , for example , or 80 % to baccalaureate level in France . 
Chancellor Schroeder &apos;s big idea for solving Germany &apos;s economic problems is , of course , education : including yet more undergraduates in a system struggling to cope with those it has . 
Governments see their main job as delivering economic prosperity , and they view education as a necessary and reliable tool for achieving that end . 
But is it ? 
We are told that in a &quot; knowledge economy , &quot; a country needs ever more graduates and formal qualifications to stay competitive . 
But education simply does not deliver economic growth the way our politicians - and businessmen - believe : more education in does not mean more growth out . 
Worse , the education policies that follow from current beliefs have serious negative consequences for opportunities for young people and the quality of education itself . 
The argument that education matters for the economy is plausible because , at one level , it is obviously right . 
A modern society does need educated people : not just engineers , chemists , and doctors , but millions of people who can write coherent letters , fill in complicated forms , explain insurance policies , and interpret statistical data from machines on factory floors . 
Some of these skills can be learned only in universities ; others can ( and should ) be mastered in primary and secondary schools . 
Employers naturally tend to hire the most educated workers on offer , and so as the number of graduates increase , so does the number of &quot; graduate &quot; jobs . 
However , every study I know of - whether British , Scandinavian , or American - agrees that large numbers of these &quot; graduate &quot; jobs require no more than they did when non-graduates performed them perfectly well . 
In this sense , many societies are already &quot; over-educated . &quot; 
But perhaps this is irrelevant . 
Maybe better-educated workers do their jobs more efficiently , in which case we will surely find a clear relationship between educational attainment and economic growth . 
Alas , no . 
A few recently industrialized countries have pursued successful government-driven education strategies that seem to boost economic development . 
But for every such case - South Korea is the favorite example - there is another , like Hong Kong , where meteoric economic growth had nothing to do with centrally planned education policy . 
Instead , parents pushed their children towards the best schools to give them an individual head start - something parents do the world over - only after they got richer . 
Moreover , for every South Korea , and every Hong Kong , we can also find developing countries where expanding education merely fueled competition for white-collar jobs in a bloated , deadweight state bureaucracy . 
Countries like this explain why large international studies often find a negative relationship between education and growth rates . 
Egypt is a classic example of this . 
Between 1970 and 1998 , its primary school enrollment rates grew to over 90 % , secondary schooling soared from 32 % to 75 % , and university education doubled . 
Egypt started the period as the world &apos;s 47th poorest country ; it ended the period as the 48th poorest . 
But it is not only among developing countries that links between education and growth prove elusive . 
Switzerland has been one of the richest countries in the world for a century - and not because of its natural resources . 
Yet it has the lowest rate of university attendance in Western Europe . 
If you look for a relationship between children &apos;s performance on international surveys of achievement , and their countries &quot; growth rates twenty years on , you will look in vain . 
No such relationship exists . 
So , while any developed country obviously needs an educated population , the idea that having the most education will get you the most prosperity is a chimera . 
Does this matter , though ? 
Surely , education has other virtues , over and above its economic role . 
So maybe we should stop criticizing and start celebrating governments &quot; enthusiasm for spending on education . 
But this would ignore the dark underside of our educational spiral . 
The creation of more &quot; graduate &quot; jobs only proves that as credentials become more common , they become more important . 
Moreover , in the past , someone who left school without the &quot; right &quot; qualifications could still succeed , through an apprenticeship or by working his way up from the shop floor . 
Today , that is becoming impossible : we are creating societies in which the sheep and the goats are marked for life in their teens . 
As university attendance becomes more common , fewer capable young people enter vocational training . 
Yet our economies still need highly trained craftspeople far more than another batch of arts graduates . 
Moreover , rapid expansion of university education all too often comes at the expense of quality . 
Education is expensive because it uses people : there are no vast economies of scale or leaps in productivity . 
Relative pay for teachers has been dropping as their total numbers increase , which affects teacher quality . 
University classes become larger , which means that students are taught less effectively . 
It becomes harder to maintain good university-based research because of the demands of other parts of the education budget . 
Is this really the best route to a vibrant economy and a civilized , cultured , and open society ?
