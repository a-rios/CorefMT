Asian Footsteps in Africa 
CAMBRIDGE - Don &apos;t look now , but capitalism - maligned in these bailout-ridden recessionary days - is reshaping Africa inexorably . 
What is different today is that it is emanating from China and India , rather than from the conventional bastions of capitalist prowess . 
Devi Shetty , a celebrated cardiac surgeon in Bangalore , brings health relief to India &apos;s masses through his Narayana group of hospitals . 
Some years ago , I witnessed his early experiments with rural telemedicine , especially in the Indian states of Karnataka and West Bengal . 
In my visit last month , the wall was adorned by a large map of Karnataka festooned with colored pins , to indicate that he now served most district capitals in the remotest parts of the state . 
Moreover , a world map showed outreach to rural areas of East Africa and Southeast Asia , and the room has been upgraded to reflect a still-expanding global reach . 
All this comes from carefully acquired experience - technical and sociological - with delivering expert medical advice through teleconference facilities , aided by satellite links . 
Shetty &apos;s team has successfully participated in telemedicine consultations - multi-specialty , non-stop availability , and supplemented by continuing education - with hospitals in 14 African countries . 
This effort is part of then Indian President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam &apos;s ambitious pan-African e-Network project to link all 53 African capitals to tertiary care facilities across India . 
Shetty is a healer , first and foremost . 
But he is also an entrepreneur , and this is the latest in his many efforts to create successful , low-cost , but cutting-edge medical ecosystems in tough locations worldwide . 
He aspires audaciously to what he calls the universal Walmartization of healthcare - a reshaping of medical care that the world &apos;s indigent need , and in Africa more than most other locations . 
Cynics say that India &apos;s e-Network is currying favor with Africa in exchange for natural resources . 
But in that effort , India must contend with its neighbor , China , which speaks with a louder voice and carries a larger stick . 
Chinese Communist Party President Hu Jintao &apos;s peripatetic diplomacy across Africa has ensured that the Chinese are omnipresent there . 
China has traded much investment in physical infrastructure in places otherwise shunned - Angola , Sudan , and Zimbabwe - for access to natural resources . 
Witness also an unprecedented convening of 48 African heads of state and senior officials in Beijing in 2006 to signal unequivocally that China would speak with the loudest voice . 
India tried to mimic the event , with an India-Africa summit in New Delhi in 2008 . 
Fourteen countries attended to discuss food price inflation , energy needs , etc . 
But loud voices need not be the most effective . 
Indian influence will no doubt exploit assets less available to others , particularly the Indian diaspora in countries like South Africa , Kenya , Tanzania , and Nigeria . 
India and Africa have been linked over the centuries by trade , religion , and post-imperial political consciousness . 
Gandhi and the Non-Aligned Movement remain important symbols . 
Indians are more part of Africa &apos;s social tapestry than are the Chinese , a fabric that has been strengthened through opportunity and adversity through the ages . 
Consider Olam , a Singapore-headquartered but Africa-centric global agribusiness company . From the soybean farms of Brazil &apos;s Matto Grosso to the granaries of Ukraine , Olam is prized for its ability to add value in disparate conditions . 
Olam was started by Indians in Nigeria and remains a world-beating trader in cotton , coffee , cashews and the like . 
To succeed , Olam has had to work &quot; up-country &quot; ­ - a euphemism for difficult conditions far from comfortable port cities - requiring it to rely on Indians &quot; familiarity with , and willingness to work in , Africa &apos;s interior . 
Indeed , so competent is Olam that when Wilmar , a Southeast Asian firm run by overseas Chinese and a force in its own right in China and across Asia , sought to expand in Africa , it sought out Olam in a joint venture . 
The connection between Nigerian cashew farmers and Devi Shetty &apos;s pediatric cardiac surgery is that they both represent decentralized private activity , undertaken through the market , unlike the operations of the China National Petroleum Corporation , Sinopec , and others in Darfur and elsewhere . � � They all add value , but decentralized market-based activity appears likelier to engender additional goodwill . 
But there is more reshaping to come , again fostered by mutual self-interest , rather than by fiat . 
The Olam and Wilmar joint venture is , in a sense , symptomatic of the combination of assets from across Asia that can catalyze productive change in Africa . 
It is fitting that Olam , in Hebrew , means &quot; transcending boundaries . &quot; 
Such symbiosis requires a healthy disregard for convention . 
Failures will result , surely .
