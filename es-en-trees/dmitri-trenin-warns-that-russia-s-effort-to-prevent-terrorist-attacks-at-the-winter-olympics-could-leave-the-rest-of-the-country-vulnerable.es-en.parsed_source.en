Securing the Sochi Olympics 
MOSCOW - In 2007 , when Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to Guatemala City to support his country &apos;s bid to host this year &apos;s Winter Olympics in Sochi , he knew that winning would be the easiest step in the process . 
Many joked that only Russia would propose a subtropical seaside resort for a winter-sports competition . 
But , while concerns about a lack of snow in the surrounding mountains , or about Russia &apos;s ability to build the needed infrastructure in time , have gradually receded since Russia was awarded the games , one major apprehension has remained : the threat of terrorism . 
Sochi is located in the North Caucasus region , which , following the Soviet Union &apos;s dissolution , experienced a long and brutal armed insurgency in Chechnya , while neighboring Dagestan , in particular , later became a hotbed of Islamist extremism and terrorism . 
In fact , Putin gained widespread support among the Russian people through his decisive and ruthless handling of separatism in the North Caucasus - support that helped persuade then-President Boris Yeltsin to appoint Putin as his successor in 1999 . 
Once in office , Putin - with a military victory and a policy of reconciliation - managed to pacify Chechnya , leaving it more a feudal khanate associated with Russia than a real part of the Russian Federation . 
As a result , for the last dozen years , there has been peace with - and within - Chechnya . 
Terrorism has turned out to be a more stubborn challenge . 
As the war in Chechnya was drawing to a close in 2002 , hundreds of people in a Moscow theater were taken hostage by terrorists from the North Caucasus . 
Similarly , in 2004 , hundreds of schoolchildren in Beslan , North Ossetia , were seized by an armed group . 
The death toll in these two attacks alone topped 500 . 
In 2005 , armed Islamists seized Nalchik , a regional capital in the North Caucasus , and held it for a day . 
In 2010 , at least 40 people died in two explosions in the Moscow metro set off by suicide bombers from Dagestan . 
The following year , 37 people were killed in a similar fashion at Moscow &apos;s Domodedovo airport . 
The attacks have continued , despite Putin &apos;s stated willingness to authorize strikes against suspected terrorists , &quot; wherever they may be . &quot; 
It is fair to say that terrorists have been at war with Russia almost from the very moment the Soviet Union dissolved . 
But it is no longer a fight for independence for a particular region in the Caucasus ; instead , it is a fight to establish a &quot; Caucasus caliphate &quot; based on Sharia law . 
The terrorists &quot; methods have also changed . 
Their tactic of choice is no longer armed insurgency , as in the 1990 &quot; s , or raids by groups of militants , as in the 2000 &quot; s , but individual acts of terror . 
The targets range from police stations and liquor stores in the Caucasus to mainstream Muslim clerics in Tatarstan to ordinary people elsewhere in Russia . 
The Tsarnaev brothers - responsible for last year &apos;s Boston Marathon bombings - exemplify this brand of terrorism , aimed at modern secular society in general , whether in Russia or elsewhere . 
It has been clear from the beginning that the Sochi Olympics , which epitomize everything that the terrorists oppose , would be a likely target . 
The recent bombings in Volgograd , in southern Russia , and Pyatigorsk , in the North Caucasus - which claimed three dozen lives - were probably designed to send the message to Russians that they are defenseless , while communicating to the rest of the world that Sochi is too dangerous to visit . 
And , to some extent , they have succeeded . 
Some have canceled their trips to Sochi , despite the international community &apos;s condemnation of the attacks and vow to defy terrorism . 
US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel recently told reporters that the US , working with Russian security officials , will be prepared to extract Americans from Sochi in the event of an attack . 
But the fact is that Sochi is perhaps the best-protected place in Russia today . 
With Putin &apos;s personal standing at stake , the top priority of Russia &apos;s police and security services is to ensure that the games proceed without incident . 
This raises another risk : with major law-enforcement assets deployed in or near Sochi , terrorists might try to strike elsewhere during the Olympics . 
After all , Russia is a vast country , and the terrorist cells are small and notoriously difficult to penetrate , partly because they often use primitive modes of communication that are difficult to detect . 
And , while international cooperation to combat terrorism is useful , its impact is constrained by suspicion and mistrust , as the Boston Marathon bombings highlighted . 
Parallel to the Sochi Olympics , another contest is already underway between the terrorists who seek to disrupt the games , or at least mar the atmosphere surrounding them , and the forces of the Russian state , whose task is to thwart the terrorists &quot; plans . 
This is one contest that Russia absolutely must win .
