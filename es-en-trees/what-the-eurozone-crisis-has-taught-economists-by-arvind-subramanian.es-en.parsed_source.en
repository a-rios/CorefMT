Three New Lessons of the Euro Crisis 
WASHINGTON , DC - While some observers argue that the key lesson of the eurozone &apos;s baptism by fire is that greater fiscal and banking integration are needed to sustain the currency union , many economists pointed this out even before the euro &apos;s introduction in 1999 . 
The real lessons of the euro crisis lie elsewhere - and they are genuinely new and surprising . 
The received wisdom about currency unions was that their optimality could be assessed on two grounds . 
First , were the regions to be united similar or dissimilar in terms of their economies &quot; vulnerability to external shocks ? 
The more similar the regions , the more optimal the resulting currency area , because policy responses could be applied uniformly across its entire territory . 
If economic structures were dissimilar , then the second criterion became critical : Were arrangements in place to adjust to asymmetric shocks ? 
The two key arrangements that most economists emphasized were fiscal transfers , which could cushion shocks in badly affected regions , and labor mobility , which would allow workers from such regions to move to less affected ones . 
The irony here is that the impetus toward currency union was partly a result of the recognition of asymmetries . 
Thus , in the aftermath of the sterling and lira devaluations of the early 1990 &quot; s , with their resulting adverse trade shocks to France and Germany , the lesson that was drawn was that a single currency was needed to prevent such disparate shocks from recurring . 
But this overlooked a crucial feature of monetary unions : free capital mobility and elimination of currency risk - indispensable attributes of a currency area - could be ( and were ) the source of asymmetric shocks . 
Currency unions , in other words , must worry about endogenous as much as exogenous shocks . 
Free capital mobility allowed surpluses from large savers such as Germany to flow to capital importers such as Spain , while the perceived elimination of currency risk served to aggravate such flows . 
To investors , Spanish housing assets seemed a great investment , because the forces of economic convergence unleashed by the euro would surely push up their prices - and because there was no peseta that could lose value . 
These capital flows created a boom - and a loss of long-term competitiveness - in some regions , which was followed by an all-too-predictable bust . 
To the extent that monetary and fiscal arrangements fail to reduce or eliminate moral hazard , the risk that capital flows create these endogenous asymmetric shocks will remain commensurately high . 
A second insight from the case of the eurozone , advanced by the economist Paul de Grauwe , is that currency unions can be prone to self-reinforcing liquidity crises , because some vulnerable parts ( Greece , Spain , Portugal , and Italy at various points ) lack their own currencies . 
Until the European Central Bank stepped in last August to become the central bank not just of Germany and France , but also of the distressed peripheral countries , the latter were like emerging-market economies that had borrowed in foreign currency and faced abrupt capital outflows . 
These &quot; sudden stops , &quot; as the economists Guillermo Calvo and Carmen Reinhart call them , raised risk premiums and weakened the affected countries &quot; fiscal positions , which in turn increased risk , and so on , creating the vicious downward spiral that characterizes self-reinforcing crises . 
The most appropriate analogy is with a country like South Korea . 
In the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 , South Korea needed dollars , because its firms had borrowed in dollars that domestic savers could not fully supply . 
Thus , it entered into a swap arrangement with the Federal Reserve to guarantee that South Korea &apos;s demand for foreign currency would be met . 
Of course , the euro crisis was not just a liquidity crisis . 
Several countries in the periphery ( Greece , Spain , and Portugal ) were responsible for the circumstances that led to and precipitated the crisis , and there may be fundamental solvency issues that need to be addressed even if the liquidity shortfall is addressed . 
Finally , a less well-recognized insight from the euro-crisis concerns the role and impact of a currency union &apos;s dominant members . 
It is often argued that the United States , as the major reserve-currency issuer , enjoys what then French Finance Minister Val√©ry Giscard d &apos;Estaing famously called in the 1960 &quot; s an &quot; exorbitant privilege , &quot; in the form of lower borrowing costs ( a benefit estimated to be worth as much as 80 basis points ) . 
There was always a downside - previously ignored but now highly salient in our mercantilist era - to this supposed privilege . 
If investors flock to &quot; safe &quot; US financial assets , these capital flows must keep the dollar significantly stronger that it would be otherwise , which is an unambiguous cost , especially at a time of idle resources and unutilized capacity . 
But , in the case of Germany , exorbitant privilege has come without this cost , owing solely to the currency union . 
Weakness in the periphery has led to capital flowing back to Germany as a regional safe haven , lowering German borrowing costs . 
But , yoked to weak economies such as Greece , Spain , and Portugal , the euro has also been much weaker than the Deutschemark would have been . 
In effect , Germany has had the double exorbitant privilege of lower borrowing costs and a weaker currency - a feat that a non-monetary-union currency like the US dollar cannot accomplish . 
The future of the eurozone will be determined , above all , by politics . 
But its development so far has forever changed and improved our understanding of currency unions . 
And that will be true regardless of whether the eurozone achieves the closer fiscal and banking arrangements that remain necessary to sustain it .
