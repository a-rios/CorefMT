Taking Safety Littorally 
PASADENA - In 2011 , the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan &apos;s coastal region . 
Last year , Hurricane Sandy caused a wall of water to engulf low-lying coastal areas on the East Coast of the United States , particularly in New York and New Jersey . 
Such catastrophic events underscore the vulnerability of coastal regions worldwide to extreme weather events that produce intense storm surges ( increased water depth at the coast ) and large , powerful waves . 
Although Sandy , at its peak , was only a post-tropical cyclone when it hit the US , its winds spanned an area of 1,800 kilometers ( 1,100 miles ) , leading to extreme storm surges and waves that decimated the Jersey Shore , flattening communities and destroying the casinos and boardwalks on which the local economy largely depends . 
At Battery Park , on Manhattan &apos;s south end , the surge height reached 4.2 meters , flooding homes and businesses and plunging millions into darkness . 
Waves also reached extreme heights , with a buoy near the entrance to New York Harbor measuring a peak wave ten meters high , from crest to trough . 
Seven years earlier , Hurricane Katrina struck the coast of the Gulf of Mexico in the US as a Category 3 storm . 
With a surge height of 7-10 meters , and flooding at some locations extending 20 kilometers inland , Katrina caused catastrophic damage to the Gulf Coast , which has yet to be fully repaired . 
In 1989 , Hurricane Hugo struck near Charleston , South Carolina , with a surge height of nearly four meters . 
The list goes on . 
When coastal areas were not heavily inhabited , such storms , while violent , did not cause significant , lasting damage to people &apos;s livelihoods and lifestyles . 
But now , with commerce and recreation dominating coastlines worldwide , the &quot; let it be &quot; approach of the past is no longer practical . 
Moreover , as climate change causes sea levels to rise , extreme storms &quot; destructive potential is being significantly enhanced . 
Although this rise may seem small in the short run , especially when compared to the immediate increase caused by major storms , its long-term effects must not be ignored . 
Clearly , the combination of storm surges and large waves causes major devastation in coastal areas . 
In fact , engineering approaches have been developed that can protect coastal residents from the consequences of extreme storms . 
Previous efforts to enhance coastal protection can provide a roadmap to reconstruction that will help to avert future damage . 
One suggested approach is to leave an uninhabited buffer zone extending shoreward from the water . 
In Hilo , Hawaii , after devastating tsunamis struck in 1946 , 1960 , and 1964 , the vulnerable area near the city was declared a municipal park , where no structures were allowed to be built . 
By contrast , Japan relied almost exclusively on an extensive series of seawalls and offshore breakwaters along the east coast of the island of Honshu . 
But , in many areas , the Tohoku tsunami overflowed and even destroyed these protective structures - including the seawall at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in northern Honshu . 
As a result , the plant &apos;s three active reactors suffered near-meltdowns , leading to a buildup of hydrogen gas , a series of explosions and fires , and leakage of radioactive material into the atmosphere . 
To be sure , such coastal defenses could help to protect crucial structures . 
Defensive barriers would not necessarily require heavy investment ; they could be mounds of sand several meters high located along and near the shoreline . In fact , in some areas of the US and other countries , only extensive dune fields and vegetated areas are used to separate buildings from the seashore . 
Sand mounds are particularly advantageous , given coastal areas &quot; economic value . 
In order to protect the local economy further , beaches should be repaired after major storms through &quot; beach nourishment &quot; ( replacement of lost sand from external sources ) . 
Protecting urban areas that are located near the ocean , but lack buffer beaches , requires a different approach . 
One option would be to construct seawalls and / or rock revetments high enough to prevent shoreward inundation . 
But local residents may protest such structures , given that they could make the area less attractive . 
And , as Japan &apos;s recent experience demonstrated , protecting against the most powerful threats - such as the 9.0-magnitude Tohoku earthquake and the subsequent three-meter tsunami - would require massive , costly construction projects . 
For one such area , New York City , an alternative has been proposed : massive storm-surge barriers across the entrance to the harbor region that could be closed when a major storm approaches . 
Such structures have been built across the River Thames in London , and a similar barrier project is underway in Venice , Italy . 
But , in addition to requiring substantial investment , this approach raises serious questions , reflecting uncertainty about the effects that river flows can have on harbors , the environmental consequences of closing a bay , and the impact on shipping . 
In any case , stricter building codes are crucial for structures built in coastal areas . 
In addition , construction in coastal areas damaged by extreme events could be prohibited , as has been done in Hilo , Hawaii . 
Coastal regions are the most vulnerable to many kinds of extreme weather events . 
By considering safety , economics , and aesthetics , the right approach for a particular area can be developed - and local citizens , businesses , and the environment can be defended .
