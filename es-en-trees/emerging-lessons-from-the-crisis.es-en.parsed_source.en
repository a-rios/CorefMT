Emerging Lessons from the Crisis 
ITHACA , NY - The US financial system is careening on the edge of a meltdown . 
All that has kept the much-vaunted font of global capitalism from sliding into cataclysm is the US government , which has effectively become the guarantor and lender of last resort . 
How could things have come to such a pass in a financial system once touted as being the deepest and most sophisticated in the world ? 
Where will it end ? 
It is difficult to answer these questions with much conviction while we are still in the midst of the crisis . 
Indeed , every passing day now seems to bring worse news - even weekends no longer provide respite from the steady stream of gloom ! 
Whatever the final outcome , one thing is certain- the rest of the world will no longer be enthusiastic about adopting the free-market principles that guided US financial development . 
While desperate times may call for desperate measures , massive US government intervention will also make it difficult in the future to make the case that the state should stay out of the workings of the financial system . 
No doubt the satisfying emotion of schadenfraude - pleasure at the pain of others - is coursing through the minds of central bankers and policymakers in emerging markets , who for long bore the brunt of US hectoring about free-market principles . 
They are probably also saying their hosannas for having resisted financial innovations to some degree or another , thanking that for the fact that their economies have not yet been pummeled by the unfolding crisis to as great an extent as the US . 
Unfortunately , these lessons - if taken literally - may end up being the wrong ones for emerging market economies to be drawing . 
Unfortunate because the real lesson to be taken from this crisis is that the abnegation of certain free-market principles may in fact have led to the mess the US now finds itself in . 
Financial development , moreover , is ultimately going to be important for these economies to sustain high growth rates and allow a broader swath of their populations to participate in and benefit from the development process . 
What went wrong in the US ? 
A key problem with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , for instance , was that their regulator failed to do its job of uncovering the massive accounting fraud embedded in their books . 
That and the implicit guarantee of government backing ( which finally turned explicit ) allowed these two institutions to expand enormously , including into exotic financial transactions that they had no business being involved in . 
The roots of the US crisis , of course , go back to the years when Alan Greenspan was chairman of the US Federal Reserve . 
The famous ninja ( no income , no job and no assets ) mortgage loans were as clear a sign of regulatory negligence as any . 
But these obvious signs of malfeasance were all too easily ignored when times were good and in the face of the current US administration &apos;s hostility towards regulation . 
Clearly , financial innovation without effective regulation does not work well . 
In the new world of more sophisticated financial markets , dangers lurk in hidden places . 
Today &apos;s crisis indicates that a set of rigid rules allows resourceful financial institutions to mask riskiness in their portfolios or shift things around to make standard risk metrics appear better than they really are . 
It is impractical to devise a regulatory framework that accounts for every specific financial instrument and institution . 
Rather , it makes more sense to develop a &quot; principles-based &quot; framework that can adapt to financial- market evolution and adopt a broader approach to managing systemic risks . 
Clearly , that was lacking . 
The crisis also confirms that some types of government involvement in financial markets - especially through implicit backing of ostensibly &quot; private &quot; institutions - generate bad outcomes that end up with taxpayers inevitably footing the bill . 
The real lessons from the Fannie and Freddie debacle should be about the dangers of implicit government guarantees coupled with moral hazard and weak regulation , and the risks that lurk even in advanced financial systems . 
These risks are greater in less-developed financial systems , and the costs of cleaning up the messes could also be proportionately larger for poorer economies . 
One thing the crisis does show is that fraud , corruption , and government interference can eat away at the foundations of even the deepest financial systems , especially when these problems are compounded by a regulatory system that is too narrow and rule-bound in its outlook and that , at times , turns a blind eye to obvious rot in the system . 
Now that , at least , is a lesson the emerging markets definitely should take away from the financial crisis .
