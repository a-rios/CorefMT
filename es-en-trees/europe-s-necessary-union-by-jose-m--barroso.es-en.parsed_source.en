Europe &apos;s Necessary Union 
BRUSSELS - The consequences of Europe &apos;s debt crisis are all too present throughout much of the European Union , as distressed economies attempt to stabilize and grow at the same time . 
Notwithstanding the important decisions taken over the last couple of years , the reality is that we need to do more to tackle the challenges facing the eurozone . 
Reform and consolidation measures are being implemented across the EU . 
Yet experts and partners often underestimate our determination . 
All of the steps taken so far have resulted in more European integration , not less . 
It is true that sometimes decision-making in our democratic system takes time . 
But do not misjudge us : the negotiations are about the arrangements , not about the final outcome . 
There is sufficient political will in the EU to do whatever is necessary to protect the euro , because the future of the single currency will determine that of European integration . 
The additional measures that Europe needs must be firmly rooted in a commitment to deeper integration . 
High levels of sovereign debt , together with the behavior of parts of the financial sector , have amplified the crisis in the eurozone and raised important issues of confidence that now require a systemic answer . 
That is why we must complete the unfinished business of economic and monetary union - and why the European Commission has long argued for the creation of a banking union as an indispensable step toward that goal . 
The Commission &apos;s upcoming proposals are part of a broader package leading to economic , fiscal , and political union that will redefine the boundaries of European integration . 
The crisis has starkly revealed the insufficiencies of existing banking supervision . 
We must go beyond cooperation and establish an EU-wide supervisory authority , particularly in the eurozone . 
The link between sovereign debt and bank debt has to be broken once and for all . 
We must end the vicious circle whereby the use of taxpayers &quot; funds - more than â‚¬ 4.5 trillion ( $ 5.7 trillion ) so far - to rescue banks weakens governments &quot; budgets , while increasingly risk-averse banks stop lending to businesses that need funds , undermining the economy further . 
A single rulebook for financial services is being put in place for the single market . 
Building on this , a single European banking-supervision authority would open the way to direct recapitalization of banks through the European Stability Mechanism , as well as to common deposit insurance and a single resolution framework . 
On September 12 , the Commission will present its proposals for a Single Banking Supervisory Mechanism based on three key principles : 
Single supervision : Within the eurozone , coordination between national supervisory bodies is no longer enough . 
Common banking supervision is needed for strengthening confidence among countries using common financial backstops . 
Credibility : The eurozone &apos;s new banking-supervision mechanism will have the ECB at its heart . 
The choice of tasks to be entrusted to the ECB will ensure rigorous , high-quality , and equal prudential supervision of eurozone banks , thereby contributing decisively to maintaining confidence between the banks - and thus increasing financial stability throughout the eurozone . 
Close cooperation with national supervisors will be built into the framework . 
The ECB &apos;s supervisory role will be fully separated from its monetary-policy responsibilities . 
In parallel , the European Banking Authority will continue to perform its existing tasks , namely developing the single rulebook for the entire single market and ensuring convergent supervisory practice throughout the EU . 
Broad coverage : All banks in the eurozone will be covered by the new European supervisory system . 
The road that we have decided to follow will allow for swift action . 
The Single Banking Supervisory Mechanism does not require a treaty change and should be in place by January 2013 . 
Common and more integrated supervision is the first step towards a banking union . 
Next , the Commission will build on our current proposals for deposit-guarantee schemes and bank resolution mechanisms to move toward a single resolution fund and a single resolution authority . 
Once these proposals are implemented , the banking union will be complete . 
Establishing a banking union by 2013 will not give Europe a magic wand with which to wave away the economic crisis overnight ; but it is a major and crucial step to restoring the confidence of Europe &apos;s citizens , international partners , and investors . 
It will ensure financial stability , increase transparency , make the banking sector accountable , and protect taxpayers &quot; money . 
Moreover , it is the start of something much bigger . 
Once again , I would like to stress that the eurozone is drawing lessons from the past and defining a way forward , not backwards , in terms of integration . 
That is good news not only for the euro , but also for the global economy .
