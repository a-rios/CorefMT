The Two Innovation Economies 
HONG KONG - For 250 years , technological innovation has driven economic development . 
But the economics of innovation are very different for those at the frontier versus those who are followers striving to catch up . 
At the frontier , the innovation economy begins with discovery and culminates in speculation . 
From scientific research to identification of commercial applications of new technologies , progress has been achieved through trial and error . 
The strategic technologies that have repeatedly transformed the market economy - from railroads to the Internet - required the construction of networks whose value in use could not be known when they were first deployed . 
Consequently , innovation at the frontier depends on funding sources that are decoupled from concern for economic value ; thus , it cannot be reduced to the optimal allocation of resources . 
The conventional production function of neoclassical economics offers a dangerously misleading lens through which to interpret the processes of frontier innovation . 
Financial speculation has been , and remains , one required source of funding . 
Financial bubbles emerge wherever liquid asset markets exist . 
Indeed , the objects of such speculation astound the imagination : tulip bulbs , gold and silver mines , real estate , the debt of new nations , corporate securities . 
Occasionally , the object of speculation has been one of those fundamental technologies - canals , railroads , electrification , radio , automobiles , microelectronics , computing , the Internet - for which financial speculators have mobilized capital on a scale far beyond what &quot; rational &quot; investors would provide . 
From the wreckage that has inevitably followed , a succession of new economies has emerged . 
Complementing the role of speculation , activist states have played several roles in encouraging innovation . 
They have been most effective when pursuing politically legitimate missions that transcend narrow economic calculation : social development , national security , conquering disease . 
In the United States , the government constructed transformational networks ( the interstate highway system ) , massively subsidized their construction ( the transcontinental railroads ) , or played the foundational role in their design and early development ( the Internet ) . 
Activist states around the world have funded basic science and served as early customers for the novel products that result . 
For a quarter-century starting in 1950 , the US Department of Defense - to cite one crucial example - combined both roles to build the underpinnings of today &apos;s digital economy . 
For countries following an innovative leader , the path is clear . 
Mercantilist policies of protection and subsidy have been effective instruments of an economically active state . 
In the US , the first profitable textile mills blatantly violated British patents . 
And ferociously entrepreneurial private enterprise was supported by a broad array of state investments , guarantees , and protective tariffs , in accordance with the &quot; American System &quot; inspired by Alexander Hamilton and realized by Henry Clay . 
The great , neglected German economist Friedrich List , a student of Hamilton &apos;s work , laid out an innovation roadmap for his own country in 1841 , in his National System of Political Economy . 
It has been used repeatedly : by Japan beginning in the last decades of the nineteenth century ; by the Asian Tigers in the second half of the twentieth century ; and now by China . 
List noted how Britain &apos;s emergence as &quot; the first industrial nation &quot; at the end of the eighteenth century depended on prior state policies to promote British industry . 
&quot; Had the English left everything to itself , &quot; he wrote , &quot; the Belgians would be still manufacturing cloth for the English , &#91; and &#93; England would still have been the sheepyard for the &#91; Hanseatic League &#93; . &quot; 
Coherent programs to promote economic catch-up are relatively straightforward . 
But the transition from follower to leader at the frontier of the innovation economy is more challenging and elusive . 
The US managed the transition roughly between 1880 and 1930 , combining the professionalization of management with a speculative taste for new technologies - electrification , automobiles , and radio - and state tolerance of the Second Industrial Revolution &apos;s great industrial monopolies , which invested their super-profits in scientific research . 
The post-World War II invocation of national security as the legitimizing rationale for an economically active state extended America &apos;s leadership . 
It is not yet clear whether East Asia &apos;s economic powerhouses will succeed in making the transition from follower to frontier . 
To begin , the &quot; national champions &quot; of the catch-up phase must be rendered accessible to competitive assault . 
More generally , the state &apos;s role must shift from executing well-defined programs to supporting trial-and-error experimentation and tolerating entrepreneurial failure . 
And the debilitating &quot; corruption tax &quot; that seems inevitably to accompany economic revolutions must be curbed , as it was in Britain during the nineteenth century and America during the twentieth . 
Here is the moment of strategic uncertainty . 
The &quot; made in America &quot; digital economy exhibits ample momentum in the private sector . 
But leadership of the next new economy - the low-carbon economy - is open . 
America is suffering the consequences of a generation-long effort to render the state illegitimate as an economic actor . 
Europe is mired in its oxymoronic commitment to &quot; expansionary fiscal austerity . &quot; 
Can China manage the economic , cultural , and political transitions necessary to assume the leadership role now up for grabs ? 
I find it intriguing to go back almost 200 years and consider Britain &apos;s political economy when the First Industrial Revolution was gathering steam . 
England in 1820 was governed by a corrupt oligarchy that exercised power in intimate collaboration with a national religious establishment . 
Political legitimacy was validated by fear of anarchy , the terrifying reality of which had been observable across the Channel within living memory . 
Arbitrary , draconian repression was the rule : under the &quot; Bloody Code &quot; of criminal justice , more than 100 felonies were punishable by death or transportation . 
The patent system was notoriously expensive and inaccessible . 
England &apos;s rulers sought in vain to keep a lid on the greatest explosion of economic energy and financial wealth in human history . 
Over a long generation , England was transformed . 
From the Great Reform Act of 1832 to the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 - and on to the civil-service reforms initiated in 1853 and the Representation of the People Act of 1867 - Britain pursued its unique path toward a relatively stable and sustainable democratic capitalism . 
No doubt China &apos;s own path will be as distinctive as the processes by which it has reached its current moment of opportunity . 
Whether or not its path proves to be as progressive as England &apos;s may determine who assumes the mantle of global economic leadership .
