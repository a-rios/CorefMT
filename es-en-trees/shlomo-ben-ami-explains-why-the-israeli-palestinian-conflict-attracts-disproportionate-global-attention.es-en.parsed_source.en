Why Israel ? 
TEL AVIV - Israel &apos;s latest war in Gaza has echoed through Europe &apos;s capitals in a powerful and destructive way . 
In Berlin , London , Paris , Rome , and elsewhere , Israel is being denounced as a &quot; terrorist state . &quot; 
Angry demonstrators burned synagogues in France and , of all places , Germany , with some even chanting &quot; Jews to the gas ! &quot; 
The grotesque coupling of legitimate solidarity with Palestine and anti-Jewish invective seems to have forged a politically correct form of anti-Semitism - one that , 70 years after the Holocaust , is raising the specter of Kristallnacht over Europe &apos;s Jewish communities . 
Israelis are struggling to comprehend why five million refugees and 200,000 deaths in Syria mean so much less to the Western conscience than the 2,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza . 
They cannot quite grasp how European demonstrators can denounce Israel &apos;s wars as &quot; genocide &quot; - a term that has never been applied to the Syrian hecatomb , the obliteration of Grozny by Russia , the 500,000 casualties in Iraq since the United States-led invasion in 2003 , or US airstrikes in Afghanistan and Pakistan . 
In fact , the answer is simple : Defining Israel &apos;s sins in terms borrowed from the Holocaust is Europe &apos;s righteous way to rid itself of its Jewish complex . 
&quot; The Holocaust , &quot; as Thomas Keneally wrote in Schindler &apos;s Ark , &quot; is a Gentile problem , not a Jewish one . &quot; 
Or , as the psychiatrist Zvi Rex famously quipped , &quot; Germans will never forgive the Jews for Auschwitz . &quot; 
There is no denying that Gaza &apos;s agony is a humanitarian disaster . 
But it does not even approach other humanitarian crises of recent decades , including those in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) , Sudan , Iraq , and Afghanistan . 
In fact , since 1882 , the entire Arab-Jewish / Israeli conflict has produced barely half the number of casualties that Syria has in just three years . 
Since 1950 , the Arab-Israeli conflict ranks 49th in terms of fatalities . 
This does not square with the global vilification of Israel that is drowning out legitimate criticism . 
When other countries falter , their policies are questioned ; when Israel &apos;s behavior is controversial or problematic , its right to exist comes under fire . 
There are more United Nations resolutions devoted to human rights abuses committed by Israel than to abuses by all other countries combined . 
Stories about Israel focus almost exclusively on the Palestinian conflict . 
Joyce Karam , the Washington bureau chief of the Pan-Arab newspaper Al-Hayat , believes that this is because &quot; Muslim killing Muslim or Arab killing Arab seems more acceptable than Israel killing Arabs . &quot; 
Syrian , Libyan , and Yemenite victims are faceless ; the lionization of the incomparably fewer Gazan casualties makes them unique . 
This is not to say that Israel should be consoled by the macabre arithmetic of bloodshed . 
The hypocrisy of some of Israel &apos;s critics in no way vindicates its colonial encroachment on Palestinian space , which makes it the last developed , &quot; Western &quot; country occupying and manhandling a non-Western people . 
Most of today &apos;s conflicts - in Colombia , Somalia , the DRC , Sudan , and now even Iraq and Afghanistan - are internal . 
Even a major power like Russia faces punishing sanctions for refusing to end its occupation of a foreign land . 
Israel &apos;s clash with Palestine represents a particularly compelling drama for the West . 
The story of Israel extends far beyond the current conflict , to recount an extraordinary symbiosis between Jewish heritage and European civilization that ended in calamity . 
From its birth , Israel has borne the scars of the greatest crime ever committed on Europe &apos;s soil . 
The plight of the Palestinians - the victims of Zionism &apos;s triumph - touches another neuralgic point in the European mind . 
Nonetheless , the Israel-Palestine tragedy is unique . 
It is an absorbing odyssey of two nations with mutually exclusive claims on sacred lands and religious shrines that are central in the lives of millions of people worldwide . 
It is also a war of conflicting images , in which both parties claim a monopoly on justice and martyrdom . 
Jewish persecution , and the way that Zionism has employed it , has become a model for Palestinian nationalism . 
Catchwords like &quot; exile , &quot; &quot; diaspora , &quot; &quot; Holocaust , &quot; &quot; return , &quot; and &quot; genocide &quot; are now an inextricable component of the Palestinian national ethos . 
It is important to note that the Holocaust does not give Israel immunity from criticism , nor can every attack on Israel &apos;s policies be dismissed as anti-Semitism . 
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s Israel is rightly perceived as a status quo state that aspires to have it all : continued control over and settlement of the Palestinian territories and &quot; quiet for quiet &quot; from the Palestinians . 
But Hamas &apos;s control within Gaza is equally problematic . 
In order to end its fatal flirtation with jihadism and bolster stability , Gaza must pursue an economic and political deal with Israel that represses the temptation of war . 
Just as the rehabilitation of the Egyptian towns along the Suez Canal in the wake of the 1973 Yom Kippur war paved the way for an Israeli-Egyptian peace , a prosperous Gaza would serve the interests of all parties involved - beginning with Israel .
