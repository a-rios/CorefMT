Free-Trade Pitfalls 
MUNICH − The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership , currently the subject of intense negotiations between the European Union and the United States , is making big waves . 
Indeed , given the scale of the two economies , which together account for more than 50 % of world GDP and one-third of global trade flows , the stakes are high . 
In order to ensure that the TTIP benefits consumers on both sides of the Atlantic , those negotiating it must recognize and avoid several key traps - some more obvious than others . 
Bilateral trade agreements have been gaining traction lately . 
For example , the EU and Canada recently concluded a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement , which is likely to become the basis for the TTIP . 
This is not surprising , given the repeated failure of attempts to reach a global agreement via the World Trade Organization . 
The Doha Round of WTO talks was a flop , and the agreement reached in Bali last year , despite being sold as a success , does little more than accelerate the collection of customs duties . 
As it stands , fear of insufficient consumer protection , distorted by vested interests , is dominating the TTIP debate . 
Consider the disagreement over the differing treatment of chicken . 
In the US , chicken meat is washed in chlorinated water ; in Europe , chickens are stuffed with antibiotics while alive . 
In an effort that can be described only as absurd , European producers are attempting to convince their customers that the former method is worse for consumers . 
In reality , consumer protection in the US is considerably better and stricter than in the EU , where , following the European Court of Justice &apos;s Cassis de Dijon decision , the minimum standard applicable to all countries is set by the country with the lowest standard in each case . 
By contrast , the US Food and Drug Administration enforces the highest product standards , meaning that , under the TTIP , European consumers would gain access to higher-quality products at lower prices . 
The main benefit of trade facilitation is that it enables countries to specialize in the areas in which they are most capable . 
As Ralph Ossa showed in a working paper for the US National Bureau of Economic Research , if Germany did not have access to international markets , its standard of living would be half of what it is now . 
The TTIP , according to the Ifo Institute &apos;s Gabriel Felbermayr , could improve German living standards by 3-5 % . 
But these benefits are far from guaranteed . 
One major risk of trade facilitation is trade diversion - that is , a reduction in customs duties between two countries leads consumers to avoid less expensive products from third countries . 
If consumer savings do not outweigh the decline in countries &quot; customs revenue , the end result is reduced welfare . 
Avoiding such an outcome requires provisions enabling a wider set of countries , in particular China and Russia , to participate in the trade-facilitation process on equal terms . 
Indeed , building a sort of &quot; economic NATO &quot; that excludes powers like Russia and China would be inadvisable both economically and politically . 
Instead , these countries should be included in the negotiation process . 
Another potential risk concerns investment protection . 
As it stands , it is acceptable for the EU to assume responsibility when its own health and environmental-protection measures function as de facto trade barriers . 
EU directives capping the CO2 emissions of cars , for example , are actually a kind of industrial policy aimed at protecting small French and Italian automobiles . 
Investment protection would limit this kind of abuse . 
But it is not acceptable for the EU to offer foreign investors protection from a European country &apos;s inability to meet its obligations , in particular to service its debt . 
Such a move , as Handelsblatt &apos;s Norbert Häring recently pointed out , would transform the TTIP into a mechanism for mutualizing liability within the EU . 
EU-wide investment guarantees would artificially reduce the rate of interest under which single EU countries could borrow and thus encourage these countries to take on more debt , effectively suspending the self-correcting mechanism of the capital markets . 
That would lead to the next act in the European debt disaster , with consequences that far outweigh the TTIP &apos;s benefits . 
The TTIP undoubtedly has considerable potential to boost economic performance on both sides of the Atlantic . 
But it will mean nothing if the agreement is allowed to serve as a back door to European debt mutualization through what effectively might come close to Eurobonds .
