The Iranian Message 
MADRID - The Iranian people have spoken , and their voice has been heard . 
More than 70 % of eligible voters turned out to elect the most moderate of the eight presidential candidates approved by the Guardian Council , the body that , among other things , vets candidates for public office . 
Hassan Rowhani &apos;s unexpected first-round victory could open doors , both for diplomacy and for Iran &apos;s sanctions-ravaged economy . 
This opening is important , but the potential for change that comes with Rowhani &apos;s victory is no means limitless or certain . 
After all , Iran &apos;s president does not stand alone at the head of his country . 
Still , the election &apos;s outcome is a strong and hopeful signal , and Iran &apos;s international negotiating partners must pay proper attention and react in kind . 
The mood in Tehran this weekend could not have been more different from the last election in 2009 . 
In Iran , as elsewhere , the street is the country &apos;s best social barometer , and Iran &apos;s 75 million inhabitants - frustrated with sky-high inflation and economic hardship - saw reason to celebrate . 
After hand-picking the eight candidates from among almost 700 who sought to run ( notably discarding reformist former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s protégé Esfandiar Mashaei ) , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei carefully allowed his country to speak . 
The shape of Rowhani &apos;s victory is important : with 18.6 million of the 36.7 million votes cast , Iran &apos;s former chief nuclear negotiator defeated the six conservative candidates decisively . 
But he was far from being a front-runner at the start . 
Many were convinced that Saeed Jalili , Iran &apos;s current chief nuclear negotiator , would win , consolidating Khamenei &apos;s hardline rule across the government . 
But the centrist-reformist axis swung into action with pinpoint timing . 
In the week before the vote , both former President Mohammad Khatami and Rafsanjani publically endorsed Rowhani . 
Three days before the election , the only other candidate in the moderate camp , Mohammad Reza Aref , dropped out of the race at Khatami &apos;s request . 
With the centrist and reformist camps united behind him , Rowhani surged to victory . 
In the presidential debates , which I followed closely , Rowhani - himself a cleric - advocated a rebalancing of international relations and better economic management at home . 
With their vote , Iranians sent a strong message of support for that pragmatic agenda , overwhelmingly rejecting Ahmadinejad &apos;s policy of resistance and giving priority to restoring the economy over the pursuit of national glory . 
In his post-election press conference , Rowhani reiterated his promise to recalibrate Iran &apos;s relations with the world . 
He promised greater openness and to repair the country &apos;s international standing , offering greater nuclear transparency in order to restore international trust . 
Clearly , on the nuclear issue , a return to the situation in 2003 is impossible . 
The offer that was on the table when I last sat across from Rowhani is no longer available . 
But , with his victory , Iran has taken a step forward ; it is now up to its negotiating partners to recognize that this is the best chance for diplomatic progress in at least four years , and to make a similar move . 
Obviously , it would be senseless to forget that the Supreme Leader remains firmly in control of the nuclear issue . 
But , by accepting Rowhani &apos;s victory , Khamenei may have sent a hint , if not a clear signal , that a change of course may be afoot . 
It remains to be seen how this would be translated into practice : the true question is how much leeway Khamenei will grant Rowhani , who , like any leader , will be tugged from many sides in his foreign-policy endeavors . 
Particularly on the nuclear issue , which , for Iranian diplomacy , dominates most others , Rowhani must walk a political tightrope . 
Slowly but surely , lines of communication - between Iran and the United States in particular - must be reestablished . 
But a window has opened for both sides . 
Through careful diplomacy and precisely measured incentives , some rapprochement is feasible . 
As we know , such an opportunity is rare , and it must be seized , given the peril that the nuclear issue poses in Iran &apos;s incendiary neighborhood . 
But there is a further international question that cannot go unasked , concerning the role of Iran &apos;s regional proxies . 
Though Rowhani will not have sole decision-making power on this issue , he will have to face it squarely if his plan is truly to recalibrate Iran &apos;s international relations . 
The question that Rowhani must answer can be put as follows : What is Iran &apos;s vocation ? 
Is it willing to act as a responsible regional actor , taking its place in negotiations on the serious problems in its neighborhood ? 
Or will it continue to pursue its interests through its violent , destabilizing proxies in Lebanon , Iraq , and Syria ? 
I know Rowhani to be a rational and reasonable man , and I am hopeful that meaningful international dialogue can be started . 
Though efforts to chart a new diplomatic path will meet opposition and resistance from hard-liners at home , the international community should trust the Iranian people and listen to the message that they have sent . 
It is time to send a message back , by opening constructive , incentive-based channels of communication that enable the international community to achieve a safe resolution of the nuclear issue - and that enable Iran &apos;s leaders to focus on the economic recovery and growth that their people demand .
