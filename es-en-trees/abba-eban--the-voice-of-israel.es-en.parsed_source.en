Abba Eban : The Voice of Israel 
For almost two generations , Abba Eban was Israel &apos;s voice - its messenger to the high and mighty among the nations as well as to the Jewish people all over the world . 
Since he first appeared at the side of Dr. Chaim Weizmann in the late 1940 &apos;s during the struggle for Jewish statehood and sovereignty , few people could articulate the Zionist and later the Israeli case with comparable eloquence and conviction . 
With his Churchillian prose and almost Shakespearean cadences , his mellifluous phrases and sonorous voice carried for decades a message of hope from a people that could have lost all hope and trust in humanity after the horrors of World War II . 
As Ambassador to the United States and the UN , and later as Foreign Minister , he represented an Israel with which the world &apos;s liberal imagination could identify . 
Larger and more powerful nations were envious of so a powerful spokesman , and his speeches became textbook models for statesmen and diplomats in distant lands . 
His books - which he found time to write despite the hectic demands of diplomacy - were a unique combination of enormous erudition and crystalline clarity . 
His scholarly training and rhetorical gifts supplemented each other in a rare fashion . 
Rarely has a small country been represented by a statesman of such world stature : only Thomas Masaryk and Jan Smuts come to mind to compare with him . 
He was a true patriot , in the old-fashioned sense of the word : proud of his people , but never ethno-centric ; a man of the world , but deeply embedded in Jewish cultural heritage ; focused on the plights and tribulations of the Jewish people , but never losing the universal horizon of mankind . 
In short , he was a modern Jew in the best sense of the word . 
It was said of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol that he spoke seven languages , all of them in Yiddish . 
Of Eban it could be said that he spoke ten languages , and all of them with an Oxford / Cambridge accent . 
Yet what appealed to the outside world was not always an asset in the rough and tumble of Israeli politics . 
Perhaps Eban was too urbane , too much of a scholar and gentleman to be able to make it - in Disraeli &apos;s phrase - to the top of the greasy pole . 
Together with Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan he had to leave government in 1974 in the wake of the Yom Kippur War . 
He could hardly have been held responsible for the hubris which led to the avalanche of 1973 , yet it nonetheless brought him down as well . 
He never found his way back , and when confronted with the New Politics of primaries and populism , he became dispirited when he could not cope with this new style . 
In the international arena , Eban &apos;s pen was his sword , and the spoken word his lance . 
He was less adept in political infighting in Israel . 
He could be a fierce turf fighter , yet it is fair to say that he could have fought harder for his moderate and dovish views in the post-1967 government in which he served . 
It is far from clear if he would have prevailed , given his lack of an independent political base , but his international prestige and standing might have given him a chance if he would have chosen to throw the gauntlet . 
He never did . 
Eban &apos;s silence in the last years was not only a product of his disenchantment with Israeli politics or his failing health . 
At a time when public debate in Israel is torn between pseudo-religious nationalist fanatics and anti-Zionists masquerading as post-modernists , the moral certitudes of Eban , for all their urbanity , may sound shallow . 
But nation-building requires moral stamina , and Eban provided it to his people and the world in abundance . 
Without having spoken to Eban in the last few years , I have no doubt that he would be extremely unhappy about the turn of events after the failure of Camp David and Taba in 2000-01 , and the present course of Israeli policies would fill him with foreboding . 
Yet in all probability he would have been even more deeply disappointed in the inability of the Palestinians to come to terms with the existence of the Jewish state . 
As an Arabist by training , immersed in Arab and Muslim culture , he always hoped that the glorious Arab past could be rejuvenated , that an Arab and Muslim culture of tolerance could triumph over fanaticism and extremism . 
This was the bedrock of his hope for reconciliation between Jew and Arab . 
That this Arab renaissance - to use the phrase of the great Palestinian scholar George Antonius - did not take place may have been Eban &apos;s greatest disappointment . 
Despite the high-born image Eban projected , he was an extremely vulnerable person : what some occasionally discerned as traits of vanity may have had their origins in his humble origins . 
While appearing to own the Queen &apos;s English , Eban was not to the manor born : he came from the extremely modest fringes of Anglo-Jewry . 
He was , in the true sense of the word , a self-made man , whose pluck , ambition , drive and inner belief in his destiny carried him to the pinnacle of his achievements . 
His was the aristocracy of the spirit . 
In this Abba Eban was a true representative of the people he so gloriously represented .
