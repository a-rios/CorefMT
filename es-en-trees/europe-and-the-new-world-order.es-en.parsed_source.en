Europe and the New World Order 
BERLIN - November 15 , 2008 , is a date to remember , because on that day history was made . 
For the first time , the G-20 , the world &apos;s 20 leading economies , came together in Washington , D.C. , to find an answer to the global financial and economic crisis . 
While this first meeting resulted in nothing more than declarations of intent , it still marks a historic turning point . 
Faced with the gravest financial and economic crisis worldwide since the 1930 &quot; s , the Western industrial nations ( including Russia ) that previously dominated the world economy are no longer capable of coming up with an effective response . 
Moreover , hopes for mitigating or , indeed , overcoming the global economic crisis rest exclusively with the emerging economic powers , first and foremost China . 
As a result , the G-8 , which excludes the most important emerging-market countries , has lost its significance for good . 
Globalization has resulted in a lasting change in the distribution of power and opportunities , laying the groundwork for a new world order for the twenty-first century . 
Once the current global crisis is over , nothing will ever be the same again . 
The West - the United States and Europe - are in relative decline , while the emerging Asian and Latin American powers will be among the winners . 
The US has responded to the decline of its global strength in an impressive manner , with the election of its first African-American president , Barack Obama . 
Amidst one of the gravest crises in its history , America has proven to itself and the world its ability to reinvent itself . 
And it is clear even now that this decision will have three long-term consequences . 
First , the election of a black president will put to rest the tragic legacy of slavery and the American Civil War . 
From now on , the issues of skin color , eye shape , or gender will no longer play a deciding role for a candidate for high , or even the highest , office . 
The US political system now reflects the country &apos;s demographic changes , as non-white sections of the population grow the fastest . 
Second , Obama &apos;s election will lead to a reorientation of US foreign policy in the medium term . 
In particular , the transatlantic / European focus of American foreign policy , which was previously a matter of course , will increasingly become a thing of the past . 
Third , the internal realignment of America &apos;s political-cultural perspective will be reinforced by the ongoing global shift of wealth and power from the West to the East . 
The Northeastern Pacific powers - China , Japan , and South Korea - are already America &apos;s most significant creditors by far , and their importance will increase further as a result of the financial crisis . 
For the foreseeable future , the greatest opportunities for growth lie in this region , and for both economic and geopolitical reasons America will increasingly turn toward the Pacific region , thus downgrading its transatlantic orientation . 
All of this is bad news for Europe , because once this global crisis is over , Europeans will simply have become less important . 
And , unfortunately , Europe is not only doing nothing to hold off or reverse its decline - it is accelerating the process through its own behavior . 
With the election of Obama , America has turned toward the future within a globalized , multipolar world ; 
Europe , on the other hand , is rediscovering national action in this time of crisis , and thus banking on the past ! 
The European constitution has failed , the Lisbon reform treaty is in limbo after the Irish rejected it , and stronger European economic governance is blocked by German-French disunity . 
The reaction of EU member states to this ongoing self-inflicted impasse is unambiguous : rather than trying to reenergize the process of further political and economic integration , they are primarily acting on their own to try to fill the vacuum that has emerged . 
Certainly , coordination between the member states exists , and is even successful at times , but without strong European institutions , such singular successes will not last . 
There is a very real danger that Europe will simply miss out on an historic strategic turn towards a multipolar world - and at a high price . 
After the summit in Washington , it should have sunk in among Europeans everywhere - even the Euroskeptics of the British Isles - that this strategic realignment is taking place right now ! 
If Europeans cannot get their heads around the fact that the nineteenth century is over , the global caravan will continue to move forward into the twenty-first century without them .
