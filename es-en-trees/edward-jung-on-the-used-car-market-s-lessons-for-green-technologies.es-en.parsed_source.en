Plugging in Green Tech 
BELLEVUE , WASHINGTON - By most measures , solar energy should be a resounding success . 
Technical breakthroughs and continuous improvements in efficiency have driven the price of solar panels from $ 100 per watt in the 1970 &quot; s to less than $ 1 per watt today . 
Yet solar technology still accounts for less than 1 % of global energy consumption . 
For solar energy , as for many other promising green technologies , technical progress has not translated into widespread adoption . 
The problem lies in the structure of the market . 
To understand why , green-energy advocates could take a lesson from a far less glamorous technology : used cars . 
The slow adoption of solar energy is usually blamed on its expense . 
Outfitting a single house with solar panels costs roughly $ 30,000 . 
And , thanks to those lauded efficiency gains , a new installation will quickly become outmoded . 
But Americans routinely spend $ 30,000 on cars that they trade in every four or five years or so . 
They can afford to do so because of the used-car market . 
The used-car market helps consumers to finance their next car purchase , while making older , still-serviceable models available at a deep discount . 
The ongoing utility and value of used cars creates a vast , stratified marketplace with many options in both features and purchase price . 
For next-generation technologies , then , the barrier to entry is not so much the initial cost but rather the absence of a market for the last generation . 
The market for solar power would almost certainly expand if consumers had the option of purchasing less efficient solar panels ( last year &apos;s model ) that cost , say , half as much . 
Government planners would have no trouble justifying a large expenditure for a long-lasting technology - even one that quickly becomes outmoded - if they knew that they could recoup some part of their outlay in just a few years . 
Likewise , investors would be more likely to finance a major deployment of solar panels if the technology &apos;s value persisted beyond the next tweak in solar-cell design . 
Call it the moral of secondary markets : If you are trying to introduce an expensive new technology , make sure that people can buy it used , too . 
The demand for used solar panels is already apparent in the repeated calls for cheaper solar technology . 
And the idea of recycling a green technology has intrinsic appeal . 
But the secondary market for solar-power technology will not emerge until another issue is addressed : what could be called the &quot; velocity of upgrade . &quot; 
Consider how quick and easy it is to trade in an old car for a newer one . 
You can drive into the dealer &apos;s lot in one vehicle and leave in another , because all cars run on the same road infrastructure . 
Upgrading solar panels , by contrast , is agonizingly slow . 
Like so many green technologies , solar requires its own dedicated infrastructure , and each manufacturer designs systems with unique mechanical layouts , mounts , and electrical interfaces . 
As a result , old solar panels cannot simply be swapped out for new ones . 
To upgrade , solar customers do not just have to buy the car ; they have to re-build the roads . 
Needless to say , this kind of upgrade is expensive - and not just for the consumer . 
Because each panel infrastructure is unique , each solar-tech company has to train , maintain , and equip a dedicated crew of employees to install and un-install its products . 
That is a significant financial burden for any company , let alone a start-up in a new market sector . 
Both the velocity of upgrade and the secondary market for solar power could be improved by lowering the transaction costs associated with adopting new solar technology . 
These costs - one-time outlays that are independent of the core technology &apos;s cost - are the real barrier to widespread adoption of green technologies . 
The lower these transaction costs , the more rapidly early adopters can upgrade to next-generation technologies , and the more readily a secondary market can develop . 
For example , the cost of adopting solar energy could be greatly reduced by standardizing solar-panel sizes and mount configurations . 
Such standardization would make it much easier to trade old panels for new ones , decreasing the transaction costs of each upgrade from 40 % of system cost to nearly zero . 
Both primary and secondary markets for solar panels would expand , stratify , and become more liquid . 
More generally , governments should invest in infrastructure that facilitates the deployment of solar and other green technologies at lower costs . 
Such investment would create platforms for innovation and commerce that yield returns far greater than any single technology or industry can deliver . 
Government investment in roads , traffic signals , and parking infrastructure built the platform that engendered a global auto industry , and that today supports continuous upgrades in gas , diesel , electric , and hybrid vehicles . 
In terms of value for money , such investment was much more effective than subsidizing any one automaker or technology . 
A green-tech platform would enable innovators to plan for the long term . 
As it stands , green entrepreneurs have to choose a single technology in which to invest ; if they do not win enough installations using that technology , they are out of the game . 
They have no opportunity to try another technology , offer discounts on last year &apos;s model , or provide service contracts on old equipment - strategies that , in the auto industry , help to smooth out the dips in revenue caused by fluctuating new-car sales . 
Many solar-energy start-ups have already fallen victim to this &quot; one-and-done &quot; dynamic . 
Continued innovation is vital to the future of green technologies , because all of them , including solar , still have technical problems that need to be solved . 
But many are already good enough to spark consumers &quot; appetite . 
Infrastructure that enables faster and cheaper upgrades would accelerate their adoption and further development . 
Green tech is poised to become the next big player in the global market . 
It just needs a place to plug in .
