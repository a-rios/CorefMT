Unmasking the Man with the Wooden Face 
Ever since he became General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President of the Peoples &quot; Republic of China four years ago , Hu Jintao has remained infuriatingly wooden-faced and opaque . 
Over the past year , however , the shroud of mystery has begun to drop . 
Hu &apos;s unbridled glorification of &quot; Mao Zedong Thought , &quot; coupled with his suppression of dissent in the media , has begun not only to reveal a true authoritarian , but also to belie the wishful thinking of liberals , both inside and outside China , who hoped that Hu would be a reform-minded leader . 
It was the late patriarch Deng Xiaoping who in 1992 made the surprising demand that Hu , former Secretary of the Communist Youth League and protégé of ousted party chief Hu Yaobang , be inducted into the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s ( CCP ) Politburo Standing Committee . 
Deng , in effect , personally designated Hu as successor to President Jiang Zemin . 
As Deng had crushed the protestors in Tiananmen Square in June of 1989 , Hu had proven himself to be &quot; firm and resolute &quot; in quelling anti-Beijing riots in Lhasa , Tibet , two months earlier . 
Both understood the dangers of political reform . 
Hu , a life-long Party functionary , was able to fool most observers during his first year in office . 
He and Premier Wen Jiabao - often called a latter-day Zhou Enlai for his administrative abilities and willingness to play second fiddle - rolled out one impressive slogan after another : &quot; Put people first , &quot; &quot; Run the country according to law , &quot; &quot; Render the media closer to the people , &quot; and &quot; Make government transparent . &quot; 
The leadership seemed to be moving away from the ancien regime of Jiang . 
Hu pledged to replace Deng &apos;s elitist ethos of &quot; letting one part of the population get rich first &quot; - a policy that has produced a staggering wealth gap - with a more egalitarian approach . 
As part of his government &apos;s efforts &quot; to construct a harmonious society , &quot; a tax on agricultural produce was scrapped last year , while the State Council vowed to boost annual investment in rural infrastructure . 
But Hu &apos;s administration invariably slams on the brakes whenever their &quot; put-people-first &quot; initiatives begin to threaten one-party rule . 
Hu &apos;s Politburo has consistently refused to let peasants set up non-official farmers &quot; associations or trade unions . 
At the same time , it has allowed farmers across China to fall victim to an epidemic of illegal land grabs by local governments and developers . 
Not only has Hu &apos;s administration failed to protect the rights of the poor and the oppressed , but police and government-hired thugs now frequently harass lawyers and other activists who lobby on behalf of the country &apos;s dispossessed . 
Chen Guangcheng , a blind lawyer - famous for exposing a forced abortion scandal in Shandong - was given a four-year jail term on the dubious charge of &quot; organizing a mob to disturb traffic . &quot; 
Perhaps the most revealing aspect of Hu &apos;s rule is his failure to reform the government &apos;s outmoded institutions . 
In a landmark speech on administrative restructuring in 1980 , Deng underscored the urgency of bringing about a &quot; separation of party and government . &quot; 
Hu , by contrast , seems to find little fault with the status quo , under which the Party remains in charge of not only government , but also state enterprises . 
It is also becoming increasingly clear that Hu will continue to rely on a variety of politically retrograde propaganda tactics . 
He has revived the use of ideological campaigns , akin to those used during the Cultural Revolution , such as a requirement that Party members study The Collected Works of Jiang Zemin . 
Indeed , Hu has sought to restore some of Mao &apos;s luster . 
In a speech marking the Great Helmsman &apos;s 110th birthday in late 2003 , he declared Mao to be a &quot; great proletariat revolutionary strategist and theorist . &quot; 
While Deng had castigated Mao &apos;s &quot; leftist &quot; errors , Hu &apos;s hagiographic address made no mention of his manifold blunders . 
Moreover , Hu has fomented nationalism , not by taking understandable pride in China &apos;s impressive economic growth , but by demonizing Japan . 
He has become increasingly reliant on the facile notion that state-sponsored patriotism and nationalism can hold China &apos;s disparate groups together . 
Finally , Hu , Wen , and the rest of the top leadership have turned themselves into superb firefighters with an uncanny ability to , in Party parlance , &quot; nip the seeds of opposition before they sprout . &quot; 
Apart from sharpening the &quot; tools of the proletarian dictatorship &quot; by strengthening the Peoples Liberation Army and the People &apos;s Armed Police , they have created a labyrinthine &quot; advance warning &quot; system to monitor threats ranging from peasant riots , urban unrest , and bird flu to the influx of Western ideas through the Internet . 
Hu is due to remain in power until 2012 . 
Given the economy &apos;s solid performance and the docility of China &apos;s population , there seems little doubt that Hu &apos;s twenty-first-century market dictatorship will preserve the Party &apos;s mandate to continue ruling - for now . 
But it is equally obvious that Hu , the sphinx-like apparatchik in whom Chinese and Western liberals alike had once invested hope , is unlikely to deliver the more open and humane China that they thought he had promised . 
China under Hu has perhaps found its development model : a form of Leninist capitalism with no aspirations toward a more democratic form of governance .
