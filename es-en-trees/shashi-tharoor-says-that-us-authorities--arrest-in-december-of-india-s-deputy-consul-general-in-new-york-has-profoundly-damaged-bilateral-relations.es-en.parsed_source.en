The Return of the Ugly American 
NEW DELHI - Nearly a month after American authorities arrested India &apos;s deputy consul general in New York , Devyani Khobragade , outside her children &apos;s school and charged her with paying her Indian domestic worker a salary below the minimum wage , bilateral relations remain tense . 
India &apos;s government has reacted with fury to the mistreatment of an official enjoying diplomatic immunity , and public indignation has been widespread and nearly unanimous . 
So , has an era of steadily improving ties between the two countries come to an end ? 
Judging from Indian leaders &quot; statements , it would certainly seem so . 
India &apos;s mild-mannered Prime Minister Manmohan Singh declared that Khobragade &apos;s treatment was &quot; deplorable . &quot; 
National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon called her arrest &quot; despicable &quot; and &quot; barbaric , &quot; and Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid refused to take a conciliatory phone call from US Secretary of State John Kerry . 
Emotions have run high in India &apos;s Parliament and on television talk shows as well . 
Writing to her diplomatic colleagues after her arrest , Khobragade , who has denied the charges against her , noted that she &quot; broke down many times , &quot; owing to &quot; the indignities of repeated handcuffing , stripping , and cavity searches , swabbing , &quot; and to being held &quot; with common criminals and drug addicts . &quot; 
A former Indian foreign minister , Yashwant Sinha , has publicly called for retaliation against gay American diplomats in India , whose sexual orientation and domestic arrangements are now illegal after a recent Supreme Court ruling . 
The government has not taken him seriously , but his suggestion indicates how inflamed passions have become . 
Some retaliation has occurred . 
The initial American rationale ( that foreign consuls in the US enjoy a lower level of immunity than other diplomats ) led India &apos;s government to re-examine privileges enjoyed by US consular officials that are unavailable to their Indian counterparts in the US . 
These privileges - including full-fledged diplomatic ID cards , access to the restricted customs areas of airports , tax-free shipments of items for personal consumption , and no questions asked about the terms of their employment of local domestic staff - were swiftly withdrawn . 
The cardinal principle of diplomatic relations is reciprocity , and India realized that it had been na√Øve in extending courtesies to the US that it was not receiving in return . 
Likewise , the police have removed bollards and barriers that the US Embassy had unilaterally placed on the street in front of its complex in New Delhi , creating an obstacle to free circulation on a public road that India had tolerated in a spirit of friendship . 
( The government has , however , reiterated its commitment to the US Embassy &apos;s security , even reinforcing the police presence outside . ) 
Tempers remain inflamed , with US Ambassador Nancy Powell , in a New Year &apos;s message to Indians , ruefully acknowledging that ties have been &quot; jolted by very different reactions to issues involving one of your consular officers and her domestic worker . &quot; 
Kerry has also expressed &quot; regret &quot; over the incident . 
Indians remain bewildered that the US State Department would so willfully jeopardize a relationship that American officials had been describing as &quot; strategic &quot; over a practice routinely followed by foreign diplomats for decades . 
Most developing-country diplomats take domestic staff with them on overseas assignments , paying them a good salary by their national standards , plus a cost differential for working aboard . 
In Khobragade &apos;s case , perquisites included a fully furnished room in a pricey Manhattan apartment , a television set , a mobile phone , medical insurance , and tickets home . 
The cash part of the salary may be low by US standards - Khobragade herself , as a mid-ranking Indian diplomat , earns less than what the US considers a fair wage - but , with the other benefits , the compensation is attractive for a domestic helper . 
More to the point , Khobragade did not find her maid in the US labor market and &quot; exploit &quot; her ; she brought her from India to help her in her representational duties , on an official passport , with a US visa given for that purpose . 
In almost no other country are local labor laws applied in such a manner to a foreign diplomat &apos;s personal staff . 
Privately , US diplomats express frustration at their helplessness in the face of theatrical grandstanding by the ambitious federal prosecutor , Preet Bharara , an Indian-American who has launched a series of high-profile cases against Indians in America . 
For once , however , the zealous Bharara seems to have slipped up , because Khobragade was arrested at a time when she enjoyed full diplomatic ( not just consular ) immunity as an adviser to India &apos;s United Nations mission during the General Assembly . 
The State Department &apos;s handling of the matter - which included approval of Khobragade &apos;s arrest - has been , to say the least , inept . 
Worse , just before the arrest , the maid &apos;s family was spirited out of India on US visas for victims of human trafficking . 
The implication that an Indian diplomat in a wage dispute with her maid is guilty of human trafficking understandably riles Indian diplomats as much as the treatment of Khobragade after she was detained . 
The American habit of imposing its worldview self-righteously on others is deeply unwelcome . 
To most Indians , common discourtesy cannot be repackaged as moral virtue . 
Indian-American relations had been strengthening , owing to both sides &quot; shared commitment to democracy , common concerns about China , and increasing trade and investment . 
The Khobragade affair suggests , however , that all of this is not enough : sustaining a strategic partnership requires , above all , mutual respect . 
India had handled American diplomats with a generosity of spirit that it felt the bilateral relationship deserved . 
Now , with the same spirit shown to be lacking from the other side , the friendship has suffered . 
Until the US displays appropriate deference to the sensitivities , pride , and honor of other peoples and cultures , it will continue to be resented around the world .
