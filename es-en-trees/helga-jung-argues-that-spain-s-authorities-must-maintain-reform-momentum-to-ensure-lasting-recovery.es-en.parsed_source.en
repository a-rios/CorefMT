The Spanish Revival 
MUNICH - After fighting for its life for the last two years , Spain &apos;s economy finally seems to have moved out of intensive care . 
The banking sector has been deemed &quot; cured &quot; ; demand for Spanish bonds has soared ; and the country can once again raise capital at reasonable interest rates on the market . 
But much more work must be done to ensure a stable long-term recovery . 
First , the good news . 
Investor confidence is on the mend , exemplified by the recent placement of â‚¬ 10 billion ( $ 13.8 billion ) in ten-year government bonds - which was over-subscribed by four times . 
While risk premiums on ten-year bonds remain far above pre-crisis levels , yields have dropped considerably , from 4 % at the beginning of 2010 to 3.2 % today . 
And a growing number of banks and companies are returning to the capital market . 
Moreover , the Spanish economy returned to growth in the third quarter of last year , and is on track to grow by roughly 1 % this year . 
If , as expected , GDP grows by about 2 % next year , Spain will outperform the eurozone average and create an environment conducive to significant long-term employment gains . 
Perhaps the most notable consequence of Spain &apos;s recent reform efforts is its current-account surplus - the country &apos;s first in more than two decades . 
Much of this progress reflects surging exports , which grew at an annual rate of 5.2 % in 2013 , outperforming Germany . 
Rapid export growth , together with a drop in imports , enabled Spain to halve its trade deficit last year . 
In fact , Spanish factories have boosted their productivity to such a degree that they are now taking orders away from their European competitors . 
It should be noted , however , that productivity gains are partly attributable to a massive wave of employee layoffs - the dark side of economic remediation . 
Likewise , the reduced labor costs and falling inflation caused by recession and austerity helped to boost Spanish firms &quot; competitiveness within the eurozone . 
To be sure , wage and price adjustments , including temporary developments affecting food and energy costs , have turned Spain &apos;s inflation rate negative , at roughly -0.1 % . 
But worries about potential deflation scenarios are unwarranted . 
On the contrary , by increasing Spaniards &quot; real disposable incomes , low inflation is helping to stimulate private consumption , fueling a corresponding improvement in economic sentiment indicators , including consumer trust . 
And yet , despite these positive indicators , Spain &apos;s long-term economic recovery remains far from certain . 
One critical test of its trajectory will be how investment activity develops over the next few quarters . 
Though investment stabilized in the second half of last year , it remains well below pre-crisis levels . 
The challenge is not simply to increase investment , but also to ensure that it is sustainable , unlike before the crisis , when excessive allocation of capital to real-estate development caused construction and related sectors to become overheated . 
This time around , investment must be spread across all sectors , boosting their competitiveness and , in turn , their contribution to GDP growth . 
Fortunately , the outlook appears promising , with increased private-sector confidence , rising capacity utilization , and an encouraging sales outlook for companies . 
Ongoing fiscal consolidation - and thus strong pressure to keep a tight rein on the budget - will , however , restrict public-sector investment . 
The most potent threat to Spain &apos;s economic recovery stems from the labor market . 
Making matters worse , despite considerable gains in the last quarter of 2013 , employment growth is far too weak to make a significant dent in joblessness . 
In 2012 , the government implemented sweeping labor-market reforms to increase companies &quot; internal flexibility ( making it easier to dismiss permanent workers and facilitating wage moderation ) , and introduced a model for reducing workers &quot; hours . 
But such changes take effect slowly , and often not until the recovery phase . 
Given this , the government must do more to boost employment in the short term , especially among young people , whose knowledge , effort , and entrepreneurial spirit is critical to Spain &apos;s long-term economic success . 
Additional measures to improve vocational training or extend part-time work , for example , could prove to be invaluable . 
The final challenge facing Spain is government debt , which currently amounts to nearly 100 % of GDP . 
So far , efforts to curb public debt have centered on painful austerity measures , including substantial cuts in the supply of public goods , especially health care and education . 
At the same time , pension reform - including adjustments in how benefits are indexed to inflation - will ease some of the pressure on the public budget . 
Such measures , together with further liberalization of protected domestic sectors , will strengthen Spain &apos;s economic-growth model considerably . 
The risk now is a relapse into reform fatigue . 
While a slowdown in the pace of reform might bring temporary relief , it would almost certainly reverse Spain &apos;s hard-won achievements . 
Indeed , with the worst now over , complacency is the Spanish economy &apos;s worst enemy .
