Lucky Putin , Unlucky Yeltsin 
Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s assertive foreign policy stance of recent years reflects the confidence that comes with a booming economy . 
In 1999 , the year before Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin as president , Russia &apos;s GDP was a paltry $ 200 billion . 
By last year , it had reached $ 1 trillion . 
Real growth has averaged 7 % for eight years , and real incomes have grown by roughly 10 % per year . 
Russia &apos;s budget surplus has stood at more than 7 % of GDP in the last two years , public debt has dwindled to only 8 % of GDP , from 100 % in 1999 , and the current account surplus has averaged at 10 % of GDP for the last eight years . 
But Russia &apos;s stellar economic performance has little to do with Putin &apos;s policy , and a lot to do with the reforms Yeltsin embraced . 
By 1998 , Russia already had achieved a critical mass of markets and private enterprise , while the financial crash of that year worked like a catharsis , forcing the government to abolish enterprise subsidies that underpinned a devastating budget deficit of some 9 % of GDP . 
Moreover , world oil prices that had fallen to $ 10 a barrel started rising toward the stratosphere . 
The whole success story thus was in place in early 1999 , one year before Putin entered the stage . 
To be sure , Putin should be praised for substantial economic reforms during his first three years . 
A new tax code was adopted , with lower and fewer taxes , notably a flat income tax of 13 % . 
The civil code was completed , a new customs code was enacted , and substantial judicial reform was implemented . 
At the same time , however , Putin has systematically eliminated the rudimentary democracy Yeltsin had build . 
One television channel after another was taken over by the state under various pretexts , as were major newspapers . 
Opposition candidates and parties were denied registration for the slightest formal complaint . 
Falsification of elections became the rule . 
Many prominent Russians favored the Pinochet model of authoritarian politics and liberal economics . 
But growing authoritarianism also hit business . 
In October 2003 , Putin cracked down on Mikhail Khodorkovsky , the CEO and main owner of Yukos oil , Russia &apos;s most valuable company , who was thrown into prison on dubious charges of tax fraud after backing Putin &apos;s political opponents . 
Moreover , Putin &apos;s associates wanted Yukos &quot; wealth , which was confiscated by the state oil company Rosneft through lawless taxation , leaving Putin &apos;s tax reform and judicial reform in tatters and severely undermining property rights . 
In fact , since 2003 , Putin &apos;s main economic policy has been re-nationalization . 
Well-run private companies have been more or less forced to sell out to state-dominated companies . 
Gazprom is buying up oil ( Sibneft ) , gas , and power companies at knockdown prices , reinforcing its monopoly . 
That , in turn , allows Gazprom to boost its profitability through price increases , despite stagnant production . 
Indeed , with state companies now producing one-third of Russia &apos;s oil , output growth has plummeted , as owners of private enterprises - the source of dynamism in the sector - are now afraid to invest in new capacity . 
Among foreign investors , both Shell and TNK-BP are being pushed out by Gazprom in their main gas fields in Russia . 
Beyond oil and gas , Russia &apos;s arms export agency , Rosoboronexport , has just seized Avtovaz , the giant dysfunctional Soviet car factory , and VSMPO-Avisma , Russia &apos;s big titanium company , while all aircraft production has been concentrated in one state company . 
The government cheers this re-nationalization , although it has reduced Russia &apos;s industrial growth from 8.3 % in 2004 to 4 % in the last two years . 
Similarly , inefficient state banks - far inferior to private banks even in Kazakhstan or Ukraine - dominate the banking system . 
The not very profitable state-owned Vneshtorgbank , for example , is on a buying spree , aggravating the quality of Russian banking . 
Increasingly , Russia &apos;s oil surpluses drive economic growth through rising investment , which boosts construction and consumption , in turn benefiting retail trade and finance . 
With personal incomes rising strongly , poverty is declining , while 68 % of Russia &apos;s college-age youth now attend universities . 
But other social indicators are unimpressive . 
Life expectancy for men is stuck at 59 . 
The murder rate is even higher under Putin than it was under Yeltsin , as is the traffic death rate . 
None of the big public systems - education , health care , or the military - has been reformed , and the regime shows little interest in doing so . 
Instead , the Kremlin is preoccupied with the profitability and value of the state-dominated companies that it controls . 
Not surprisingly , all corruption indicators have been rising since Putin took over from Yeltsin , whereas they are falling in most post-communist countries . 
Although corruption is pervasive , no top official has been prosecuted . 
Putin and his KGB friends from St. Petersburg sit safely on all this wealth , thanks to their authoritarian governance and control over all security organs . 
Such a powerful apparatus cannot retire to a quiet life in a dacha as Yeltsin did - it would have to privatize everything first - which implies that Putin has no choice but to remain in office , regardless of what he says about not seeking a third presidential term . 
But if he holds on to power contrary to the constitution , his popularity could easily collapse , especially as his economic policy has thrived on luck , not reform .
