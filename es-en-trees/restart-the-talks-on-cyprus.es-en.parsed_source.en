Restart the Talks on Cyprus 
Ever since Greek Cypriots rejected the United Nations plan to reunite Cyprus in 2004 , antagonism has grown between the Greek majority and the Turks in the north of the island . 
Turkish Cypriots have withdrawn into Turkey &apos;s embrace and have attempted to gain greater international recognition . 
Greek Cypriots are using their European Union membership as a weapon to frustrate Turkey &apos;s EU ambitions and to block attempts to increase trade between the EU and the island &apos;s north . 
The EU cannot let Cyprus stew in its own juice , not least because as a member state the island is proving an uncomfortable bedfellow . 
The whole of Cyprus joined the EU in May 2004 , but the acquis communautaire - the body of EU law - applies only to areas under direct government control , so it is suspended in those parts administered by Turkish Cypriots . 
The Turkish government , unwisely , became embroiled with the EU over its plan to extend the customs union to include all new member states , including Cyprus . 
Meanwhile , the EU has failed to deliver fully on aid and trade pledges to Turkish Cypriots . 
Perhaps most worrying of all , if the stalemate over Cyprus continues , it could end Turkey &apos;s chances of joining the EU , as Greek Cypriot intransigence has given succor to other member states that want to keep Turkey out . 
It might also prevent rapprochement between Greece and Turkey , despite the hopes raised by Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis &apos;s recent visit to Turkey - the first in almost a half-century . 
There are plenty of obstacles in the way of a negotiated solution to the Cyprus problem . 
Just over a year ago , the Finnish EU presidency failed to break the gridlock over the Cyprus trade issue , illustrating again the limited value of trying to agree partial solutions and &quot; confidence-building &quot; measures . 
The UN &apos;s latest initiative to get low-key , exploratory talks moving is going nowhere . 
Cypriot presidential elections this month may give a second term to Tasos Papadopoulos , the Greek Cypriot leader who led the &quot; No &quot; campaign in the 2004 reunification referendum . 
On the other hand , Turkey &apos;s recent elections returned the same pro-EU government that made a serious attempt to settle the Cyprus problem in 2004 . 
So it &apos;s not all gloom and doom . 
Some argue that it would be better to leave Cyprus alone and revisit the problem only in the closing stages of Turkey &apos;s EU accession . 
These voices are likely to become louder if Papadopoulos is re-elected . 
In my view , such a delay would be a mistake . 
Turkey would then have to conduct dual negotiations - over Cyprus and over its own EU accession . 
For Greek Cypriots , the failure of Turkey &apos;s accession talks in this way would also end any chance of resolving the Cyprus problem . 
Both Greek and Turkish Cypriots must take proper responsibility for any solutions that are negotiated and stand behind their decisions during any subsequent referendum campaign . 
All too often , Cypriots present themselves as helpless pawns in a wider game played by Greece , Turkey , or the &quot; great powers . &quot; 
There may have been some truth to this in the past , although never to the extent that many Cypriots believe . 
This time around , only genuine negotiations by both parties − and a mutually accepted settlement − are likely to stand the test of time . 
Given the island &apos;s complexity , and Cypriot sensitivity , it would be foolish for an outsider to try to sketch any future settlement . 
It would , however , seem safe to summarize certain elements at the outset . 
For example , it would be impractical to drop the basic framework of a bi-communal , bi-zonal federation , which was agreed by both sides as long ago as 1977 . 
Moreover , there seems little doubt that the final , rejected version of the UN &apos;s 2003-04 reunification plan will have to be changed , although earlier versions might contain ideas worth re-visiting . 
It may also be constructive to take advantage of transitional provisions linked to Turkey &apos;s EU accession . 
One earlier UN suggestion was that Turkey complete the withdrawal of its troops from Cyprus when it joined the EU . 
At the same time , there are concerns raised by one side that could be settled without any difficulty for the other side . 
Greek Cypriots were worried , for instance , about the tax bill for the last proposed settlement ; an agreement by the EU and other international players to subsidize the plan would cut the potential cost without affecting the Turkish community at all . 
The UN , the EU , Greece , Turkey , and UN Security Council members must be united in their support for any renewed effort to reach a settlement . 
Ever since UN peacekeepers were deployed in 1964 , the UN has been the only party acceptable to all sides as a &quot; midwife of compromise . &quot; 
While the EU must be present , it cannot be a neutral mediator , since Greece and Cyprus are both members . 
The Security Council must also give support to the UN &apos;s negotiators and guarantee the provisions of any settlement . 
This will help to avoid the kind of fears that surfaced in 2004 about implementation of the previous UN plan . 
Cyprus suffers from being a second-order problem , one that occasionally flares up , only to be damped down again with short-term palliatives . 
Many international diplomats are weary of the constant squabbles , endless setbacks , and stubbornness shown in previous negotiations . 
But neglect of Cyprus could have serious consequences , especially if its continued division keeps Turkey outside the EU . 
The future then would be fraught with tension in a part of the world where the EU needs to encourage peace and stability .
