The Political Consequences of Financial Crises 
LONDON - I may not be the only finance professor who , when setting essay topics for his or her students , has resorted to a question along the following lines : &quot; In your view , was the global financial crisis caused primarily by too much government intervention in financial markets , or by too little ? &quot; 
When confronted with this either / or question , my most recent class split three ways . 
Roughly a third , mesmerized by the meretricious appeal of the Efficient Market Hypothesis , argued that governments were the original sinners . 
Some even embraced the argument of the US libertarian Ron Paul , blaming the very existence of the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort . 
Another third , at the opposite end of the political spectrum , saw former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan as the villain . 
It was Greenspan &apos;s notorious reluctance to intervene in financial markets , even when leverage was growing dramatically and asset prices seemed to have lost touch with reality , that created the problem . 
More broadly , Western governments , with their light-touch approach to regulation , allowed markets to career out of control in the early years of this century . 
The remaining third tried to have it both ways , arguing that governments intervened too much in some areas , and too little in others . 
Avoiding the question as put is not a sound test-taking strategy ; but the students may have been onto something . 
Now that the crisis is seven years behind us , how have governments and voters in Europe and North America answered this important question ? 
Have they shown , by their actions , that they think financial markets need tighter controls or that , on the contrary , the state should repudiate bailouts and leave financial firms to face the full consequences of their own mistakes ? 
From their rhetoric and regulatory policies , it would appear that most governments have ended up in the third , fence-sitting camp . 
Yes , they have implemented a plethora of detailed controls , scrutinizing banks &quot; books with unprecedented intensity and insisting on approving cash distributions , the appointment of key directors , and even job descriptions for board members . 
But they have ruled out any future government or central-bank support for ailing financial institutions . 
Banks must now produce &quot; living wills &quot; showing how they can be wound down without the authorities &quot; support . 
The government will wash its hands of them if they run into trouble : the era of &quot; too big to fail &quot; is over . 
Perhaps this two-track approach was inevitable , though it would be good to know the desired end-point . 
Is it a system in which market discipline again dominates , or will regulators sit on the shoulders of management for the foreseeable future ? 
But what have voters concluded ? 
In the first wave of post-crisis elections , the message was clear in one sense , and clouded in another . 
Whichever government was in power when the crisis hit , whether left or right , was booted out and replaced by a government of the opposite political persuasion . 
That was not universally true - see Germany &apos;s Angela Merkel - but it certainly was true in the United States , the United Kingdom , France , and elsewhere . 
France moved from right to left , and the UK went from left to right . 
But voters &quot; verdict on their governments was more or less identical : things went wrong on your watch , so out you go . 
But now we can see a more consistent trend developing . 
Three German economists , Manuel Funke , Moritz Schularik , and Christoph Trebesch , have just produced a fascinating assessment based on more than 800 elections in Western countries over the last 150 years , the results of which they mapped against 100 financial crises . 
Their headline conclusion is stark : &quot; politics takes a hard right turn following financial crises . 
On average , far-right votes increase by about a third in the five years following systemic banking distress . &quot; 
The Great Depression of the 1930s , which followed the Wall Street crash of 1929 , is the most obvious and worrying example that comes to mind , but the trend can be observed even in the Scandinavian countries , following banking crises there in the early 1990s . 
So seeking to explain , say , the rise of the National Front in France in terms of President Fran√ßois Hollande &apos;s personal and political unpopularity is not sensible . 
There are greater forces at work than his exotic private life and inability to connect with voters . 
The second major conclusion that Funke , Schularik , and Trebesch draw is that governing becomes harder after financial crises , for two reasons . 
The rise of the far right lies alongside a political landscape that is typically fragmented , with more parties , and a lower share of the vote going to the governing party , whether of the left or the right . 
So decisive legislative action becomes more challenging . 
Control of the streets by government is not as secure . 
The average number of anti-government demonstrations triples , the frequency of violent riots doubles , and general strikes increase by at least a third . 
Greece has boosted those numbers recently . 
The only comforting conclusion that the three economists reach is that these effects gradually peter out . 
The data tell us that after five years , the worst is over . 
That does not seem to be the way things are moving now in Europe , if we look at France &apos;s recent election scare , not to mention Finland and Poland , where right-wing populists have now come to power . 
Maybe the answer is that the clock starts ticking on the five years when the crisis is fully over , which is not yet true in Europe . 
So politics seems set to remain a difficult trade for some time . 
And the bankers and financiers who are widely blamed for the crisis will remain in the sin bin for a while yet , until voters &quot; expectations of economic and financial stability are more consistently satisfied .
