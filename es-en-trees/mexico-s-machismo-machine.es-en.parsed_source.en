Mexico \ u0027s Machismo Machine 
Monica rummages frantically in her bag as we dine at a Mexico City restaurant . 
She pulls out her cell phone and checks for messages . 
&quot; Is anything wrong ? &quot; 
I ask . 
He becomes upset if he calls and I don &apos;t answer . 
I &apos;m always supposed to have my cell phone on - he likes to know where I am . &quot; 
&quot; You mean he likes to keep track of you , &quot; I say , and she laughs . 
As Monica explains , sheepishly , that Esteban is actually open-minded , it dawns on me that I &apos;ve been hearing a lot of similar stories recently , from female friends and patients . 
The cell phone has become a new way for men to keep tabs on their wives , calling them and pressuring them to come home as soon as possible . 
Machismo might be out of fashion in today &apos;s Mexico , but control is definitely in . 
You rarely hear of men not allowing their wives to study , work , or go out during the day . 
Almost 40 % of working-age women hold jobs , school and university enrollment is evenly split between the sexes , and the average wage differential , whereby women earn about 70 % of what men make , is comparable to that of industrialized nations . 
Women are increasingly aware of their rights , demanding equal treatment in the workplace and in politics . 
Under these conditions , machismo mutated . 
Nowadays , it relies more on psychological coercion and control than on discrimination or physical constraints . 
In a sense , machismo has gone underground . 
Deeply buried within our daily customs , it is all but invisible among the educated classes - invisible , but ever present . 
Women may be considered equal in many areas , but men remain more equal . 
In Mexico , women &apos;s time is not their own . 
When they go out , spend money , see friends , they are still expected to render accounts . 
Fathers , brothers , boyfriends , and husbands feel entitled to a detailed explanation of their everyday activities - but refuse to be questioned about their own . 
At home , men can say , &quot; Don &apos;t bother me now , I &apos;m watching TV &quot; ; women can &apos;t , because they are expected to be available , day and night , for their husband and children . 
These double standards form a pillar of today &apos;s machismo . 
Of course , it is far more evident in the privacy of the home than in the workplace or in public . 
Surveys show that men are willing to go to the supermarket once a week or mind the children for a while ; but they refuse to iron , sew , chop vegetables , or clean the oven or toilet , because these tasks are considered unmanly . 
Men help out , but within rigidly defined parameters . 
This division of labor in all areas of life means that men and women remain surprisingly inept at tasks assigned to the other sex . 
We see educated men who don &apos;t know how to make a cup of coffee , and professional women with no idea about how to change a fuse . 
Men know little about babies ; women know little about checkbooks - because they aren &apos;t supposed to . 
So machismo creates people with only half the skills that modern life requires . 
Far from creating a healthy complementarity between the sexes , it perpetuates dependence on both sides and creates widespread inefficiency . 
Part of the problem is the deep-seated assumption that women are meant to attend to men &apos;s needs . 
From the moment of their birth , men are surrounded by the constant care of women . 
Mothers , aunts , grandmothers , sisters , and later girlfriends , wives , and daughters are expected to fulfill - even anticipate - a man &apos;s every desire . 
Mothers tell little girls to &quot; attend &quot; their brothers , while little boys are instructed to &quot; watch over &quot; their sisters . 
This non-stop pampering is aggravated by female domestic servants , ranging from the high society governess to the part-time maid of a middle-class family . 
Servants , indeed , are a bulwark of Mexican machismo . 
Though they allow women to go out and work , they ensure that men continue to be pampered like oriental potentates , never lifting a finger in the home . 
Where wives and daughters now refuse to drop everything to prepare lunch for the man of the house , the maid takes up the slack . 
The implications of these attitudes and behaviors go beyond the domestic sphere . 
Pampered Mexican boys grow into men accustomed to being obeyed instantly , who feel entitled to special attention , refuse to negotiate with those whom they consider inferior , and reject any form of criticism . 
The men who dominate public life often fit this mold : they are demanding , impatient , intolerant , and self-centered . 
There is an inescapable contradiction between machismo and our supposed transition to democracy . 
As Monica sums it up with mock exasperation after our lunch , twice interrupted by her husband , &quot; This machismo business doesn &apos;t make sense any more . 
How can we continue to be governed by men who have never set foot in a supermarket ? &quot;
