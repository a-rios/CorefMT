Who Should Safeguard Financial Stability ? 
NEW HAVEN - Central bankers around the world failed to see the current financial crisis coming before its beginnings in 2007 . 
Martin Čihák of the International Monetary Fund reported in July 2007 that , of 47 central banks found to publish financial stability reports ( FSRs ) , &quot; virtually all &quot; gave a &quot; positive overall assessment of their domestic financial system &quot; in their most recent reports . 
And yet , although these central banks failed us before the crisis , they should still play the lead role in preventing the next crisis . 
That is the conclusion , perhaps counterintuitive , that the Squam Lake Group &#91; http : / / squamlakegroup.org / &#93; , a think tank of 15 academic financial economists to which I belong , reached in our recently published report , Fixing the Financial System . 
Macro-prudential regulators ( government officials who focus not on the soundness of individual financial institutions , but rather on the stability of the whole financial system ) are sorely needed , and central bankers are the logical people to fill this role . 
Other regulators did no better in predicting this crisis , and are even less suited to prevent the next . 
David Cameron &apos;s new government in the United Kingdom apparently came to the same conclusion when it announced plans to transfer regulatory authority from the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) to the Bank of England . 
But agreement about the regulatory role of central banks is not widely spread . 
In the United States , for example , there is recognition of the importance of macro-prudential regulation , but not of giving this authority to the Federal Reserve . 
The newly passed US financial-reform legislation entrusts macro-prudential policy to a new Financial Stability Oversight Council . 
That is good , but the US Treasury secretary will be the council &apos;s chairman , and the Fed , despite gaining some new powers , will for the most part be only one of many members . 
The head of the council is thus a political appointee who serves at the pleasure of the president . 
Recent history shows that political appointees often fail to take courageous or unpopular steps to stabilize the economy . 
A modern US president certainly remembers how difficult it was to convince voters to put him where he is , and is perpetually campaigning to maintain approval ratings and to preserve his party &apos;s prospects in the next election . 
The Treasury secretary is part of the president &apos;s team , and works next door to the White House . 
George W. Bush won the 2000 election , despite losing the popular vote . 
In 2003 , Bush chose as his Treasury secretary John W. Snow , a railroad president who , as Barron &apos;s columnist Alan Abelson put it , &quot; may not be the sharpest knife in the cabinet . &quot; 
Snow obliged the president and gave unquestioning support to his policies until leaving office in 2006 , just before the crisis erupted . 
Under the new law , Snow would have been in charge of the stability of the entire US economy . 
One theme that Bush found resonated with voters in his 2004 re-election campaign was that of the &quot; ownership society . &quot; 
A successful economy , Bush argued , requires that people learn to take responsibility for their actions , and policies aimed at boosting home ownership would inculcate this virtue on a broader scale . 
That sounded right to voters , especially if it meant government policies that encouraged the emerging real-estate bubble and made their investments in homes soar in value . 
Snow echoed his boss . 
&quot; The American economy is coiled like a spring and ready to go , &quot; he chirped in 2003 . 
Two years later , near the very height of the bubbles in the equity and housing markets , he declared that , &quot; We can be pleased that the economy is on a good and sustainable path . &quot; 
But , to Bush &apos;s credit , he also brought in Ben Bernanke in 2006 as Fed Chairman . 
Not part of Bush &apos;s team , Bernanke was protected from political pressures by America &apos;s long tradition of respect for the Fed &apos;s independence . 
The choice of Bernanke , an accomplished scholar , apparently reflected Bush &apos;s acceptance of the public &apos;s expectation of a first-rate appointee . 
The same problems occur in many other countries . 
People who are chosen in part to win the next election often find their economic judgment constrained . 
A news story in 2003 reported , for example , that Australian Secretary to the Treasury Ken Henry had warned of a &quot; housing bubble &quot; there , but then quickly tried to withdraw his comment , saying that it was &quot; not for quotation outside of this room . &quot; He did earlier this year finally propose new tax policy to slow the still-continuing Australian housing bubble , but now he can &apos;t get his government to implement it . 
By contrast , in recent decades central bankers in many countries have gradually won acceptance for the principle of independence from day-to-day political pressures . 
The public in much of the world now understands that central bankers will be allowed to do their work without interference from politicians . 
There is a tradition of the central banker as a worldly philosopher , who stands up for long-term sensible policy , and this tradition makes it politically easier for central bankers to do the right thing . 
In fact , while the world &apos;s central banks did not see the current crisis coming and did not take steps before 2007 to relieve the pressures that led to it , they did react decisively and energetically as the crisis unfolded , with coordinated international action . 
The crisis has underscored the utmost importance of macro-prudential regulation . 
Although our central bankers are not perfect judges of financial stability , they are still the people who are in the best political and institutional position to ensure it .
