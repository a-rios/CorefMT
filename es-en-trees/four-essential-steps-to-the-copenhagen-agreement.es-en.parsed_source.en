Four Essential Steps to the Copenhagen Agreement 
NEW YORK - The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen this year will be the moment in history when humanity can rise to the challenge and decisively deal with the issue . 
It is beyond the shadow of a doubt that greenhouse gas emissions must be radically reduced to prevent climate change from sliding into climate chaos . 
In 2007 , in Bali , the 192 Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change committed themselves to launching negotiations on strengthened action against climate change . 
This process is to culminate in an ambitious negotiated outcome at the end of 2009 , which needs to enter into force before January 2013 . 
This leaves just nine months to conclude one of the most complicated international negotiating processes in the world today . 
Last year , negotiators developed a better understanding of what they want from the different aspects of the action plan they agreed in Bali , and they gathered ideas and proposals . 
The political process has now reached a phase at which areas of convergence are emerging . 
These areas will form the basis of an initial draft agreement , to be presented in Bonn in June . 
In order to enter into force around the world before 2013 , the Copenhagen agreement must meet the political requirements of all participating countries . 
For this to happen , clarity on four key political points is needed this year . 
First , clarity is needed on ambitious , legally binding emission-reduction targets for industrialized countries . 
Without such targets , the international community will not take the necessary action to address climate change , and developing countries will not have confidence that industrialized countries are willing to take the lead on solving a problem that they caused . 
There are some positive signals in this direction . 
For example , the European Union has agreed to a climate and energy package with which it will be able to reach its target of a 20 % emission reduction over 1990 levels by 2020 ( 30 % if other industrialized countries follow suit. within the United States , President Barack Obama has indicated his intention to achieve an 80 % reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , and to return US emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 . 
Other countries , such as Russia and Japan , will announce their mid-term targets in the course of this year . 
Second , clarity is essential on the extent to which major developing countries can undertake nationally appropriate mitigation actions beyond what they are already doing . 
For many industrialized countries , particularly the US , it will be very difficult to conclude an agreement unless their citizens see that major developing countries are also willing to engage further . 
A number of developing countries , such as China , India , Brazil , and South Africa , have already developed national climate change or energy strategies that indicate the extent to which they feel that they are able , given their economic constraints , to address the issue . 
Many developing countries are coming forward with ideas for further nationally appropriate mitigation measures that they could take . 
Third , clarity is essential on financing . 
The magnitude of action by developing countries will largely depend on the effective delivery of finance and clean technology through international cooperative action . 
We need to know how significant financial resources will be generated to help developing countries both limit the growth of their emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change . 
Some interesting ideas have been floated . 
For example , industrialized countries have suggested auctioning emission rights and using part of the revenue for international cooperation - something that Germany is already doing . 
The concept also features in the Liebermann-Warner bill , an example of draft legislation on climate change for the US . 
Norway has put forward a proposal to monetize a portion of industrialized countries &quot; emissions budgets , generating revenue for international cooperation . 
Emissions trading and market-based mechanisms will continue to play a role . 
However , the Bali action plan addresses the need for developing countries to adopt nationally appropriate mitigation actions . 
Because the carbon market cannot be the sole instrument , government-to-government cooperation will be needed as well . 
Finally , clarity is essential on the governance structure under the convention . 
If significant financial resources are to be generated for mitigation and adaptation , developing countries will want a representative say in how that money is to be allocated and spent . 
The governance structures have to function according to democratic principles , founded on equity . 
Many other important concerns will feature in this year &apos;s intense negotiations . 
But clarity in these four areas will be essential for success at Copenhagen .
