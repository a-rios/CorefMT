Poison-Proofing China 
STANFORD - Last January , China &apos;s environmental authorities barely averted the contamination of nearly three million people &apos;s drinking water after a mining company dumped cadmium - a toxic heavy metal used in the manufacture of batteries , paint , solder , and solar cells - into the Longjiang River . 
To stop the contamination from spreading , the local fire department had to add significant quantities of dissolved aluminum chloride , which binds to cadmium and settles on the river bottom . The toxic sediment will eventually be dredged . 
Such threats to health and the environment are not uncommon in China . 
The water in as many as half of the country &apos;s rivers and lakes is unfit for human consumption or contact . 
China has also gained a reputation for food and drug contamination ( not to mention lead paint in toys and poisonous toothpaste ) . 
For example , in 2008 , the industrial chemical melamine was added to milk products in order to give falsely high readings of milk protein , causing the death of six infants and sickening 300,000 other people . 
Similarly , Mengniu , China &apos;s largest dairy company , announced last December that it had destroyed hazardous products at a plant in the Sichuan province after government safety inspectors discovered the carcinogen aflatoxin in a batch of its milk . 
( The company denied that any contaminated milk had reached consumers . ) 
In 2007 , melamine was deliberately added to an ingredient in pet food to enhance artificially its protein levels , causing renal failure in hundreds of cats and dogs in North America , Europe , and Africa . 
Later that year , diethylene glycol was mislabeled as non-toxic glycerin , then mixed into cold medicine , killing at least 100 people in Panama , including many children . 
The following year , crude precursors of the blood-thinning medication heparin were contaminated , causing hundreds of allergic reactions and 19 deaths in the United States , and at least 80 serious adverse health events in Germany . 
Eggs contaminated that year with melamine caused kidney stones and renal failure in children . 
Internal criticism of the Chinese government &apos;s management of health , safety , and overall quality-of-life issues is growing . 
In July 2011 , following the highly publicized crash of a supposedly state-of-the-art high-speed train in eastern China , Qiu Qiming , a news anchor for the national broadcaster CCTV , turned the disaster into a metaphor . 
&quot; China , please slow down . 
If you &apos;re too fast , you may leave the souls of your people behind . &quot; 
Given the pervasiveness of Chinese-made goods , China &apos;s safety record concerns consumers worldwide . 
But Chinese officials &quot; piecemeal efforts to restore confidence in the country &apos;s exports - for example , establishing limits for trace amounts of melamine in dairy products and tightening quality-control regulations for the dairy industry - are unlikely to reassure foreign consumers or importers . 
Indeed , Chinese policymakers seem unable to grasp the importance of crafting appropriate incentives and disincentives . 
Rather than adopting the Western model of motivating every link in the supply chain to adhere to specified quality and safety standards , the government continues to rely on top-down policies . 
But the decentralized , dispersed nature of many industries , the absence of an effective regulatory infrastructure , and the lack of firm-level inducements undermine the effectiveness of this approach . 
In fact , perverse incentives throughout the supply chain facilitate the widespread , systematic contamination of food and drugs . Both milk producers and heparin-precursor suppliers were motivated to add adulterants that would make their products appear to be of a higher quality than they actually were . 
To be sure , Chinese authorities face a daunting task . 
Only a few decades ago , China was a poor , largely rural country with an agrarian economy and almost no middle class . 
Today , it boasts the world &apos;s second-largest economy , a thriving manufacturing sector , and a rapidly growing , prosperous middle class , while more than half of China &apos;s 1.5 billion citizens now live in cities . 
Until relatively recently , environmental protection and consumer safety were secondary issues in the United States and Europe . 
In 1952 , London experienced five days of lethal , particulate-laden smog that killed 12,000 people and sickened more than 100,000 . 
And , in 1969 , America &apos;s heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught on fire . 
Just as Europe and the US have made substantial progress in implementing effective health and environmental policies , China &apos;s quality-control mechanisms can be improved . 
But , in tackling the issue , Chinese officials would do well to heed the proverb : &quot; With time and patience , the mulberry leaf becomes a silk gown . &quot;
