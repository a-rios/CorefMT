Restoring Yesterday \ u0027s Hope for Tomorrow \ u0027s World 
WASHINGTON , DC - The year 2015 was difficult , punctuated by declining growth forecasts , horrific terror attacks , massive refugee flows , and serious political challenges , with populism on the rise in many countries . 
In the Middle East , in particular , chaos and violence has continued to proliferate , with devastating consequences . 
This represents a disappointing turn from the undoubtedly flawed , but far more hopeful world of just a few decades ago . 
In his autobiography The World of Yesterday , Stefan Zweig described a similarly drastic change . 
Born in 1881 in Vienna , Zweig spent his youth in an optimistic , civil , and tolerant environment . 
Then , starting in 1914 , he witnessed Europe &apos;s collapse into World War I , followed by revolutionary convulsions , the Great Depression , the rise of Stalinism , and finally the barbarism of Nazism and the outbreak of World War II . 
Devastated , Zweig committed suicide while in exile in 1942 . 
One imagines that Zweig would have been comforted by the post-WWII creation of the United Nations and the Bretton-Woods system , not to mention the subsequent decades of reconstruction and reconciliation . 
He could have witnessed the cooperation and progress that marked the post-war era . 
Perhaps , then , he would have looked at the period from 1914 to 1945 as a terrible but limited detour in the world &apos;s march toward peace and prosperity . 
Of course , the second half of the twentieth century was far from perfect . 
Until 1990 , peace was secured largely by the threat of mutual nuclear destruction . 
Local conflicts , such as in Korea , Vietnam , parts of Africa , and the Middle East , took their toll . 
And while about 100 developing countries gained independence , the process was not always peaceful . 
At the same time , however , the world economy grew more rapidly than ever . 
A strong middle class emerged in the advanced countries , and then began to appear elsewhere . 
The Western democracies and Japan built economies in which productivity growth led to shared prosperity ; governments engaged in regulation and redistribution , while private companies fueled growth by implementing technologically advanced production methods . 
On both the regional and global levels , decisive progress was made in reaping the benefits from trade and economies of scale . 
The European integration project seemed to herald a new kind of cooperation , which could extend to other regions and even influence global cooperation . 
The generation that came of age in the 1960s felt much like Zweig had felt in his youth . 
We believed that , though progress may not be linear , we could count on it . 
We expected an increasingly peaceful and tolerant world , in which technological advances , together with well-governed markets , would generate ever-expanding prosperity . 
In 1989 , when the Soviet Union was poised to collapse and China was shifting to a market-based economy , Francis Fukuyama announced the &quot; end of history . &quot; 
Over the last two decades , however , our hopes - political , social , and economic - have been repeatedly dashed . 
There was a time when US policymakers were wondering whether Russia should join NATO . 
That possibility is difficult even to consider today , after Russia &apos;s intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea ( apparently carried out in response to fears that Ukraine would deepen its ties with the European Union and NATO ) . 
Many emerging economies achieved rapid growth for years - even decades - enabling billions of people to escape extreme poverty and reducing the wealth gap between developed and developing countries . 
But that growth has lately slowed substantially , leading many to question whether economists spoke too soon when we labeled them the new engines of global economic growth . 
Likewise , the Arab Spring in 2011 was supposed to herald a new , more democratic future for the Middle East and North Africa . 
While Tunisia has averted disaster , most of the other affected countries have ended up mired in chaos , with Syria &apos;s brutal civil war facilitating the rise of the Islamic State . 
The euro , meanwhile , suffered its own crisis . 
The common currency , once portrayed as the start of a quasi-federal Europe , instead created serious tension between &quot; creditor &quot; and &quot; debtor &quot; countries when many debtors faced a protracted economic downturn . 
Just as Europe seemed finally to be escaping the euro crisis , refugees , especially from Syria , began flooding in . 
That has jeopardized the Schengen Area of borderless travel , and some are asking whether the EU can withstand the pressure . 
In the United States , the Syrian refugee crisis has led Congress to rush to restrict visa-free entrance for tourists from 38 countries . 
This comes at a time when income and wealth inequality is skyrocketing in the US - the median wage for men has not increased in decades - leaving many to wonder whether their children will be able to maintain the living standard they enjoyed . 
On top of all this , for the first time in decades , the growth of international trade no longer comfortably exceeds the growth of global output . 
A fundamental driver of many of these problems may well be the unprecedented speed of change - driven by globalization and technological innovation - which has produced disruptions too quickly and on too large a scale for us to manage . 
For example , while communication technology has done wonders , say , to expand access to finance in Africa , it has also enabled terrorist networks to encrypt their communications effectively . 
And as the global financial crisis starkly demonstrated , regulators have struggled to keep pace with financial innovation . 
The potential for human progress still seems immense , because the world wants for neither resources nor technological innovation . 
Indeed , technology offers the hope of lifesaving medical treatments , higher economic productivity , and sustainable energy systems . 
But people are fearful , as shown by the return of identity politics and a lack of economic and political inclusiveness . 
As a result , productivity growth is slowing , and , though capital seems cheap and profits plentiful , investment remains sluggish . 
The key to managing the disruptions and assuaging people &apos;s fears is governance . 
Zweig saw the world fall apart a century ago not because human knowledge stopped advancing , but because of widespread governance and policy failures . 
As we enter 2016 , we must focus on adapting governance , in all of its economic and political dimensions , to the twenty-first century , so that our resources and knowledge produce inclusive progress , not violent conflict .
