The European Consequences of Germany &apos;s Election 
ISTANBUL - Nearly a century ago , in 1919 , John Maynard Keynes analyzed the economic consequences of the peace following Germany &apos;s defeat in World War I. To be sure , the consequences of Germany &apos;s general election on September 22 will not be nearly as momentous . 
But the outcome will not be as inconsequential as most analysts currently claim . 
For starters , even if the current Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) -Free Democrat Party ( FDP ) coalition forms the next government , Chancellor Angela Merkel could make longer-term and more courageous decisions without having to worry about the immediate electoral impact . 
She would be able to pursue a two- or three-year program , instead of her current four-week strategy . 
Merkel &apos;s post-election agenda might still be very cautious , emphasizing medium-term fiscal consolidation for Germany and the eurozone as a whole at the expense of boosting employment and growth . 
Moreover , even if Merkel leads the same political coalition , she would more strongly support eurozone schemes to encourage lending to small and medium-size enterprises , and European Union education programs , such as Erasmus . 
She would also be willing to work on institutional reforms aimed at closer coordination of EU member states &quot; economic policies . 
Finally , even within the CDU-FDP camp , there is growing recognition that Germany &apos;s enormous current-account surplus - above 6 % of GDP and the world &apos;s largest in absolute terms , at about $ 250 billion - means that Germans receive almost no return on about 25 % of their savings . 
Somewhat faster demand growth in Germany and a lower external surplus would help not only Germany &apos;s trade partners , but also German savers . 
Of course , the CDU-FDP coalition may not be returned to power . 
The other post-election scenarios are a grand coalition between the CDU and the Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) ; a red-green coalition between the SDP and the Greens ( if both do better than predicted and the liberal FDP falls below the 5 % electoral threshold ) , possibly with tacit support from the left-wing Die Linke ; or a CDU-Green coalition . 
In all three cases , the government would be more oriented toward European and eurozone integration than a renewed CDU-FDP administration would be . 
True , the German Constitutional Court has ruled out open-ended financial commitments over which the German parliament has no control , so Germany can go only so far in support of greater economic integration without greater political integration . 
Both parties are less complacent than the current government about the eurozone &apos;s stability and Europe &apos;s growth prospects . 
The German election will not produce a political earthquake and will not suddenly open the door to a federal Europe on the model of the United States , with large implicit fiscal transfers and highly centralized defense and foreign policies . 
A government that includes the SDP or the Greens - both of which have egalitarianism and internationalism in their DNA - would almost certainly go further and embrace substantial reform , renewal , and strengthening of eurozone institutions as a medium-term target . 
Such a government would back a eurozone strategy , led by Germany and France , that focuses on growth and employment , which would infuse some constructive enthusiasm into the 2014 European Parliament election . 
A German government coalition that includes the SDP or the Greens ( now a central player in German politics ) could thus accelerate the reform and integration that the eurozone needs .
