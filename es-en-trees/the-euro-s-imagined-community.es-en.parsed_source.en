The Euro &apos;s Imagined Community 
NEW HAVEN - Great significance - probably too much - has been attached to a possible breakup of the eurozone . 
Many believe that such a breakup - if , say , Greece abandoned the euro and reintroduced the drachma - would constitute a political failure that would ultimately threaten Europe &apos;s stability . 
Speaking before the Bundestag last October , German Chancellor Angela Merkel put the matter starkly : 
&quot; Nobody should believe that another half-century of peace and prosperity in Europe is guaranteed . 
It is not . 
So I say : If the euro fails , Europe fails . 
That must not happen . 
We have a historical obligation to protect by all prudent means at our disposal Europe &apos;s unification process begun by our forefathers more than fifty years ago after centuries of hatred and spilling of blood . 
None of us can foresee what the consequences would be if we were to fail . &quot; 
Europe has had more than 250 wars since the beginning of the Renaissance in the mid-fifteenth century . 
So , it is not alarmist to worry aloud about preserving the sense of community that Europe has enjoyed for the past half-century . 
In a fascinating , but largely overlooked book , How Enemies Become Friends , Charles A. Kupchan reviews many historical case studies of how nation-states with a long history of conflict managed eventually to become secure and peaceful friends . 
His examples include the formation of the Swiss Confederation ( 1291-1848 ) ; the creation of the Iroquois Confederation in the century or so before the first Europeans arrived in America ; the establishment of the United States ( 1776-1789 ) ; the unification of Italy ( 1861 ) , and of Germany ( 1871 ) ; the Norway-Sweden rapprochement ( 1905-1935 ) ; the formation of the United Arab Emirates ( 1971 ) ; and the Argentine-Brazilian rapprochement of the 1970 &quot; s . 
Kupchan also examines some notable failures of friendship : the United States &quot; Civil War ( 1861-65 ) ; the end of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance ( 1923 ) ; the breakdown of Sino-Soviet relations ( 1960 ) ; the demise of the United Arab Republic ( 1961 ) ; and the expulsion of Singapore from Malaysia ( 1965 ) . 
Kupchan never mentions a common currency as a condition of comity among nations ; in fact , economic integration tends to follow , rather than precede , achievement of political unity . 
Rather , he regards diplomatic engagement as the essential element to strategic accommodation and mutual trust , and this is more easily accomplished if the states have similar social orders and ethnicities . 
But Kupchan &apos;s analysis implies that a common currency can help nation-states to build lasting friendships , for he argues that friendship-building is most secure after an identity-changing &quot; narrative &quot; takes root , leading to a sense that the nations are like members of a family . 
A common currency can help to generate such a narrative . 
For example , the Iroquois tell the story of a great warrior and skilled orator named Hiawatha , who , traveling with the mystic Deganawidah , negotiated the treaties that established their confederation . 
He advocated new condolence ceremonies to commemorate lost warriors - and to replace wars of vengeance . 
The new narrative was reinforced with physical symbols , akin to a currency or a flag , in the form of belts of beads made of wampum , the Iroquois &quot; money . 
A surviving Hiawatha belt , dating from the eighteenth century ( and probably a copy of earlier belts ) , contains symbols of the five nations - Seneca , Cayuga , Onondaga , Oneida , and Mohawk - much as the US flag contains stars representing each of its states . 
The belt also preserves Hiawatha &apos;s status as the confederation &apos;s forefather . 
Flags may be a more inspiring symbol of common destiny , but most of us do not carry them around , and many people never display them , except perhaps at major sports events ; their origin , rooted in battle standards , can seem uncomfortably aggressive . 
There is a European Union flag , but it is rarely seen anywhere but outside of EU government buildings . 
A British schoolteacher expressed the sentiment well in 1910 : &quot; We suspect the man who talks patriotism and imperialism , just as we suspect him who talks religion or any of the things that are of deepest value in life . 
We think him either a humbug or a shallow person who has not realized the inadequacy of words to express what is deepest . &quot; 
And yet national currency , which we display every time we make a cash purchase , arouses no such suspicions . 
So currency works as a constant , if latent , reminder of identity . 
In using it , one has the psychological experience of participating with others in a common venture , and thus developing a sense of trust in both the endeavor and one &apos;s fellow-participants . 
Every currency union chooses symbols of common cultural values for its coins and notes , and these symbols become part of the sense of shared identity . 
We see the human faces on the notes so often that they come to seem like family , creating what the political scientist Benedict Anderson called the &quot; imagined community &quot; that underlies and sustains a sense of nationhood . 
The euro notes feature bridges as they appeared throughout Europe in various epochs , rather than images of actual structures that might seem to imply preferential regard for some countries . 
The town of Spijkenisse in the Netherlands is now in the process of building all seven bridges depicted on the euro notes . 
But the bridges remain symbols of European culture , in which presumably all Europeans share . 
Modern electronic technology will not eliminate paper notes and coins soon , so there is still plenty of time to make use of the symbolic value of a common currency . 
Indeed , even if the eurozone breaks up , each European country could adopt a different currency but retain common symbols . 
For example , there could be a Greek euro , a Spanish euro , etc . 
Even electronic transactions should be able to generate symbols of peace , trust , and unity . 
The point is that if Europe can keep these symbols alive , even a eurozone breakup would not have the dire political consequences for Europe that so many predict .
