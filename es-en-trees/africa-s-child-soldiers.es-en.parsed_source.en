Africa \ u0027s Child Soldiers 
As a boy , when you join an army , you think you are going to see war as in the movies . 
It &apos;s not like that . 
In my first combat , I thought I was going to die , that I would never see my mother again . 
Project Syndicate needs your help to provide readers everywhere equal access to the ideas and debates shaping their lives . It was the mid-1980s , and we were attacking a fortified garrison in western Uganda . 
I was 15 years old and part of a movement that aimed to rid my country of the corrupt regime of Milton Obote , who had succeeded the murderous Idi Amin . 
My leader was an inspiring , brave and talented man , Yoweri Museveni , now Uganda &apos;s President . 
Museveni believed that young fighters not only needed martial skills but also a political awareness of the cause for which they fought - an end to the greed and self-delusion of Africa &apos;s post-independence leadership . 
While still a teenager , I learned that the goal of war was social and political transformation . 
In battle , I came to pity enemy prisoners because I had a cause to fight for and they did not . 
Motivated by a political agenda - renovation of my battered country - I rose through the ranks to become a trusted aide in the circle around Museveni . 
In 1986 , not long after my 16 
No longer a rebel but now a leader in the Ugandan army , I was sent for military training to Cuba , Libya and North Korea . 
I became an expert in tank warfare . 
While I hungered for an education - and even enrolled at university - I remained valuable as a soldier . 
First , in my country , I helped Tutsi refugees from Rwanda , where they were a minority , fight a war against the Hutu majority there . 
In the summer of 1994 , when the Hutus slaughtered the Tutsis by the hundreds of thousands , our cause grew in urgency , as did our fighting spirit . 
For three years I fought alongside Tutsis , finally serving as personal aide to Paul Kagame , now Rwanda &apos;s president and his country &apos;s leading political and military strategist . 
Soon President Kagame asked me to fight in the Congo in order to bring an end to the monumentally corrupt regime of Mobutu . 
In the Congo I led hundreds of fighters - many of them children - and helped capture pieces of the country . 
In May 1997 , I even helped to capture Kinshasa and chase Mobutu from power . 
I had &quot; liberated &quot; a third country , and I was only 27 years old . 
Tired of war , the following year I turned politician , winning a seat in parliament as a member of Museveni &apos;s &quot; Movement &quot; group , the only legal party in Uganda . 
Last year , I began to fear that Museveni had become yet another African dictator , more concerned with power than principle . 
Part of my quarrel with him concerned his failure to establish a genuine multi-party democracy ; also , I objected to mounting corruption . 
The World Bank and other foreign donors supply half of the Ugandan government &apos;s budget , but a third of the money is wasted on senseless military actions such as Uganda &apos;s invasion of the Congo . 
Museveni holds ultimate responsibility for this corruption . 
I defected to a new opposition party and campaigned on behalf of Museveni &apos;s opponent in last year &apos;s presidential election . 
Even though Museveni faced no risk of losing , he took no chances , arresting his opponent &apos;s aids and supporters . 
Though I had fought faithfully in Museveni &apos;s army as a child , I was now an adult and a critic , so he arrested me too . 
Tortured by my own brother ( Museveni &apos;s chief of internal security ) , I was released after local and international pressure , and I left Uganda for Britain . 
In tranquil London , I now contemplate my life as a child soldier . 
I have no regrets , I offer no apologies . 
Yet I am aware of how human rights advocates deplore the enlistment of youth into Africa &apos;s wars , where the lives of many children are ruined . 
Injustice provokes children to pick up guns . 
So does poverty . 
In parts of Africa , poverty means that youth look at guns as a way of earning a living . 
Powerless politically and economically , some children feel that they can only assert themselves by joining an army . 
In Uganda , and in most other sub-Saharan countries , more than 40 % of the population is under the age of 15 . 
Every country groans under the burden of educating , employing and absorbing so many young people . 
Of course , no child should go to war . 
Only education will . 
African youth must be introduced to democracy and pacifism in the classroom . 
When a child picks up a gun , he becomes a man and inspires fear , if not respect . 
In my experience , African youth are forgotten except when politicians need them for battle . 
If African youth are given a better education and the means to influence their communities , then they will be less likely to be used as cannon-fodder , less likely to pick up a gun , and more likely to read a book . 
Seventeen years ago , against the wishes of my father , I picked up a gun , hoping to change the world . 
I survived and learned . 
I learned the limits of the gun . 
Many of my comrades were robbed of that chance , for few remain alive . 
Of those living , most hold senior posts in the Ugandan army ; a few are in politics . 
Yet most died in combat or of AIDS . 
Young Africans should remember this when they look for ways to make their mark .
