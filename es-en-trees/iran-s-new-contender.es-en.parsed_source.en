Iran &apos;s New Contender 
WASHINGTON , DC - Iran &apos;s presidential race just got more interesting , with former Prime Minister Mir Hussein Mousavi throwing his hat in the ring and former President Mohammad Khatami withdrawing his . 
This development poses the most significant challenge yet to current President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad - and a potential opportunity to alter the relationship between Iran and the West . 
Mousavi , who believes that Iran is in &quot; poor shape , &quot; is perceived by many of the Iranian elite to possess the revolutionary and ideological credentials to run against Islamist fundamentalists such as Ahmadinejad . 
At the same time , he is associated with Iranian reformists , who believe that Iran must enact major domestic and foreign policy changes to escape its economic crisis and international isolation . 
A Mousavi presidency could lead to foreign policies that incorporate engagement with the United States and European Union on a number of issues , including Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
However , Mousavi will face many obstacles in the months leading up to the June 12 vote , and he will succeed only if allowed to by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . 
Mousavi was an important part of the revolutionary movement that overthrew the Shah in 1979 . 
As Prime Minister from 1981 to 1989 , he was credited for steering Iran through the crises of the early revolutionary period and the Iran-Iraq war . 
Widely viewed as a capable technocrat , Mousavi has often been able to navigate Iran &apos;s complicated economic and political maze . 
He appeared to have abandoned an active role in politics after his post was abolished in 1989 . 
But now he has ostensibly resurfaced , like a Persian Cincinnatus , to help Iran in its hour of need . 
Iran under Ahmadinejad is facing its worst economic crisis in decades . 
Ahmadinejad maintains some support among the poor and rural classes , but he is viewed with disdain by much of the ruling class , even within his own political camp . 
His economic failures have highlighted the need for a more moderate and capable president . 
Former President Khatami , meanwhile , is reviled by the fundamentalists and the top brass of the Revolutionary Guards , who repeatedly obstructed his reform agenda during his presidency . 
A recent op-ed in the right-wing Kayhan newspaper , which is closely associated with Khamenei , had warned Khatami to avoid the same fate as the assassinated Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan . 
It is no surprise that he backed out of the race , leaving Mousavi , a technocrat and a revolutionary , as the only viable challenger to Ahmadinejad . 
But change does not come easily to Iran . 
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is wary of Mousavi , who served as Prime Minister during Khamenei &apos;s presidency in the 1980 &quot; s . 
The two were often at odds over economic , social , and religious policies . 
Ahmadinejad , by contrast , has been loyal to Khamenei and has largely followed his policies over the past four years . 
In Khamenei &apos;s eyes , it was Ahmadinejad who kept Khamenei &apos;s reformist opponents at bay and resisted President George W. Bush &apos;s attempt to &quot; dominate &quot; Iran and the Middle East . 
A perceived change in American &quot; behavior &quot; under the Obama administration may facilitate Khamenei &apos;s support for , or at least acquiescence in , an electoral victory by Mousavi . 
Khamenei may be fundamentally opposed to full US-Iranian relations , but a new Iranian president may provide some cover for limited accommodations , including perhaps on the nuclear front . 
Mousavi is the man to watch . 
The dominant actors - Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guards - will continue to exert potentially decisive influence .
