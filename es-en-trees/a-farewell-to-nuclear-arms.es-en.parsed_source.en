A Farewell to Nuclear Arms 
MOSCOW - Twenty-five years ago this month , I sat across from Ronald Reagan in Reykjavik , Iceland to negotiate a deal that would have reduced , and could have ultimately eliminated by 2000 , the fearsome arsenals of nuclear weapons held by the United States and the Soviet Union . 
For all our differences , Reagan and I shared the strong conviction that civilized countries should not make such barbaric weapons the linchpin of their security . 
Even though we failed to achieve our highest aspirations in Reykjavik , the summit was nonetheless , in the words of my former counterpart , &quot; a major turning point in the quest for a safer and secure world . &quot; 
The next few years may well determine if our shared dream of ridding the world of nuclear weapons will ever be realized . 
Critics present nuclear disarmament as unrealistic at best , and a risky utopian dream at worst . 
They point to the Cold War &apos;s &quot; long peace &quot; as proof that nuclear deterrence is the only means of staving off a major war . 
As someone who has commanded these weapons , I strongly disagree . 
Nuclear deterrence has always been a hard and brittle guarantor of peace . 
By failing to propose a compelling plan for nuclear disarmament , the US , Russia , and the remaining nuclear powers are promoting through inaction a future in which nuclear weapons will inevitably be used . 
That catastrophe must be forestalled . 
As I , along with George P. Shultz , William J. Perry , Henry A. Kissinger , Sam Nunn , and others , pointed out five years ago , nuclear deterrence becomes less reliable and more risky as the number of nuclear-armed states increases . 
Barring preemptive war ( which has proven counterproductive ) or effective sanctions ( which have thus far proven insufficient ) , only sincere steps toward nuclear disarmament can furnish the mutual security needed to forge tough compromises on arms control and nonproliferation matters . 
The trust and understanding built at Reykjavik paved the way for two historic treaties . 
The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces ( INF ) Treaty destroyed the feared quick-strike missiles then threatening Europe &apos;s peace . 
But prospects for progress on arms control and nonproliferation are darkening in the absence of a credible push for nuclear disarmament . 
I learned during those two long days in Reykjavik that disarmament talks could be as constructive as they are arduous . 
By linking an array of interrelated matters , Reagan and I built the trust and understanding needed to moderate a nuclear-arms race of which we had lost control . 
In retrospect , the Cold War &apos;s end heralded the coming of a messier arrangement of global power and persuasion . 
The nuclear powers should adhere to the requirements of the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty and resume &quot; good faith &quot; negotiations for disarmament . 
Only a serious program of universal nuclear disarmament can provide the reassurance and the credibility needed to build a global consensus that nuclear deterrence is a dead doctrine . 
We can no longer afford , politically or financially , the discriminatory nature of the current system of nuclear &quot; haves &quot; and &quot; have-nots . &quot; 
Reykjavik proved that boldness is rewarded . 
Conditions were far from favorable for a disarmament deal in 1986 . 
Before I became Soviet leader in 1985 , relations between the Cold War superpowers had hit rock bottom . 
Reagan and I were nonetheless able to create a reservoir of constructive spirit through constant outreach and face-to-face interaction . 
What seem to be lacking today are leaders with the boldness and vision to build the trust needed to reintroduce nuclear disarmament as the centerpiece of a peaceful global order . 
Economic constraints and the Chernobyl disaster helped spur us to action . 
Why has the Great Recession and the disastrous meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in Japan not elicited a similar response today ? 
A first step would be for the US finally to ratify the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) . 
President Barack Obama has endorsed this treaty as a vital instrument to discourage proliferation and avert nuclear war . 
It &apos;s time for Obama to make good on commitments he made in Prague in 2009 , take up Reagan &apos;s mantle as Great Communicator , and persuade the US Senate to formalize America &apos;s adherence to the CTBT . 
This would compel the remaining holdouts - China , Egypt , India , Indonesia , Iran , Israel , North Korea , and Pakistan - to reconsider the CTBT as well . 
A second necessary step is for the US and Russia to follow up on the New START agreement and begin deeper weapons cuts , especially tactical and reserve weapons , which serve no purpose , waste funds , and threaten security . 
This step must be related to limits on missile defense , one of the key issues that undermined the Reykjavik summit . 
A fissile material cut-off treaty ( FMCT ) , long stalled in multilateral talks in Geneva , and a successful second Nuclear Security Summit next year in Seoul , will help secure dangerous nuclear materials . 
This will also require that the 2002 Global Partnership , dedicated to securing and eliminating all weapons of mass destruction - nuclear , chemical , and biological - is renewed and expanded when it convenes next year in the US . 
Our world remains too militarized . 
In today &apos;s economic climate , nuclear weapons have become loathsome money pits . 
If , as seems likely , economic troubles continue , the US , Russia , and other nuclear powers should seize the moment to launch multilateral arms reductions through new or existing channels such as the UN Conference on Disarmament . 
These deliberations would yield greater security for less money . 
But the buildup of conventional military forces - driven in large part by the enormous military might deployed globally by the US - must be addressed as well . 
US President John F. Kennedy once warned that &quot; every man , woman , and child lives under a nuclear sword of Damocles , hanging by the slenderest of threads , capable of being cut at any moment . &quot; 
For more than 50 years , humanity has warily eyed that lethal pendulum while statesmen debated how to mend its fraying cords . 
Our efforts 25 years ago can be vindicated only when the Bomb ends up beside the slave trader &apos;s manacles and the Great War &apos;s mustard gas in the museum of bygone savagery .
