The Tragedy of Zidane 
Those who the gods may destroy , they grant their wishes . 
Zinedine Zidane may be pondering that bit of ancient Greek wisdom today . 
Having announced that he would end his professional career with the World Cup , Zidane had his wish fulfilled . 
After France barely survived the tournament &apos;s first round , Zidane performed at the top of his game and led the team to the brink of a second World Cup championship . 
There have been few such tragic moments in football history . 
Whatever the provocation that led to Zidane &apos;s behavior ( probably a racial comment ) , his violent act , seen around the world , has tarnished his image . 
The sad paradox is that while the world had been learning of and celebrating his legendary kindness as a person , he will now be distinguished for all time by an act of aggression . 
Indeed , Zidane &apos;s status as an emblematic champion of the world &apos;s most universal and popular sport does not fully explain why people have been so obsessed with him . 
His human qualities , as much as his talent and technical feats on the field , counted equally in establishing his popular acclaim . 
Football has always been this way . 
For Argentineans , the diminutive Diego Maradona represented the revenge of the weak and the deprived . 
As a result , his countrymen excused his frequent bad behavior time and again . 
Similarly , Pel√© became the symbol of a harmonious , inter-racial Brazil . 
Zidane offered neither of these romantic images . 
Moreover , after his career is over , he is unlikely to become a manager of his sport like Jean-Claude Killy , the former Alpine skier who was co-president of the 1992 winter Olympics , or his fellow football legend Michel Platini , who helped coordinate the 1998 World Cup . 
After all , Zidane , arguably the world &apos;s best football player , left with a gesture that has no place in any game . 
Nevertheless , Zidane will remain a global icon , owing to his profoundly human character and his extreme simplicity . 
Here is a man who is known in the most hidden corners of the planet , yet he retained the presence and discretion of a silent next-door neighbor . 
At a moment when integration is being debated in France , Zidane embodied the ideal of success through talent and hard work - while never betraying himself or his Algerian origins . 
Moreover , Zidane incarnated values that seem threatened nowadays , but to which ordinary people remain attached : loyalty to family , diligence , and cooperation . 
Here is a man who was not only a world champion , but also a model son and father . 
The almost timid way in which , after France &apos;s victory over Spain , he expressed his love for his mother touched viewers around the world . 
To understand Zidane &apos;s popularity , one need only set his modesty and attention to others against the arrogance and indifference that characterize the behavior of so many other celebrities , including football players . 
At a time when , in France as in the rest of the world , the chasm between the elite and ordinary people has never been so wide , when the smugness of the affluent has never been so cruelly felt by the less fortunate , Zidane , a son of despised immigrants , became an international star , and yet preserved the simplicity of his origins . 
For this , Zidane was not only admired , but also respected . 
His success was never to the detriment of others . 
On the contrary , he is active in causes such as helping sick children . 
It is obvious that he could one day become a tremendous ambassador of peace , or for children , working with the United Nations or another international organization . 
But now the hero has fallen . 
Zidane was not Superman , but a human being . 
In a single instant of unfathomable fury , his moment of glory was transformed into one of madness and a curse . 
His tragedy is ultimately a personal one . 
Nevertheless , it would be a great loss - extending far beyond the world of football - if Zidane &apos;s disgraceful exit as a player comes to define his legacy as a man .
