Mine Your Digital Business 
BOSTON - Nearly everyone has a digital footprint - the trail of so-called &quot; passive data &quot; that is produced when you engage in any online interaction , such as with branded content on social media , or perform any digital transaction , like purchasing something with a credit card . 
A few seconds ago , you may have generated passive data by clicking on a link to read this article . 
Passive data , as the name suggests , are not generated consciously ; they are by-products of our everyday technological existence . 
As a result , this information - and its intrinsic monetary value - often goes unnoticed by Internet users . 
But the potential of passive data is not lost on companies . 
They recognize that such information , like a raw material , can be mined and used in many different ways . 
For example , by analyzing users &quot; browser history , firms can predict what kinds of advertisements they might respond to or what kinds of products they are likely to purchase . 
Even health-care organizations are getting in on the action , using a community &apos;s purchasing patterns to predict , say , an influenza outbreak . 
Indeed , an entire industry of businesses - which operate rather euphemistically as &quot; data-management platforms &quot; - now captures individual users &quot; passive data and extracts hundreds of billions of dollars from it . 
According to the Data-Driven Marketing Institute , the data-mining industry generated $ 156 billion in revenue in 2012 - roughly $ 60 for each of the world &apos;s 2.5 billion Internet users . 
As impressive as this figure sounds , it is just the first step for the data economy . 
By 2020 , the global Internet population will reach five billion ; ten billion new machine-to-machine connections will be created ; and mobile data traffic will rise 11-fold . 
Given the dramatic growth in the amount of data being generated , together with ever-expanding applications across industries , it is reasonable to expect that individual data will soon be worth more than $ 100 per Internet user . 
Within ten years , the data-capture industry can be expected to generate more than $ 500 billion annually . 
Based on these projections , one might wonder what kind of compensation the creators of this multibillion-dollar data can expect . 
As it stands , the answer is none at all . 
Individual users are at the bottom of a broken economy . 
The value that their data generate is being collected by third parties , and sold to whatever cash-rich organization is willing to purchase it . 
This does not have to be the case . 
The first step toward reclaiming some of the value of our own data is to view this information as an asset , rather than as a by-product . 
At that point , Internet users can find ways to take control of their own creation . 
Already , Facebook users can export all of their personal data as a zip file simply by clicking a link on their profiles . 
Presumably , they could sell that information directly to the organizations that want it , instead of allowing Facebook to do so . 
Of course , the data market does not yet exist on this scale . 
But , as Facebook &apos;s data-export facility demonstrates , a new model that turns data into an asset and consumers into producers is not a distant prospect . 
Such a model would empower billions of Internet users by making them beneficiaries of a transactional exchange - one that adds value in every direction . 
Beyond enabling individual Internet users to monetize their data , this model would benefit data buyers by connecting them more closely to consumers - not least by diminishing the mistrust that can arise when users are not complicit in the sharing and use of their data . 
Indeed , firms that acknowledge that personal data are personal property will be in a better position to build relationships with individual consumers , thereby gaining deeper insights into their specific needs and desires . 
If passive data are worth hundreds of billions of dollars when sold by third parties , the data that individuals choose to share - reliable , honest insights into their motivations as consumers - should be worth much more . 
By recognizing the individuals behind the data , companies can access and share in that value , within a fully inclusive data economy . 
Personal data is exactly that - personal . 
People should choose whether to share it , and they should be able to share it on their own terms .
