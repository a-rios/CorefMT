Liberia Now , Zimbabwe Next ? 
President Charles Taylor &apos;s resignation from Liberia &apos;s presidency and his exile in Nigeria is not only a welcome relief for the war-torn land he so misruled , but also perhaps a bellwether for other discredited dictators . 
Indeed , Zimbabwe &apos;s elderly President Robert Mugabe , who is 79 , must now be reckoning with the inevitability of his own political demise . 
True , no rebel troops are yet besieging Harare , no US warship with 2000 marines hovers on the horizon , and President George W. Bush has not demanded that President Robert Mugabe step down after 23 years in office . 
But there are nonetheless striking similarities in the crises that have bedeviled the two African nations . 
Those similarities are providing Zimbabwe &apos;s citizens with the hope that they may soon see the back of Mugabe . 
Before going into exile , Taylor turned over the presidency to his long-time ally , Vice President Moses Z. Blah , who is to rule until a new transitional government takes over . 
Similarly , Mugabe is known to favor transferring power to an interim government led by his long-time ally , Emmerson Mnangagwa , if he decides that the time has come to step down . 
Like Blah , Mnangagwa is widely unpopular , and he lost his parliamentary seat in the 2001 general election . 
Mugabe , however , immediately appointed Mnangagwa , who is much feared and often linked to allegations of corruption , as Speaker of Parliament . 
Moreover , like his West African counterpart , Mugabe has presided over a decaying economy and a restless population . 
His regime survives only through a ruthless campaign of terror conducted by the army , of which Mugabe is commander-in-chief ; the police force , whose commander publicly declares political allegiance to Mugabe ; the dreaded Central Intelligence Organization , which Mnangagwa headed for many years ; and , of late , the ill-trained and brutal youth militia , whose loyalty to the ruling party is unflinching . 
In Liberia , Bush called for Taylor &apos;s resignation as a precondition for constructive dialogue and a more active involvement by the US in seeking a peaceful solution to the 15 years of internecine war that ruined the country &apos;s economy and infrastructure , as well inciting wars in most of its neighbors . 
In Zimbabwe , Bush has not said or done anything so drastic . 
But US Secretary of State Colin Powell has accused Mugabe of &quot; violent misrule &quot; and called his government a &quot; ruthless regime . &quot; 
According to Powell , &quot; If leaders on the continent do not do more to convince President Robert Mugabe to respect the rule of law and enter into a dialogue with the political opposition , he and his cronies will drag Zimbabwe down until there is nothing left to ruin . &quot; 
Zimbabweans were surprised , therefore , when Bush , during his recent tour of Africa , expressed satisfaction with the negotiations said to be taking place between Mugabe &apos;s Zanu PF party and its arch-rival , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , led by opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai . 
Bush expressed satisfaction with the mediating role played by South African President Thabo Mbeki , whose ineffectual &quot; quiet diplomacy &quot; has left Zimbabweans both weary and suspicious . 
In an emotional address during a ceremony earlier this month to commemorate heroes of Zimbabwe &apos;s war of liberation from white minority rule , Mugabe warned the opposition : &quot; Those who would go together with our enemies abroad cannot at the same time want to march alongside us as our partners in the nation-building efforts that are underway . &quot; 
Mr. Taylor and Mr. Mugabe both blame the West for their countries &apos; woes . 
Mr. Mugabe routinely denounces the MDC as &quot; the enemy , &quot; claiming that the party is controlled by the British and American governments , who are allegedly hell-bent on re-colonizing Zimbabwe . 
President Mbeki was one of the three heads of state present at the handover ceremony from Taylor to Blah in Monrovia , Liberia &apos;s capital . 
He may have had more than the departing Taylor in mind when he said , &quot; It has indeed been a shameful thing that , as Africans , we have killed ourselves for such a long time . &quot; 
Mbeki &apos;s own brother , Moeletsi Mbeki , who heads the South Africa Institute for International Affairs , has a more forthright view of the political mayhem in Zimbabwe and the tardy pace of efforts to arrest the situation . &quot; Here &apos;s a guy breaking all the rules of democracy , &quot; he says , referring to Mugabe , &quot; and no African government is stepping forward and saying , &apos; It &apos;s time for you to go . &quot; &apos; 
It is to be hoped that Taylor &apos;s departure heralds the beginning of a new African era , in which Africa &apos;s rulers stop protecting the continent &apos;s dictators because they would rather incur the wrath of faceless citizens than expel a dictator from among their ranks . 
If so , leaders such as Mbeki will emerge as heroes for a new Africa , where intervention in neighboring states will protect the millions on the continent who remain subjugated by elderly dictators like Mugabe , who have exploited their position as anti-colonial liberation leaders , and younger , free-booting adventurers like Taylor . 
Only then will Africa &apos;s tolerance for tyrants be ended .
