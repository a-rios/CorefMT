A Movable Financial Feast 
LONDON - There was a time when league tables were to be found only on the sports pages of newspapers . 
Now they are a global obsession . 
There are school and university league tables , rankings of companies on profitability or corporate social responsibility , tables of happiness indicators by country , and tables that attempt to rank consumer brands by value . 
There is even a league table of the world &apos;s funniest jokes ( I did not laugh much ) . 
The financial world is also full of such rankings . 
Investment bankers wait with bated breath for the merger and acquisition league tables , even though the link between a high ranking and profitability is somewhere between loose and non-existent . 
Bank league tables have been with us for a while , and now tend to be based on capital strength , rather than asset volume , which is an improvement of sorts , but still not very meaningful . 
There are also now several different league tables - which are generating considerable angst - that rank financial centers based largely on surveys of firms . 
How badly the financial crisis damaged the reputation and performance of the major Western centers is a question increasingly asked in London , and to a lesser extent in New York . 
( Some Americans tend to think that the world will beat a path to their door , no matter how badly they are received when they arrive ! ) 
So far , the message from the most recent tables is not too alarming for the incumbents . 
A ranking prepared for the City Corporation in London shows New York and London still neck and neck at the top of the league . 
The Banker magazine produces another , with New York on top and London a close second - though the distance between them and their pursuers is narrowing . 
The scores in both London and New York for the quality and intensity of regulation , and the tax burden , have dropped . 
Firms seem nervous about the future in both areas . 
The most striking change in the rankings is the rise of major Asian financial centers - and not just Hong Kong and Singapore , but also Shanghai , Beijing , and Shenzhen . 
The Chinese have been explicitly promoting their financial centers , and the impact is beginning to be seen . 
The World Economic Forum &apos;s Financial Development Index - yet another league table to consider - shows Hong Kong and Singapore very close indeed to London , with China now ahead of Italy on the overall measure of financial sophistication . 
Noodles are beating spaghetti . 
Some of this is unsurprising . 
As the world &apos;s center of economic gravity shifts east , the balance of financial activity is bound to move with it . 
On the principle that if something is inevitable , it is wise to welcome it , the appropriate response in London and New York is to find ways of collaborating with these new centers . 
But the more important question for the traditional financial centers is whether international activity that can move really is moving . 
That is far harder to judge . 
There are anecdotes about individual hedge-fund managers moving to Geneva . 
Every time a government , or a regulator , announces some new control , or a tightening of existing controls , there are threats from bankers that they will pack up and leave town , taking their Porsches and mistresses with them . 
These threats , which used to have a lot of political impact , are now much less effective . 
Some politicians and commentators quickly say , &quot; Good riddance . &quot; 
Even the Bank of England has asked whether , given the cost of mopping up the mess caused by the latest crisis , it is worth playing host to a global financial market . 
This is risky speculation . 
However badly bankers have behaved - and some clearly deserve a decade or more in the sin bin - financial services are a crucial element of London &apos;s economy . 
If the financial sector declines , what will replace it in employment terms ? 
Airy talk about science and manufacturing as ladders out of recession ( a favorite image of former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown ) is just that - empty words . 
There are few , if any , examples of high-cost post-industrial societies reviving their manufacturing sector on a large scale once it has declined . 
London , in particular , has no inalienable right to be a global financial center . 
The United Kingdom &apos;s domestic market is , after all , much smaller than that of the United States . 
Indeed , the location of financial activity has changed through the centuries . 
If incumbency were a permanent advantage , Goldman Sachs &quot; global headquarters would be in Babylon . 
There must be a tipping point at which some combination of higher taxation , more burdensome regulation , and a hostile political climate causes financial firms to relocate . 
There is a risk that Britain may now be approaching that point . 
That is why the UK &apos;s Financial Services Authority , and even the Confederation of British Industry , which speaks largely for non-financial firms concerned about access to credit , has begun to call for a truce between the authorities and financial markets . 
The next two or three months will determine whether peace breaks out , and , if it does , whether it will endure . 
As is always the case in peace negotiations , both sides must be willing to compromise . 
Firms will need to show visible restraint when it comes to this year &apos;s bonus round . 
The British government will not tolerate another jamboree . 
And governments on both sides of the Atlantic will need to decide just how far they want to go in punishing banks . 
Continued threats of ever-higher tax burdens could prove dangerously counterproductive . 
If we fail to settle on a new social contract between the state and the markets soon , those markets may indeed move elsewhere .
