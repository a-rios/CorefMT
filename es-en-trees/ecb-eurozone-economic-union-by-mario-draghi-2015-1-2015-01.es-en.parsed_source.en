Stability and Prosperity in Monetary Union 
FRANKFURT - There is a common misconception that the euro area is a monetary union without a political union . 
Monetary union is possible only because of the substantial integration already achieved among European Union countries - and sharing a single currency deepens that integration . 
If European monetary union has proved more resilient than many thought , it is only because those who doubted it misjudged this political dimension . 
They underestimated the ties among its members , how much they had collectively invested , and their willingness to come together to solve common problems when it mattered most . 
Yet it is also clear that our monetary union is still incomplete . 
This was the diagnosis offered two years ago by the so-called &quot; Four Presidents &quot; ( the European council president in close collaboration with the presidents of the European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the Eurogroup ) . 
And , though important progress has been made in some areas , unfinished business remains in others . 
But what does it mean to &quot; complete &quot; a monetary union ? 
Most important , it means having conditions in place that make countries more stable and prosperous than they would be if they were not members . 
They have to be better off inside than they would be outside . 
In other political unions , cohesion is maintained through a strong common identity , but often also through permanent fiscal transfers between richer and poorer regions that even out incomes ex post . 
In the euro area , such one-way transfers between countries are not foreseen ( transfers do exist as part of the EU &apos;s cohesion policy , but are limited in size and are primarily designed to support the &quot; catching-up &quot; process in lower income countries or regions ) . 
This means that we need a different approach to ensure that each country is permanently better off inside the euro area . 
This implies two main things . 
First , we have to create the conditions for all countries to thrive independently . 
All members need to be able to exploit comparative advantages within the Single Market , attract capital , and generate jobs . 
And they need to have enough flexibility to respond quickly to short-term shocks . 
This comes down to structural reforms that spur competition , reduce unnecessary red tape , and make labor markets more adaptable . 
Until now , whether or not to carry out such reforms has largely been a national prerogative . 
But in a union such as ours they are a clear common interest . 
Euro area countries depend on one another for growth . 
And , more fundamentally , if a lack of structural reforms leads to permanent divergence within the monetary union , this raises the specter of exit - from which all members ultimately suffer . 
In the euro area , stability and prosperity anywhere depend on countries thriving everywhere . 
So there is a strong case for sharing more sovereignty in this area - for building a genuine economic union . 
This means more than beefing up existing procedures . 
It means governing together : shifting from coordination to common decision-making , and from rules to institutions . 
The second implication of the absence of fiscal transfers is that countries need to invest more in other mechanisms to share the cost of shocks . 
Even with more flexible economies , internal adjustment will always be slower than it would be if countries had their own exchange rate . 
Risk-sharing is thus essential to prevent recessions from leaving permanent scars and reinforcing economic divergence . 
A key part of the solution is to improve private risk-sharing by deepening financial integration . 
Indeed , the less public risk-sharing we want , the more private risk-sharing we need . 
A banking union for the euro area should be catalytic in encouraging deeper integration of the banking sector . 
But risk-sharing is also about deepening capital markets , especially for equity , which is why we also need to advance quickly with a capital markets union . 
Still , we have to acknowledge the vital role of fiscal policies in a monetary union . 
A single monetary policy focused on price stability in the euro area cannot react to shocks that affect only one country or region . 
So , to avoid prolonged local slumps , it is critical that national fiscal policies can perform their stabilization role . 
To allow national fiscal stabilizers to work , governments must be able to borrow at an affordable cost in times of economic stress . 
A strong fiscal framework is indispensable to achieve this , and protects countries from contagion . 
But the crisis experience suggests that , in times of extreme market tensions , even a sound initial fiscal position may not offer absolute protection from spillovers . 
This is a further reason why we need economic union : markets would be less likely to react negatively to temporarily higher deficits if they were more confident in future growth prospects . 
By committing governments to structural reforms , economic union provides the credibility that countries can indeed grow out of debt . 
Ultimately , economic convergence among countries cannot be only an entry criterion for monetary union , or a condition that is met some of the time . 
It has to be a condition that is fulfilled all of the time . 
And for this reason , to complete monetary union we will ultimately have to deepen our political union further : to lay down its rights and obligations in a renewed institutional order .
