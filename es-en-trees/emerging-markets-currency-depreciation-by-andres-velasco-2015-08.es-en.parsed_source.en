The Emerging-Market Currency Rout 
SANTIAGO - With the currencies of Malaysia , Indonesia , South Africa , Turkey , Brazil , Colombia , Chile , and Mexico hitting record lows recently , currency traders around the world are asking : How much further can emerging-market currencies weaken ? 
The standard approach to answering this question takes a relatively normal base year and measures how much a country &apos;s currency has depreciated since then . 
That number is then adjusted for the inflation differential between the country and its trading partners . 
If the resulting real exchange rate is not too far from that of the base year , the market is said to be in equilibrium , and little or no further depreciation should be expected . 
Now consider an alternative method . 
Take the same country &apos;s current-account deficit and ask how large a real depreciation is needed ( making some assumptions about trade elasticities along the way ) to close that external gap . 
If the recent real depreciation achieves that threshold , no further change in the exchange rate should be expected . 
These are the right answers , but to the wrong question . 
Over the medium to long term , exchange rates are indeed driven by what happens in the real economy . 
Or , more precisely , they reflect the requirement that the real exchange rate be such that the economy attains both external balance ( a small and manageable current-account deficit ) and internal balance ( no inflationary pressures at home ) . 
But that need not happen until many months - perhaps years - after a shock . 
In the short run , exchange rates are driven by purely financial considerations . 
Even small changes in fundamentals can have large effects on exchange rates , with up-front movements that far exceed what long-run adjustment requires . 
And the potential for volatility is particularly great if domestic corporations have large foreign-currency debts , which is true in all of the emerging economies under stress today . 
Consider the case of a hypothetical Latin American retail company that borrowed abroad in dollars to build a shopping mall at home . 
Such borrowing calls for collateral - in this case , the land on which construction will take place . 
The larger the value of the collateral , typically measured in domestic currency ( or in an inflation-indexed unit , such as Chile &apos;s Unidad de Fomento ) , the larger the size of the dollar loan . 
Next , suppose that the price of the natural resource that is the country &apos;s largest export suddenly dips sharply ( as has happened recently ) . 
The exchange rate ( both nominal and real ) will depreciate accordingly , thereby setting in motion the standard , textbook adjustment process . 
But in this case , a second , non-standard factor comes into play . 
After the depreciation , the collateral , valued in dollars , is worth less . 
Loan covenants have likely been broken , and lenders begin demanding that the borrower either put up new collateral or deleverage and repay part of the loan . 
To repay , the firm must purchase dollars . 
If there are large dollar debts outstanding , and many firms find themselves in the same position , the additional demand for dollars will cause the exchange rate to depreciate even further . 
And that , of course , causes the dollar value of the collateral to fall yet again . 
You can see where this story is going . 
The process plays out until the domestic currency has lost a good deal of its value . 
After a few days or weeks , the exchange rate is likely to be weaker than is warranted by the need to adjust the current account . 
The overshooting is caused by the coexistence of sizeable foreign-currency debts and financial ( collateral ) constraints . 
Notice that if in the long run the debt is reduced sufficiently , and the terms-of-trade shock abates somewhat , the real exchange rate need not depreciate that much , and may even end up appreciating a bit . 
This is overshooting on steroids : a very sharp initial loss of value for the domestic currency , followed by a gain that may leave the exchange rate , measured in inflation-adjusted terms , stronger than it was at the start . 
For many emerging-market economies , this is , alas , a painfully realistic scenario . 
Since the subprime crisis , ultra-low interest rates in the rich world have caused emerging-market firms to borrow like never before . 
Some of the debt does not even appear in the official statistics of borrowing countries , because it was often taken on not by domestically-based firms , but by their offshore subsidiaries . 
The Bank for International Settlements estimates outstanding dollar credit to non-bank borrowers outside the United States at $ 9 trillion . 
Big debtors include some of those countries whose currencies have come under downward pressure recently : China ( $ 1 trillion ) , Brazil ( more than $ 300 billion ) , India ( $ 125 billion ) , plus Malaysia , South Africa , Turkey , and Latin America &apos;s financially open economies : Colombia , Chile , Peru , and Mexico . 
Central banks can intervene in the currency markets and sell reserves , thereby offsetting the withdrawal of financing by foreign lenders . 
But intervention requires that the authorities first have both the reserves and the will to abandon ( at least temporarily ) their hands-off commitment to a floating exchange rate . 
Not all emerging-market central banks are in a position to fulfill both of these requirements . 
A sharp growth slowdown is the other component of this overshooting adjustment pattern . 
The initial export shock was likely to reduce growth . 
The sudden deleveraging imposed by foreign creditors requires the current-account balance to adjust further and faster . 
The additional exports triggered by the depreciated currency can help , but they are often slow in coming . 
The fastest way to adjust is via reduced demand and imports , and that is what almost always ends up happening . 
Growth and job creation take the hit , as we are seeing today in emerging market economies around the world . 
In these circumstances , currency traders suffer . 
But citizens of indebted middle-income countries are likely to suffer far more . 
Today &apos;s emerging-market turmoil is here to stay , and they are the true victims .
