Defying the Garden of Eden Syndrome 
ACCRA - When you fly into Takoradi , Ghana &apos;s fourth largest city and an industrial and commercial center , one of the first things you notice are the oil rigs along the coast . 
Nearby , in the city of Elmina , one can see the scars of the past . 
An eerie feeling clings to you even after you finish the tour of the dungeons of the notorious Elmina Castle , the nerve center of the former West African slave trade . 
In Ghana last month , I met ministers who shared with me impressive figures on how much progress the country has made in achieving the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) . 
Some traditional leaders , academics , representatives of civil-society groups , and students , on the other hand , were more worried about whether the country &apos;s new oil wealth would benefit ordinary people . 
Is oil a blessing or a curse ? 
Will oil and other natural resources force Ghana , ranked among the leading producers of cocoa , coffee , and oil palm , to turn its back on agriculture ? 
Will oil wealth create a kleptocracy on the bones of 30 years of progress in meeting standard criteria of good governance ? 
Ghanaians are not alone in voicing such concerns . 
Their compatriots in Sierra Leone also want to know what will happen now that they , too , have won the commodities lottery : last year , the country struck oil and discovered one of the largest iron-ore deposits in the world . 
It also recently signed new mining concessions for bauxite , in addition to existing concessions for diamonds , titanium , and gold . 
One of the iron-ore concessions in Sierra Leone is estimated to hold 10.5 billion tons of ore . 
Similar stories of mineral abundance have emerged in other African countries in recent years , including in Chad , Guinea , Liberia , Mauritania , and Sudan . 
And , as the rest of the world grapples with austerity measures , such countries should be considering restoration strategies and ways to permanently wean themselves off foreign aid . 
In the same way that Ghana was the trailblazer for ending colonial rule , it could also become sub-Saharan Africa &apos;s next success story in economic terms . 
But it must be ready to make some tough choices - and study the region &apos;s existing success stories . 
On a continent where mineral wealth too often has become a curse , Botswana , under the leadership of President Festus Gontebanye Mogae , has demonstrated how natural resources can promote sustainable development and good governance . 
Mogae managed to hold down inflation and attract foreign investment in order to diversify Botswana &apos;s economy and make it less dependent on the extraction of diamonds , while simultaneously ensuring that more of the country &apos;s mineral wealth was processed at home . 
Thanks in part to the efforts of celebrities like Bono and Bob Geldof , some African countries were absolved of their long-standing debt a few years ago . 
The choices that we as Africans make today will determine whether we remain poor , evolve into Dubai-like diversified economies , or follow the successful agriculture-led industrialization model implemented in Malaysia ( despite that country &apos;s gas discoveries ) . 
African countries could also choose the Norwegian model , which established the principles that natural wealth belongs to all citizens , including the unborn , and that all mining deals should be completely transparent to the public . 
Adherence to these principles ensures that private rent-seeking and appropriation of oil profits , a major dimension of the so-called resource curse , is avoided . 
At the same time , it is important to prevent mineral wealth from causing unwarranted currency appreciation - the dreaded &quot; Dutch disease . &quot; 
In The Africans : Triple Heritage , the Kenyan-born scholar Ali Mazrui expressed concern about what he perceived to be a Garden of Eden in decay . 
Speaking of the lost decade of the 1980 &quot; s in Africa , Mazrui observed that , despite being endowed with superb climatic conditions , few African countries could feed themselves ; likewise , despite being engaged in trade in minerals and cash crops , most countries still wallowed in a state of aid-dependency . 
Mazrui , forever the optimist , expressed hope that the &quot; human will has the power of restoration . &quot; 
We Africans can blame colonialism for most of the problems of the past 350 years , but we will have no one to blame for the decisions that we make in the next 50 years . 
No one is forcing us to sign the mining and drilling deals today . 
African leaders should use the Natural Resource Charter , launched in Oslo in 2009 , and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative as guidelines when undertaking any mining negotiations . 
We can and must avoid the Garden of Eden Syndrome .
