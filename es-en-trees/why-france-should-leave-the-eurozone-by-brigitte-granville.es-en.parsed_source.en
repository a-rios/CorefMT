The French Disconnection 
PARIS - Dire conditions can permit what was once unthinkable to push its way into public debate . 
In France , the idea that now dares to speak its name is that the country will sink into an ever-deeper economic malaise unless it regains its monetary sovereignty . 
Two striking statements on economic policy by France &apos;s leaders in the first weeks of this year have highlighted the force of this logic . 
First , President François Hollande , worried about the euro &apos;s appreciation against other major world currencies , called for an exchange-rate target . 
Then , Pierre Moscovici , the finance minister , said that Europe might grant France a delay in meeting the 3 % -of-GDP budget-deficit target mandated from this year onward under the eurozone &apos;s newly ratified fiscal compact . 
These positions imply a desire to exercise sovereign power over the Economic and Monetary Union &apos;s rules and decisions . 
Back in 1989-1991 , exactly the same motive underlay President François Mitterrand &apos;s imposition of the euro on Germany - that is , to harness the Bundesbank &apos;s monetary power to a framework in which France could be confident of wielding decisive influence . 
Since the single currency was France &apos;s condition for accepting German reunification , Germany played along . 
Two decades later , Germany may be in a different mood . 
The sovereign-debt-and-banking crisis that has roiled the monetary union since 2010 has steadily exposed the realities at play here , as irrevocably fixed exchange rates lock in and deepen differences in eurozone members &quot; competitiveness . 
In France &apos;s case , the loss of competitiveness and resulting sharp decline in export performance has been aggravated by relying on crushing taxation of labor to finance generous welfare programs and top-drawer public services ( a practice exacerbated by stifling labor-market regulation ) . 
In a monetary union , there are only two ways to close a competitiveness gap between countries : transfers from the more competitive to the less competitive , or internal devaluation , which means real wage cuts . 
Not surprisingly , the preference has been for transfers , which , until the 2008 financial crash , took the form of cross-border private-sector lending to governments and banks . 
Following the credit-bubble burst in 2008 , fiscal transfers replaced these private financial flows , causing budget deficits to balloon . 
And now , with the German government , as chief creditor , calling the shots on cross-border transfers to weaker eurozone countries , all such transfers are conditional on austerity ( that is , internal devaluation ) . 
Bailouts from the European Stability Mechanism represent the clearest example of this , with the fiscal compact now committing signatories to tight deficit targets and structural adjustment . 
And more austerity is a vital , if less well remarked on , condition of the European Central Bank &apos;s declared willingness to buy unlimited quantities of troubled countries &quot; short-term government debt . 
So far , the &quot; bazooka &quot; represented by the ECB &apos;s &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; program has had the desired effect - without having to be used . 
Eurozone financial markets have stabilized , and the euro has appreciated against the dollar and the yen . 
But , as Hollande &apos;s recent declarations indicate , currency appreciation is the last thing that an uncompetitive country like France needs . 
Although the French government , unlike its Spanish and Italian counterparts , has not yet had any difficulty financing itself at low interest rates , currency appreciation as the economy slides into recession is like fuel poured onto an unlit bonfire . 
Unless growth is restored , France &apos;s already large public debt will expand unsustainably , heightening the risk that investors will shun French government bonds . 
From this predicament stems the fashionable idea that the bond market would actually welcome less fiscal austerity , because this would boost economic growth , in turn making the level of public debt appear more sustainable in the long run . 
It is no surprise that Moscovici is beginning to push for a &quot; collective European decision &quot; to relax the fiscal treaty &apos;s terms , given that French compliance would require massive new spending cuts . 
Will Germany agree to such a relaxation - or , for that matter , to Hollande &apos;s implicit demand that the ECB follow Japan &apos;s example and loosen monetary policy to drive the exchange rate back down ? 
Unlike Japan ( and , of course , the United States ) , France , as a member of a monetary union , cannot pursue domestic goals unilaterally . 
To avoid disaster , France has only two options : somehow force a change in German policy or go it alone . 
There are two reasons why , until now , the second option - leaving the monetary union - has been unthinkable . 
The first has to do with economic and financial risks . 
Ditching the euro might trigger a banking crisis , capital flight , inflation , and perhaps even sovereign default . 
On the other hand , higher competitiveness and erosion of the real value of debt would quickly outweigh these costs by restoring confidence in the French economy &apos;s prospects . 
This strategy &apos;s success , starting with the speed of restored access to external financing , would depend on the credibility of government policies - monetary , fiscal , and , above all , the radical and indispensable supply-side reforms for which there would now be breathing space . 
The specter of continuing economic stagnation and ever-rising unemployment ( with the young and older workers being the worst hit ) should remove the second , geopolitical obstacle to a French exit from the eurozone . 
For French elites since World War II , alignment with Germany has been central to projecting French power and influence . 
Such ambitions must now be sacrificed for the sake of the French public &apos;s well-being . 
France will not regain its economic strength without setting aside the euro . 
Even during that adjustment , there is no reason why relations with European partners should suffer in any fundamental sense . 
On the contrary , the sustainable prosperity that would result from that adjustment would create a much healthier long-term foundation for continuing the quest for an &quot; ever closer union &quot; in Europe .
