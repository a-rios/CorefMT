A Responsibility to Protect Iraqis ? 
CANBERRA - Only one possible justification - moral , political , or military - exists for renewed Western or other external military intervention in Iraq : meeting the international responsibility to protect victims , or potential victims , of mass atrocity crimes - genocide , ethnic cleansing , other crimes against humanity , or major war crimes . 
Shia and other non-Sunnis in the path of the marauding ISIS ( Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ) - a group whose ideology and behavior are too extreme even for Al Qaeda to stomach - have plenty of reason to fear such atrocities . 
Ugly executions of military and other captives have undoubtedly occurred in Mosul , Tikrit , and other cities seized by ISIS . 
But , based on the evidence currently available , it would be premature to conclude that violence against the defenseless has already occurred - or is imminent - on the scale necessary to justify outside military intervention . 
Though pundits have been wrong about almost everything so far in this round of violence , the best current assessment of the overall military situation is that the acute phase of the crisis is past . 
The mobilization of Shia militias means that the nightmare scenario , the fall of Baghdad , is unlikely , despite the virtual collapse of the Iraqi army . 
According to this view , a protracted civil war can be expected , with the most probable long-term outcome being a permanent partition along ethno-sectarian fault lines . 
It is difficult to make a case for military intervention to prop up the current government and try to enable it to re-establish authority over the entire country . 
Nouri al-Maliki , the Shia prime minister , has been brutal , corrupt , and outrageously sectarian - deeply embarrassing his supporters in the United States and sometimes even his patrons in Iran . 
Taking his side in an inter-communal civil war , even if it aided the much-needed US rapprochement with Iran , would simply add fuel to the Middle East cauldron . 
Things might be different if al-Maliki could be persuaded to step down in favor of a broad-based Shia-Sunni-Kurdish administration , determined to govern inclusively and create an effective , non-political national army . 
Massive diplomatic effort certainly should be mobilized to achieve this goal . 
But this project has failed in the past , and the domestic leadership needed to ensure its success is nowhere to be seen . 
Even if such an optimal political outcome were achieved , it is difficult to see what value could be added by external military intervention intended to destroy ISIS as a militant Sunni force . 
Maybe the limited advisory and technical support now on offer from the US would be of some use . 
But , beyond that , air strikes require targets - elusive when no armies are on the move - and all too often they produce innocent civilian casualties . 
And even 150,000 pairs of foreign boots on the ground were insufficient to stabilize the country after the horribly ill-judged US-led military intervention in 2003 . 
None of this means that an external military option should be ruled out in the event of mass atrocity crimes occurring - or being imminently feared - at the hands of ISIS or anyone else . 
In 2005 , 150 heads of state and government at the United Nations unanimously supported an international responsibility to protect ( &quot; R2P &quot; ) at-risk populations , which in extreme cases could take the form of Security Council-authorized military intervention , as happened in 2011 in response to the behavior of Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s regime in Libya . 
Disagreement about the use of that mandate to pursue regime change , rather than only protection of civilians , paralyzed the Security Council in the face of similar atrocities in Syria . 
But international support for basic R2P principles remains strong , with the Council itself continuing to use &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; terminology in its resolutions and statements ( 26 times , at last count , since Libya ) . 
It is not impossible to envisage a consensus re-emerging should a sufficiently horrifying new atrocity occur in Iraq . 
Of course , no such intervention will , or should , be approved in practice unless it is seen as satisfying several moral or prudential criteria , which , though not yet adopted by the UN as formal benchmarks , have been the subject of much international debate and acceptance over the last decade . 
Those criteria are that the atrocities occurring or feared are sufficiently serious to justify , prima facie , a military response ; that the response has a primarily humanitarian motive ; that no lesser response is likely to be effective in halting or averting the harm ; that the proposed response is proportional to the threat ; and that the intervention will actually be effective , doing more good than harm . 
These criteria , particularly the last , will always be difficult to satisfy . 
But , should an obvious case for action arise in Iraq , we should not be so consumed by the desire not to repeat the misguided intervention in 2003 , that we fail - as we did in Cambodia , Rwanda , Bosnia , and so often elsewhere - to respond as our common humanity demands .
