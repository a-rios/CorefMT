New Tremors in Global Finance and Trade 
PALO ALTO - With the American and global economies in the early stages of post-recession recovery , serious questions remain about that recovery &apos;s strength and sustainability . 
In addition to traditional business-cycle concerns , there is a long list of policy tensions threatening to curb growth , including : 1 ) protectionism ; 2 ) currencies ; 3 ) monetary- and fiscal-stimulus exit strategies ; and 4 ) the explosion of public debt . 
Recovery from deep recessions is usually strong - the American economy recovered from the two other deep post-World War II recessions with annual real growth over 6 % for three years . 
But nobody forecasts strong growth like that now , because recoveries from financial crises are usually slow and painful . 
It is worth remembering the real dimensions of the 1930 &quot; s Great Depression , with which politicians compare this recession to justify massive government intervention . 
From 1929 to 1933 , real GDP in the United States fell 30 % , and the unemployment rate reached almost 25 % , while the depression itself lasted more than a decade - all large multiples of the recent decline , and of the somewhat larger decline that the intervention helped to avert . 
Policy mistakes ranging from tax hikes to poor central-bank decisions to a global wave of protectionism ( most famously America &apos;s Smoot-Hawley tariff ) turned a deep recession into the Great Depression . 
We should not repeat those mistakes now . 
While global leaders expand IMF resources and attempt to coordinate international financial regulation , trade and currency tensions are growing . 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao chastise American protectionism . 
Meanwhile , there has been virtually no progress in restarting the Doha round of global trade reforms . 
When progress is not being made , non-tariff barriers grow like weeds in response to domestic interests . 
Tensions are rising over currencies as well . 
Given the expansion of the US Federal Reserve &apos;s balance sheet , its purchase of long-term Treasuries , the Fed &apos;s historical record of being late and slow in raising interest rates , and the explosion of US public debt , there is fear of an eventual monetization of the US debt and future inflation . 
Today , there is little short-run inflation risk in the advanced economies ; core inflation will decline , both in the euro zone and in America , and Japan &apos;s problem will be deflation . But inflation is a risk in some emerging economies , including India and China , whose central bank governor , Zhou Xiaochuan , suggests considering a basket of currencies to replace the dollar as the global reserve currency . 
Conversely , US President Barack Obama promises to &quot; get tough on China &apos;s currency , &quot; and America &apos;s Congress is considering a move to force the US Treasury to label China a currency manipulator , paving the way for retaliatory tariffs . 
But China &apos;s trade surplus with the US is not primarily due to undervaluing its currency . 
The tremendous growth in global current-account imbalances magnified problems that led to the financial crisis . 
Indeed , the surplus in developing Asia , Japan , and the Middle East soared from less than $ 200 billion in 2001 to more than $ 1 trillion in 2008 , while the deficit of the US and the European Union rose from $ 425 billion to more than $ 900 billion . 
So the last thing the global economy needs now is a trade war . 
Not only has the euro gyrated recently , but some now question its long-term viability . 
On balance , the euro has been a success , but it does balance gains from price transparency and decreased transaction costs against the loss of independent monetary policies and a currency adjustment shock absorber . 
With no separate currencies to adjust , the only shock absorber left is labor migration to areas with lower unemployment - for example , from southern to northern Europe . 
Such migration is easier in the US than within the euro-zone or even within European countries . 
Thus , countries on the EU &apos;s periphery - Portugal , Italy , Greece , and Spain - with large public debt and current-account deficits , face lower real wages and high unemployment for some time . 
The greatest systemic risk to the global economy , far greater than that associated with any financial institution , is the explosion of public debt . 
The IMF forecasts the debt-to-GDP ratio in the US to rise to 85 % by 2014 ( prompting the rating agency Moody &apos;s to threaten a downgrade in America &apos;s bond ratings ) , and to 82 % in Germany , 85 % in France , 126 % in Italy , and 144 % in Japan . 
As recovery continues , this public-sector debt will increasingly crowd out private-sector , local-government and developing-country borrowing . 
Uncertainty over the resolution of the debt is likely to provoke political instability over tax hikes and spending cuts , and therefore volatility in financial markets . 
Worse still , high levels of public debt , like high taxes , cause serious problems for economic performance . 
The IMF estimates that every increase of ten percentage points in the debt-to-GDP ratio reduces long-term growth by a quarter of a percentage point . 
In other words , the projected increase in debt ratios could slow long-term annual growth by 0.6 percentage points in the euro zone , almost one percentage point in the US , more than one percentage point in the United Kingdom , and 1.3 percentage points in Japan . 
Cutting growth rates by 40-70 % is surely a recipe for stagnant societies with insufficient growth to satisfy private wants and public needs . 
Moreover , such a slowdown would devastate the developing world , as weaker performance in the advanced economies reduces the growth of export markets . 
These tremors in the international financial system are serious and must be contained . 
A long period of sluggish growth as a result of bloated government debt would be the equivalent of an extended bout with cancer after the heart attack that our economies have just survived . Prevention begins by curbing trade friction and developing sensible post-crisis monetary and fiscal exit strategies , sooner rather than later .
