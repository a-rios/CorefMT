The IMF &apos;s New Direction 
WASHINGTON , DC - Roughly one year ago , the global economic situation looked grim : a severe global recession , sizeable wealth destruction , and declines in trade and employment . 
Continued cooperation , one hopes , will be the legacy of this crisis . 
The global economy is now on a recovery path , albeit uneven , and financial conditions have improved substantially . 
Clouds of uncertainty linger , however , and there is much unfinished business . 
Indeed , the work needed to build a more robust , stable , and safe global financial system has only just begun . 
Moreover , the recovery is not global , unemployment is still rising in most countries , global savings imbalances have not been addressed , and conditions in the worlds &quot; poorest states remain vulnerable . 
These issues have broad implications for global stability and peace . 
Remember , economic stability lays the groundwork for peace , while peace is a necessary precondition for trade and sustained economic growth . 
In the annals of economic crises then , where do we find ourselves ? 
In policy terms , we are at a critical point where fundamental changes to the system can be made , in part because our collective memory is sufficiently fresh to supply the necessary political will . 
We must not waste this opportunity . 
What needs to be done ? 
Global economic governance , including at the IMF , must be reformed to reflect the realities of the current era , and global financial-sector supervision and regulation need to be strengthened . 
Progress is well underway in both areas , but we must maintain the momentum into 2010 and beyond . 
This year , leaders have moved decisively to make the G-20 the main forum for international economic cooperation ; tripled the IMF &apos;s resources ; agreed to shift some of the Fund &apos;s quota share to under-represented emerging and developing countries ; and committed to submitting their economic policy frameworks to &quot; mutual assessment , &quot; with the IMF &apos;s help . 
Recognizing that countries can no longer expect to achieve their economic goals in isolation , this peer review aims to incorporate systematically the goal of collective global welfare into national policy planning . 
More specifically , what are the governance priorities for policymakers in 2010 ? 
This past autumn , IMF members endorsed the G-20 &quot; s proposals , and asked the Fund to address four key reform areas - the so called &quot; Istanbul Decisions &quot; - in 2010 : the IMF &apos;s mandate , the Fund &apos;s financing role , governance , and multilateral surveillance . 
First , we will re-assess the Fund &apos;s original mandate - as set out in the IMF &apos;s Articles , and as practiced in recent years - in light of the range of economic and financial-sector policies that currently affect global stability . 
While the broad goals of promoting global financial stability and sustainable growth remain relevant , the surge in international capital flows , financial sector linkages , cross-border asset holdings , and the nature of this crisis all underscore the need to review the mandate and how we execute it . 
Second , following from the mandate question , we need to work closely with members to determine the optimal financing role of the IMF . 
Many countries have built up large official foreign-exchange reserves , in part as greater self-insurance against adverse external developments . 
Self-insurance , however , complicates domestic monetary and exchange-rate management , represents a misallocation of capital domestically and globally , and raises the risk of bigger financial crises down the road . 
As part of an overhaul of the Fund &apos;s lending facilities , we introduced the Flexible Credit Line ( FCL ) , a pre-emptive insurance facility for members with strong policies . 
While three countries ( Mexico , Poland , and Colombia ) have used this facility , innovation on a greater scale is probably needed . 
Third , in Istanbul , the IMF &apos;s governing body endorsed the big step forward on governance agreed by the G-20 : a shift in quota shares of at least 5 % ( by January 2011 ) from over-represented countries toward dynamic but under-represented emerging markets and developing countries . 
This change will mark a much-needed step toward making the Fund more democratic , giving members a more credible stake in its management , strategic operations , and aspirations . 
Greater legitimacy , in turn , will make the IMF more effective in promoting economic growth and stability in all of our member states . 
Members must push ahead to ratify the 2008 quota increase , and to move forward the 2010 quota review . 
Fourth , the IMF &apos;s governing body endorsed the G-20 proposal for the Fund to help with their peer review . 
The IMF has considerable experience with cooperative , peer reviews of members &quot; policy frameworks . 
But its advice has not always brought about concrete policy action by members . 
With the quota change noted above and the new G-20 &quot; mutual assessment , &quot; the traction of surveillance should become significantly deeper . 
Policymakers need to follow through on their commitment to the peer review process . 
The IMF is working with the Financial Stability Board and other organizations to develop new principles and guidelines , including on capital , liquidity , leverage , interconnectedness , systemically important institutions , the &quot; perimeter &quot; of regulation , and the pro-cyclical nature of rules . 
The challenge in this field will be to guard against complacency , while not overburdening the system with excessive regulation . 
Policymakers have a big agenda ahead , but they have already made an impressive start . 
As long as they continue working together to address common challenges in a cooperative spirit , the prospects for success look good .
