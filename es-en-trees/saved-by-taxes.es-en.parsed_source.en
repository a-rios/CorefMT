Saved by Taxes 
What do we owe to our great-great-great-grandchildren ? 
What actions are we obligated to take now in order to diminish the risks to our descendants and our planet from the increasing likelihood of global warming and climate change ? 
Almost everyone - except the likes of ExxonMobil , US Vice President Dick Cheney , and their paid servants and deluded acolytes - understands that when humans burn hydrocarbons , carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere , where it acts like a giant blanket , absorbing infrared radiation coming up from below and warming the earth . 
Likewise , almost everyone understands that while global warming might be a much smaller or larger problem than existing models suggest , this uncertainty is no excuse for inaction . 
In fact , uncertainty about global climate change should lead us to do more to guard against it than if we knew it would proceed exactly according to the central-case projections . 
Finally , almost everyone agrees that governments , non-profit institutions , and energy companies should be spending far more to develop technologies that generate non-carbon-emitting power , that remove it from the atmosphere to forests or oceans , and that cool the earth by reflecting more of the sunlight that lands on it . 
Clearly , the world &apos;s rich countries should carry the burden of dealing with climate change over the next generations . 
After all , they could take an easy , emissions-intensive path to industrialization and wealth . 
Today , China , India , and other developing countries cannot , and it would be unfair to penalize them for that . 
So now is the time to build , not disrupt or impede , the international institutions that will manage our response to global climate change in the years ahead . 
But should we be doing anything else now and in the next decade ? 
Economists like to think of things in terms of prices . 
And when economists see behavior that has destructive side effects , we like to tax it . 
Taxation makes individuals feel in their wallets the destruction they are causing . 
Imposing a tax on those who , say , drive low-mileage SUV &apos;s is a way of harnessing humanity &apos;s collective intelligence to decide when bad side effects are a reason to alter behavior . 
But it has to be the right tax . 
An SUV going ten miles in the city and burning a gallon of gasoline pumps about three kilograms of carbon into the atmosphere . 
Should the extra &quot; global warming &quot; tax be $ 0.05 a gallon , $ 0.50 a gallon , or $ 1.50 a gallon ? 
Our views will change as we learn more , but at the moment the size of the tax hinges on a question of moral philosophy : how much do we believe we owe our distant descendents ? 
The Australian economist John Quiggin has an illuminating discussion on his website ( http : / / johnquiggin.com ) that comes down on the side of a $ 0.50 / gallon tax , because he projects that spending today to reduce carbon emissions is a good investment for the future . 
Assuming that annual per capita income grows at about 2 % per year worldwide , a marginal expenditure of roughly $ 70 today to cut carbon emissions would be worth it if , accounting for damage from global warming and adjustment costs , the world of 2100 would be $ 500 richer in year-2006 purchasing power . 
On the other hand , critics point out that the world today is poor : average annual GDP per capita at purchasing power parity is roughly $ 7,000 . 
We expect improved technology and its spread to make the world of 2100 , at a 2 % annual growth rate , much richer : $ 50,000 per capita of year-2006 purchasing power . 
So the critics argue that we need the marginal $ 70 per capita today much more than the richer people of 2100 will need the $ 500 that they would gain from being spared the effects of global climate change . 
But what the critics often don &apos;t say is that the same logic applies to the world today . 
Average annual per capita incomes in the US , Japan , and Western Europe are currently around $ 40,000 , and less than $ 6,000 for the poorer half of the world &apos;s population . 
The same logic that says we need our $ 70 more than the people of 2100 need an extra $ 500 dictates that we should tax the world &apos;s rich more , as long as each extra $ 500 in first-world taxes generates as little as an extra $ 70 in poor countries per capita incomes . 
In short , if the world &apos;s rich are stingy today toward our much richer descendants , and if we want to leave our environmental mess to them to deal with , we should be lavish toward the world &apos;s poor . 
Likewise , if we are stingy today toward the world &apos;s poor , we should be lavish toward our descendents . 
At least , that is what we should do , if our actions are based on some moral principle , rather than that of Leonid Brezhnev : what we have , we hold .
