Puerto Rico in Crisis 
WASHINGTON , DC - Puerto Rico ought to be the jewel of the Caribbean . 
It is not . 
European firms doing business in North and South America locate their corporate headquarters in Miami , Panama City , and elsewhere , with almost none choosing Puerto Rico . 
And now the island &apos;s economy , after a decade of torpor , is declining at an accelerating rate as people leave for the US mainland . 
Public debt has soared , and the government says it cannot pay . 
Unlike Greece , Puerto Rico is not a country ( which means that it is not eligible for financing from the International Monetary Fund ) . 
Yet it has features of both : Although it has its own constitution , it is a United States territory , Puerto Ricans are US citizens , and the island is subject to US federal law , except as otherwise stipulated . 
The advantages of this hybrid status include the security and predictability of America &apos;s rule of law , eligibility for federal transfer payments , and favorable tax treatment . 
Puerto Ricans who are not US government employees do not pay federal income tax , and the island &apos;s bonds are &quot; triple tax-exempt &quot; ( free of federal , state , and local taxes ) . 
But there are also disadvantages to this arrangement . 
For example , Puerto Rico is subject to the Jones Act , which requires using very costly US-built ships and crews for all sea transport to and from the mainland . 
The island must also comply with the federally mandated minimum wage , despite an income level about half that of the poorest US state . 
And municipalities cannot benefit from Chapter 9 of the US bankruptcy code . 
Puerto Rico &apos;s current troubles trace their origin to the gradual withdrawal , starting in 1996 , of earlier exemptions from US corporate taxes for companies located on the island . 
Capital-intensive companies , especially pharmaceutical firms , began leaving . 
Puerto Rico &apos;s economy recorded little growth after 1996 , and real ( inflation-adjusted ) GDP has been falling for the past decade . 
Many Puerto Ricans , unable to find jobs on the island , have migrated to the mainland , with the population and labor force estimated to be shrinking at a rate of 1.5 % this year . 
Moreover , Puerto Rico &apos;s labor force participation rate is under 40 % , compared to 62 % on the mainland . 
There is plenty of blame to go around for these failures . 
Successive Puerto Rican governments thought that the island &apos;s economy was in &quot; recession &quot; and attempted to spur activity by increasing government spending . 
Low interest rates meant that deficits could be financed by floating bonds . 
Debt mounted , and markets are now almost entirely closed to more . 
Despite efforts to cut expenditures and boost tax receipts , current and prospective obligations ( including pension liabilities ) far exceed any feasible increase in government revenues . 
Given the ease with which Puerto Ricans move to the mainland , raising taxes is unlikely to increase revenues . 
The US government also is culpable . 
The inapplicability of Chapter 9 makes orderly debt restructuring very difficult . 
Moreover , Puerto Rico is covered by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and must pay accordingly , even though the island &apos;s doctors are compensated at a lower rate than those on the mainland ( and the Puerto Rican government must bear much of the cost ) . 
The same is true of some other welfare payments . 
Low labor force participation is a result of the relatively low productivity of Puerto Rico &apos;s unskilled workers . 
Companies cannot compete with firms that pay much lower wage rates on neighboring islands . 
A rule of thumb is that a minimum wage that is above 55 % of the median wage will impede job creation ( and economic growth ) ; 
Puerto Rico &apos;s minimum wage is 77 % of the median , owing to the federal mandate . 
A family of three with one wage earner at the minimum wage can take home about $ 1,100 per month , while it could get about $ 1,700 on welfare . 
No surprise , then , that people either leave the island or go on welfare and work in the informal economy . 
Overcoming Puerto Rico &apos;s crisis will require restoring growth , implementing a sustainable fiscal policy , and debt restructuring . 
Accomplishing the first of these would , together with reduction of excessive government expenditures , help to achieve the second . 
For the Puerto Rican authorities , this means making the island friendlier to business , including by removing onerous labor-market regulations . 
Meanwhile , the US government could exempt Puerto Rico from the Jones Act , extend to it Chapter 9 bankruptcy coverage , and align the island &apos;s welfare and labor requirements with its productivity level . 
Each of these policy actions requires political will . 
Puerto Rico &apos;s governor , Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla , has appointed a working group to produce a five-year program to restore growth and fiscal sustainability . 
Bills to make Puerto Rico eligible for Chapter 9 are being introduced in Congress . 
These and other measures now under consideration promise to improve Puerto Rico &apos;s economic prospects . 
Puerto Rico is not Greece ; successive governors of the island have introduced budgets they thought were balanced , only to find that inadequate growth led to lower revenues and higher expenditures than had been projected . 
But it is a US territory .
