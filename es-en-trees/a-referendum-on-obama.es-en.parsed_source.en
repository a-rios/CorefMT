A Referendum on Obama 
STANFORD - Successful political candidates try to implement the proposals on which they ran . 
In the United States , President Barack Obama and the Democrats , controlling the House of Representatives and ( a filibuster-proof ) Senate , had the power to do virtually anything they wanted in 2009 - and so they did . 
Obama and his congressional allies enacted an $ 800 billion &quot; stimulus &quot; bill that was loaded with programs geared to key Democratic constituencies , such as environmentalists and public employees ; adopted a sweeping and highly unpopular health-care reform ( whose constitutionality will be determined by the Supreme Court this year ) ; imposed vast new regulations on wide swaths of the economy ; embraced an industrial policy that selects certain companies for special treatment ; engaged in borrowing and spending at levels exceeded only in World War II ; and centralized power in Washington , DC ( and , within the federal government , in the executive branch and regulatory agencies ) . 
The last election that was followed by such a sweeping change in policy direction occurred in 1980 , when President Ronald Reagan overhauled taxes , spending , and regulation , and supported the Federal Reserve &apos;s course of disinflation . 
While the 1988 , 1992 , and 2000 elections were also quite consequential , the policy shifts were not nearly as large as in 1980 and 2008 . 
The country rebelled against Obama and the Democrats &quot; lurch to the left with historic Congressional election victories for Republicans in 2010 . 
Since then , many Republicans have been deeply disappointed that the House of Representatives has been unable to roll back much of Obama &apos;s agenda . 
But the US political system is set up to make it much harder to accomplish something than to block it . 
It is not easy to do a lot while controlling only one-half of one-third of the federal government . 
The 2012 election is shaping up as a referendum on Obama &apos;s policies and performance . 
The economy is improving slowly , but it remains in bad shape , with high unemployment and millions having left the labor force . 
Republicans are expected to retain control of the House and regain a majority in the Senate . 
Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney , the Republican frontrunner to challenge Obama in November , and the party &apos;s other leading candidates , including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , want less spending , major reforms of government programs , lower taxes , trade expansion , and less and more-targeted regulation than does Obama . 
Romney , for example , has a detailed 59-point economic program , including a cap on federal spending at 20 % of GDP , which would require reductions similar to those in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . 
Gingrich and the other Republicans have an even more aggressive agenda of cutting taxes and reducing the size and scope of government . 
The eventual nominee would be wise to incorporate his opponents &quot; best ideas and top people into his campaign . 
A Republican presidential victory , together with Republican control of the House and Senate , would likely lead to substantial reduction , repeal , and replacement of many Obama initiatives , attempts to reform taxes and entitlements , and measures to impose greater fiscal discipline . 
High on Romney &apos;s agenda is a reduction of the corporate-tax rate , from 35 % to 25 % , the OECD average level ( the other Republican candidates would lower it still more ) , which would redress a major competitive disadvantage for American multinational companies &quot; global business . 
A Republican victory would also most likely lead to a major push to open up many more energy-exploration opportunities within America , which Obama has stymied . 
Romney has promised tougher negotiations on trade and currency with China , but is generally far more likely to push new trade agreements than the labor-supported Obama administration . 
If , however , Democrats retain control of the Senate , this will be far more difficult to accomplish . 
A Republican president also would make appointments to many key policymaking positions , from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to regulatory agencies . 
If Obama is re-elected , and Republicans control the House and Senate , his legislative agenda will essentially be a dead letter , and he will spend the next two years , at least , negotiating its reform and rollback . 
In this scenario , the policy center of gravity in the Republican party would shift to House Speaker John Boehner , the chairman of the House Budget Committee , Paul Ryan , House Majority Leader Eric Cantor , and other key Representatives , including David Camp , Kevin Brady , and Kevin McCarthy , along with several Senators . 
In that case , Obama would be wise to move to the center ( as Bill Clinton did after the Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994 ) and work with congressional Republicans to shape sensible tax and entitlement reforms . 
But that seems unlikely : since the Democrats &quot; massive defeat in 2010 , Obama has moved even further to the left , embracing a more populist agenda . 
Regardless of the outcome of this year &apos;s presidential and congressional elections , various Republican state governors are likely to gain a higher national profile . 
All of them - including Mitch Daniels of Indiana , Chris Christie of New Jersey , Bob McDonnell of Virginia , and former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida - declined to seek the Republican presidential nomination , but will be on the short list for 2016 should Obama win in November . 
Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis famously described the states as &quot; laboratories &quot; : they should be allowed to experiment and learn from each other which policies work . 
For example , Clinton and the Republican Congress based landmark 1996 welfare reform on policies originated by Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson and successfully emulated by New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani , both reformist Republicans . 
The current cohort of Republican governors offers similarly innovative state-level solutions - for example , on spending , debt , and unfunded pension and health liabilities - as models for the country . 
Until November , divided government and contentious campaigning will most likely prevent significant policy moves . 
But , following the election , taxes and spending , trade policy , federalism , regulation , and defense will take a different course - how different depends on who wins - with important implications for America &apos;s fiscal position , external balance , and much else , including its relations with the rest of the world .
