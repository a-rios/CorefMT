A Tale of Two American Economies 
NEW YORK - While the United States recently reported 3.5 % GDP growth in the third quarter , suggesting that the most severe recession since the Great Depression is over , the American economy is actually much weaker than official data suggest . 
Third quarter GDP - properly corrected for these factors - may have been 2 % rather than 3.5 % . 
The story of the US is , indeed , one of two economies . There is a smaller one that is slowly recovering and a larger one that is still in a deep and persistent downturn . 
Consider the following facts . 
While America &apos;s official unemployment rate is already 10.2 % , the figure jumps to a whopping 17.5 % when discouraged workers and partially employed workers are included . 
Moreover , the total effect on labor income - the product of jobs times hours worked times average hourly wages - has been more severe than that implied by the job losses alone , because many firms are cutting their workers &quot; hours , placing them on furlough , or lowering their wages as a way to share the pain . 
Many of the lost jobs - in construction , finance , and outsourced manufacturing and services - are gone forever , and recent studies suggest that a quarter of US jobs can be fully outsourced over time to other countries . 
Thus , a growing proportion of the workforce - often below the radar screen of official statistics - is losing hope of finding gainful employment , while the unemployment rate ( especially for poor , unskilled workers ) will remain high for a much longer period of time than in previous recessions . 
Consider also the credit markets . 
Prime borrowers with good credit scores and investment-grade firms are not experiencing a credit crunch at this point , as the former have access to mortgages and consumer credit while the latter have access to bond and equity markets . 
But non-prime borrowers - about one-third of US households - do not have much access to mortgages and credit cards . 
They live from paycheck to paycheck - often a shrinking paycheck , owing to the decline in hourly wages and hours worked . 
And the credit crunch for non-investment-grade firms and smaller firms , which rely mostly on access to bank loans rather than capital markets , is still severe . 
Or consider bankruptcies and defaults by households and firms . 
Larger firms - even those with large debt problems - can refinance their excessive liabilities in court or out of court ; but an unprecedented number of small businesses are going bankrupt . 
The same holds for households , with millions of weaker and poorer borrowers defaulting on mortgages , credit cards , auto loans , student loans , and other forms of consumer credit . 
Recent monthly figures suggest a pick-up in retail sales . 
But , because the official statistics capture mostly sales by larger retailers and exclude the fall in sales by hundreds of thousands of smaller stores and businesses that have failed , consumption looks better than it really is . 
And , while higher-income and wealthier households have a buffer of savings to smooth consumption and avoid having to increase savings , most lower-income households must save more , as banks and other lenders cut back on home-equity loans and lower limits on credit cards . 
As a result , the household savings rate has risen from zero to 4 % of disposable income . 
To be sure , the US government is increasing its budget deficits to put a floor under demand . 
Many state and local governments in poorer regions of the country are at risk of bankruptcy unless the federal government undertakes a massive bailout of their finances . 
Moreover , income and wealth inequality is rising again : poorer households are at greater risk of unemployment , falling wages , or reductions in hours worked , all leading to lower labor income , whereas on Wall Street outrageous bonuses have returned with a vengeance . 
With the stock market rising while home prices are still falling , the wealthy are becoming richer , while the middle class and the poor - whose main wealth is a home rather than equities - are becoming poorer and being saddled with an unsustainable debt burden . 
So , while the US may technically be close to the end of a severe recession , most of America is facing a near-depression . 
Little wonder , then , that few Americans believe that what walks like a duck and quacks like a duck is actually the phoenix of recovery .
