Are Bankers Really Overpaid ? 
LONDON - Are financial sector workers paid too much ? 
Not all of them are , of course , for there are poorly paid bank clerks and cleaners who count in this category . But is it possible to justify the enormous rewards earned - or should we say received - by investment bankers , hedge fund managers and private equity partners ? 
Most people would easily and quickly answer &quot; no . &quot; 
Certainly that is what Congressmen in the US , and Members of Parliament in the UK think . 
They are trying to cook up ways to discipline financial firms , albeit without conspicuous success so far , as demonstrated by the large sums stashed away for employee compensation by Goldman Sachs after its most recent profitable quarter . 
But what does it mean to say that financial folk are paid too much ? 
By what measure , and in relation to whom are they overpaid ? 
Like many other people , I tend to believe that anyone paid more than me is prima facie over-rewarded , but I know this is not the most rigorous test I could apply . 
Economists have been trying to produce more robust answers to those questions . 
Thomas Philippon and Ariell Reshef , for the National Bureau of Economic Research , have looked at a hundred years of data in the US , for pay in finance , and in other occupations . 
Their conclusions are fascinating . 
They find that if you control for educational attainment and skills , financial jobs were highly paid until the Great Depression of the 1930s , higher than the quality of the people who held the jobs would imply . 
Then from the Depression , and the introduction of new and tighter regulation , financial sector pay reverted to the norm , and remained there until around 1990 . 
But from that date up to 2006 it raced ahead and , on average , employees in financial firms were paid between a third and a half more than similarly qualified counterparts elsewhere . 
We just don &apos;t know yet whether the crisis will cause another reversion to the mean , but some downward adjustment looks likely . 
So there is some basis for saying they are overpaid , but why ? 
Philippon and Reshef argue that regulation , or deregulation is a big part of the story . 
Deregulation increased the opportunities for innovation and trading , and for profit . 
There is also evidence to support that proposition from the observable fact that rewards in the less regulated parts of the asset management sector- hedge funds etc- are typically higher than in Security and Exchange Commission regulated competitors . 
But is this a good enough explanation ? As rewards went up , why did new competitors , prepared to undercut , fail to come into the market ? 
In other parts of the economy , where we see excess returns , we usually look for some weakness in competition , or perhaps for the exploitation of insider information , which excludes new entrants . 
That may be part of the story , but competition for talent and for customers seems intense between investment banks and others , yet they have collectively been extravagantly rewarded at the expense of those customers . 
An alternative hypothesis , which seems to fit the facts , recently emerged from the Paul Woolley Centre for the Study of Dysfunctionality in Capital Markets , at the London School of Economics . 
Researchers there argue that in fragile speculative industries ( and finance has certainly been in that category in recent years ) it is hard for investors to monitor those who manage their money . 
They can see short-term returns , but they do not understand very well how those returns are generated . 
Managers can demand higher and higher returns in the upturn . 
But eventually these high returns reduce the payouts to investors ( Bernie Madoff may be the reduction 
If this explanation is broadly correct ( and it incorporates the deregulation point as well , as you can see ) then what can be done about it ? 
Politicians and regulators are exploring a number of options , from higher tax rates , through fines for certain types of bonus arrangements , to variable capital requirements . 
Higher taxes may be justified for other reasons , but are unlikely to solve the problem described . 
Regulators have struggled with the problem for years without finding a solution . 
The Bank of England has described the way in which remuneration policy can create risks for banks and said that , as a result , &quot; it is of increasing interest and concern to supervisors and regulators . &quot; 
But that was written in 1997 , and progress since then has been very slow , on both sides of the Atlantic . 
Shouldn &apos;t shareholders take more of an interest ? 
After all , it is their money which is at stake . 
They have earned low returns from financial sector investments , indeed those returns have been very strongly negative in the last two years . 
Shareholders seem to take little interests in pay policy . 
The arrival of &quot; say on pay &quot; provisions in the US - whereby boards will need to put their compensation policies to a shareholder vote in future- may focus minds , though the impact of similar provisions in the UK has been modest . 
Yet without shareholder pressure , all the signs are that the problem will persist .
