Hybrid Humans 
SINGAPORE - The election of a new pope always sparks debate about the tension between tradition and modernity in the Catholic Church . 
Perhaps more interesting is the ongoing modernization of the language in which those debates are conducted : Latin . 
While Catholic doctrines have evolved slowly , the Latin vocabulary has been expanding steadily in recent years , reflecting the surge of neologisms ( new words , usages , and expressions ) that has accompanied technology &apos;s increasingly prominent role in people &apos;s daily lives . 
The addition of terms like telephonium albo televisifico coniunctum ( video telepresence ) and usus agonisticus medicamenti stupecfactivi ( performance-enhancing drugs ) has helped to spark a revival of Latin education in the West , despite growing competition from Mandarin . 
Likewise , the English language &apos;s ability to produce and absorb neologisms is an important reason why it will endure as the world &apos;s lingua franca . 
The Oxford English Dictionary , now updated quarterly , revised more than 1,900 entries in its March 2011 edition , and added new terms , such as &quot; subdomain , &quot; &quot; dataveillance , &quot; and &quot; geotagging . &quot; 
Humans use language to make sense not only of specific concepts , but also of larger scientific , social , and historical movements . 
With technology changing the face - and pace - of such movements , devising terms that capture its far-reaching impact on human life is becoming increasingly important . 
For example , according to Nobel laureate Robert Fogel , medical and nutritional advances since the Industrial Revolution have accelerated and directed the evolutionary process , making modern humans a fundamentally different species from Homo sapiens . 
In 2011 , bio-technology investor Juan Enriquez coined the term Homo evolutis to denote this shift . 
But do widely accepted labels like &quot; Information Age &quot; and &quot; knowledge-based society &quot; adequately describe the global movement that is underway ? 
Technology-fueled development is causing historical eras to become cumulative , rather than linear . 
As the world enters the Information Age , most countries are still experiencing the Agricultural and Industrial Ages . 
In order to describe emerging socio-technological patterns - including the merging of scientific disciplines and the fusion of human life with progress in these fields - the current era should be called the &quot; Hybrid Age . &quot; 
It is an age , most tellingly , of proliferating new terminology . 
For example , we now have &quot; synthetic biology &quot; to describe a hybrid of biology and chemical engineering in which scientists create biological systems that are not found in nature . 
Man-made cells can now be inserted into humans . 
In 2010 , the biologist Craig Venter created the first fully synthetic and self-replicating cell . 
In another hybrid discipline , &quot; molecular computing , &quot; organic or artificial enzymes are programmed to conduct complex calculations faster than silicon chips . 
The field could provide an avenue , alongside 3D silicon chips , for maintaining - or even accelerating - the pace of Moore &apos;s Law , which states that the number of transistors on the integrated circuits used by computers doubles every two years . 
Humans &quot; biological hybridization with technology also requires new vocabulary . 
At the MIT Media Lab , double-amputee Hugh Herr has pioneered &quot; biomechatronics , &quot; which combines biology , mechanical engineering , and electronics to invent efficient , lifelike prosthetics . 
Some believe that Herr &apos;s work heralds an age of bionic superhumans . 
Moving from muscles to the mind , brain-computer interface technologies have advanced significantly in recent years , giving rise to &quot; neuro-prosthetics , &quot; which has already enabled paraplegics to navigate a computer mouse with their thoughts and monkeys to operate a giant robotic arm . 
Scientists are now working to pinpoint the neuro-chemistry of thought and emotions so accurately that new technologies could be developed to allow humans to communicate them silently . 
With scientists working tirelessly to refine such technologies , the public must become more knowledgeable about their socioeconomic implications . 
Neither of the existing paradigms for assessing individual potential - intelligence quotient and emotional quotient - can assess a person &apos;s ability to compete against the growing &quot; robo-collar &quot; workforce . 
Industrial robots are now displacing Foxconn workers making iPhones in China ; 
Increasingly sophisticated algorithms are replacing currency traders , paralegals , and even news reporters . 
Competing with the increasingly competent robotic labor force will require people to enhance their &quot; technology quotient . &quot; 
Societies and governments must drive this shift by boosting technology &apos;s role in both the form and content of educational curricula . 
Improved technological capacity would not only help citizens to compete for jobs ; it would help countries thrive in the new global environment of increasing hybridization . 
The rise and fall of empires has long been considered a geopolitical matter , based on factors such as military assets , resource endowments , and population size . 
Likewise , geo-economic calculations of relative GDP , terms of trade , and foreign-exchange reserves carry significant weight in determining the balance of power . 
But all of these metrics fail to account for factors like research and development , technological innovation , and commercialization , which are now more indicative of future success than nuclear arsenals or economic size . 
Indeed , the Hybrid Age is shaping up to be an era of &quot; geo-technology . &quot; 
The stakes of geo-technological competition are higher than ever . 
Cyberwarfare is proving to be as threatening to political and economic stability as conventional military conflict . 
At the same time , technologies like water filtration systems , drought-resistant seeds , renewable energy , and the Internet have the potential to fulfill the basic needs of a crowded planet better than any empire could . 
Many historical periods have been named after imperial hegemons : Pax Romana , Pax Britannica , Pax Americana . 
Some believe that , with the rise of China , Pax Sinica is next . 
But these eras have been characterized by conquest and exploitation , not peace .
