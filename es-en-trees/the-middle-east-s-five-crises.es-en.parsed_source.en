The Middle East &apos;s Five Crises 
The region between Egypt and Pakistan is a cauldron of five discrete , explosive components : Iraq &apos;s civil strife , Afghanistan &apos;s insurgency , Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions , the longstanding Israel-Arab conflict , and the risk of clashes between extremist groups and corrupt , repressive governments . 
A comprehensive policy is needed , yet the threats are so diverse and complex that separate approaches have to be applied simultaneously . 
In Iraq , America &apos;s policy of building a semi-federal state of Shiites , Sunnis , and Kurds runs a high risk of failure because of Shiite domination , Sunni and Shiite terrorism , Kurdish separatism , and meddling by Iran . 
The cost in lives is already unbearably high . 
The United States cannot sustain the current rate of casualties ( either American or Iraqi ) , or the expense . 
To create the conditions for long-term stability , a negotiated separation may be needed , comparable to the Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the war in former Yugoslavia . 
Separating Iraq &apos;s populations would be painful . 
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees ( UNHCR ) and the US-led coalition forces should help people who want to move to other parts of the country . 
One may object that to facilitate internal relocation is to collaborate with &quot; ethnic or religious cleansing &quot; ; but the toll of prolonged war in Iraq , which could lead to its dismemberment anyway , is much worse . 
The principle of pluralism is valuable , but curbing bloodshed deserves priority . 
A Dayton-like agreement can be achieved only if the UN Security Council backs it . 
It would be in the long-term interest of the permanent members to do so . 
Russia and China would , however , be helpful only if America changes the current Bush administration &apos;s approach . 
Such an initiative would need to be supported strongly by the European Union . 
Perhaps tri-partite mediation , backed by the US , the EU , and Russia would increase the chances . 
The Arab League and the Conference of Islamic States should be consulted and involved . 
The US and other coalition forces would have to withdraw gradually , beginning from the south of Iraq . 
Foreign forces would still be needed to help protect the Sunni population west of Baghdad and in the middle of Iraq against the Shiite south , as well as in the Kurdish north to keep Turkey from intervening . 
A peaceful separation agreement would require international peacekeepers with contributions from many powers , including Islamic states , India , China , and Japan . 
As stability in the Middle East is essential to them , this is a matter of enlightened self-interest . 
Those of Iraq &apos;s neighbors that are potential spoilers would need to be restrained by a Security Council mandate for such a Dayton-type settlement . 
In Afghanistan , NATO-led military operations against the neo-Taliban and other opponents of state-building offer only a partial and temporary solution . 
The influx of insurgents from Pakistan will not stop . 
The population sees little improvement in living conditions and expects Western forces to leave after a few years . 
Most Afghans will then be ruled again by tribal leaders , Islamists , drug barons , and warlords . 
The Western aim of building Afghanistan up as a stable and more or less democratic state is extremely ambitious ; it may be wiser to help stabilize Kabul and the relatively quiet northern part of the country . 
The difficult south will sooner or later return to Pashtun politics . 
The outside world &apos;s chief interest is to curb heroin production and destroy terrorist training camps . 
But destroying poppy crops has been turning Afghan farmers against NATO . 
Encouraging a shift to legal cash crops and food requires time and heavy investment . 
Meanwhile , international sanctions are unlikely to dissuade Iran &apos;s government from pursuing nuclear weapons , while a preventive strike by Israel - which would not sit idly by when Iranian nuclear forces become operational - or by the US , would encourage terrorist attacks against their populations . 
The most promising approach might be sanctions against leading personalities , and against transfers of technology and funding , as well as covert operations , to delay Iran &apos;s nuclear weapons program . 
In the meantime , Iran &apos;s youthful population may become more politically active and demand democratization and improved living conditions . 
It is uncertain how long the old clerical leadership and the country &apos;s nationalist politicians can hold on to power , although high oil and gas prices have been shielding them so far . 
Gaining time before a disastrous confrontation between Israel and Iran becomes inevitable would be smarter than taking an aggressive approach now . 
As for Israel and its neighbors , an agreement on the Golan Heights has already been prepared , but needs external mediation and pressure if it is to be signed . 
State-building in Lebanon will require strong UN and EU support , and the courage to curb Hezbollah &apos;s influence . 
The Israeli government and Palestinian political leaders are locked in a ruinous struggle , which merely aids extremists on both sides . 
The mutual struggle will therefore continue until there is strong enough external pressure to accept a peace agreement . 
Israel will have to vacate a large number of Jewish settlements on Palestinian territory , and accept joint international administration or division of Jerusalem . 
Israel will never agree to this unless forced by the US . 
A US-brokered peace agreement would need to be supported by the UN Security Council and implemented by peacekeeping troops with large contributions from many members of the UN . 
Of course , it is unlikely that the Bush administration would bring this about . 
So the new American president will have to take the lead in 2009 . 
In the meantime , the EU should get its act together and take clear decisions on a joint Middle East policy .
