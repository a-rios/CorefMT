Europe &apos;s New Watershed 
COPENHAGEN : The people of Belgrade have presented Europe with another watershed moment . 
Shadows from a decade of Balkan wars may at last be lifting . 
Clear heads , clear sights , and - most important of all - clear public consent will be needed if Europe is to move forward . 
In this regard , it is important to draw the right conclusions from Denmark &apos;s &quot; No &quot; vote in its recent referendum on whether or not to join the euro . 
The Danes are no more anti-European than anyone else . 
Xenophobia is no more widespread in Denmark than in other European countries . 
It was not just an unholy alliance between extreme left and extreme right , as some concluded , that defeated the euro . 
Denmark &apos;s &quot; No &quot; must be regarded as a warning to Europe &apos;s leaders - they should be far more careful when starting an open dialogue with their electorates on basic European issues , such as Europe &apos;s role in assuring Balkan peace . 
Otherwise they might run into the same saddening surprise as their Danish colleagues , where 4 out of 5 members of Parliament voted &quot; Yes &quot; on a policy only supported by 47 % of their constituents . 
My assertion that Danes are not anti-Europeans finds support in a recent Eurobarometer-poll : Voters in all EU-countries were asked if they regard enlargement of the Union with the applicant countries in Eastern and Central Europe as &quot; a priority . &quot; 
This was supported by close to 60 % of Danes . 
Indeed , Denmark topped the list . 
In France and Germany support was a meagre 20 % . 
Were other governments to follow Denmark &apos;s example and call a referendum on the Euro , most would probably lose . 
Let me recall the situation in 1992 , when a small majority of Danish voters ( less than 1 % ) rejected the Treaty of Maastricht . 
President Mitterrand reacted by calling for a similar referendum in France in order to support the Treaty . 
Surprising almost everybody in France , the referendum came as close to a &quot; No , &quot; as Denmark had been close to a &quot; Yes . &quot; 
This time Danish voters once again rejected the advice of their political establishment . 
What went wrong in Denmark might happen in other countries as well . 
Danish political leaders failed to convince their constituencies that the Euro should be regarded as a positive element in the creation of a Europe whole and free . 
Economic arguments failed to win them over - the decline of the Euro vis-a-vis the Dollar obviously playing an important psychological role in this . 
But too little emphasis was put on the political arguments . 
The Economic Monetary Union was created before the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 . 
As a new Europe began showing its face , the single currency was the bright creation of visionaries who saw the chance of making an even tighter relationship between European countries . 
Germany &apos;s political leaders - the Kohl-Genscher-generation who had experienced the war - understood that a united Germany would represent such a concentration of economic strength in Europe that it would inevitably disturb political balances within the EU . 
So German leaders concluded that they had to share their country &apos;s dominating position in monetary policies with others . 
As Hans Dietrich Genscher used to say in those days : &quot; If you want to avoid a German Europe , you must create a European Germany . &quot; 
It was a sacrifice , and was met with much resentment in German financial circles . 
But the Germans did it . 
We all owe them for that . 
The Euro has experienced a hard but promising start . 
It should not come as a surprise that the Euro started to slide against the Dollar , considering the differences in economic performance between America and Europe . 
And it should not come as a surprise that the markets have tested the willingness of European political leaders to keep quiet where monetary affairs are concerned . 
Recent intervention and support from America and Japan showed that the Euro is here to stay and that the markets believe in its success . 
The common currency is but one step in bringing together a peaceful Europe . 
This is the key message , but it was not delivered successfully to the Danes . 
This is why the result of the Danish referendum should be taken as a warning that great efforts must be made to convince Europe &apos;s citizens of the Euro &apos;s political importance - and of the importance of enlarging the Union . 
Enlargement of the European Union eastward is the great challenge of the coming years . 
Of course , living standards are not as high in Eastern Europe as in the west , but the hope - for both applicant countries and those in the Balkans - must be that ongoing democratization and economic reform will mean eventual membership in the EU . 
Undoubtedly , expansion will provide the &quot; older &quot; democracies with new growth markets . 
The benefits of this will more than compensate for the economic costs of enlargement . 
But even stronger than this economic common-sense-argument is the political imperative : if we maintain a divided Europe , we will never reach the Europe of liberty and peace that was the original vision of the founding fathers that wrote The Treaty of Rome . 
The new democracies of Eastern and Central Europe and the Baltic countries are eager to participate in the EU . 
The brave crowds in Belgrade demonstrated the desire of Serbs to rejoin the family of Europe . 
All want to take part in the growth and solidarity of a Europe where democracy and respect are the ruling civic concepts , not brute military power . 
The Danes failed to link this with the role of the Euro . 
The events in Belgrade have provided another moment for that too-long-postponed debate on the larger goals of European integration to take place .
