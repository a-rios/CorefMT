Will Emerging Markets Fall in 2012 ? 
BERN - Emerging markets have performed amazingly well over the last seven years . 
In many cases , they have far outperformed the advanced industrialized countries in terms of economic growth , debt-to-GDP ratios , countercyclical fiscal policy , and assessments by ratings agencies and financial markets . 
As 2012 begins , however , investors are wondering if emerging markets may be due for a correction , triggered by a new wave of &quot; risk off &quot; behavior . 
Will China experience a hard landing ? 
Will a decline in commodity prices hit Latin America ? 
Will the European Union &apos;s sovereign-debt woes spread to neighbors such as Turkey ? 
Indeed , few believe that the rapid economic growth and high trade deficits that Turkey has experienced in recent years can be sustained . 
Likewise , high GDP growth rates in Brazil and Argentina over the same period could soon reverse , particularly if global commodity prices fall - not a remote prospect if the Chinese economy begins to falter or global real interest rates rise this year . 
China , in turn , could land hard as its real-estate bubble deflates and the country &apos;s banks are forced to work off the bad loans . 
This is not wild doom-and-gloom speculation . 
The World Bank has just downgraded economic forecasts for developing countries in its 2012 Global Economic Prospects , released this month . 
For example , Brazil &apos;s annual GDP growth , which came to a halt in the third quarter of 2011 , is forecast to reach 3.4 % in 2012 , less than half the 7.5 % rate recorded in 2010 . 
Reflecting a sharp slowdown in the second half of the year in India , South Asia is slowing from a torrid six years , which included 9.1 % growth in 2010 . 
Regional growth is projected to decelerate further , to 5.8 % , in 2012 . 
Three possible lines of argument - empirical , literary , and causal , each admittedly tentative and tenuous - support the worry that emerging markets &quot; economic performance could suffer dramatically in 2012 . 
The empirical argument is simply historically based numerology : emerging-market crises seem to come in a 15-year cycle . 
The international debt crisis that erupted in mid-1982 began in Mexico , and then spread to the rest of Latin America and beyond . 
The East Asian crisis came 15 years later , hitting Thailand in mid-1997 , and spreading from there to the rest of the region and beyond . 
We are now another 15 years down the road . 
So is 2012 the year for another emerging-markets crisis ? 
The hypothesis of regular boom-bust cycles is supported by a long-standing scholarly literature , such as the writings of the American economist Carmen Reinhart . 
Joseph prophesied that there would come seven years of plenty , with abundant harvests from an overflowing Nile , followed by seven lean years , with famine resulting from drought . 
His forecast turned out to be accurate . 
Fortunately , the Pharaoh had empowered his technocratic official ( Joseph ) to save grain in the seven years of plenty , building up sufficient stockpiles to save the Egyptian people from starvation during the bad years . 
That is a valuable lesson for today &apos;s government officials in industrialized and developing countries alike . 
For emerging markets , the first seven-year phase of plentiful capital flows occurred in 1975-1981 , with the recycling of petrodollars in the form of loans to developing countries . 
The international debt crisis that began in Mexico in 1982 catalyzed the seven lean years , known in Latin America as the &quot; lost decade . &quot; 
The turnaround year , 1989 , was marked by the first issue of Brady bonds ( dollar-denominated bonds issued by Latin American countries ) , which helped the region to get past the crisis . 
The second cycle of seven fat years was the period of record capital flows to emerging markets in 1990-1996 . 
Following the East Asia crisis of 1997 came seven years of capital drought . 
The third cycle of inflows occurred in 2004-2011 , persisting even through the global financial crisis . 
If history repeats itself , it is now time for a third &quot; sudden stop &quot; of capital flows to emerging markets . 
Are a couple of data points and a biblical parable enough to take the hypothesis of a 15-year cycle seriously ? 
Perhaps , if we have some sort of causal theory that could explain such periodicity to international capital flows . 
Here is a possibility : 15 years is how long it takes for individual loan officers and hedge-fund traders to be promoted out of their jobs . 
Today &apos;s young crop of asset pickers knows that there was a crisis in Turkey in 2001 , but they did not experience it first hand . 
They think that perhaps this time is different . 
If emerging markets crash in 2012 , remember where you heard it first - in ancient Egypt .
