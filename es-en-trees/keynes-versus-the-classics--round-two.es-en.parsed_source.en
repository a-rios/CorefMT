Keynes versus the Classics : Round Two 
LONDON - The economist John Maynard Keynes wrote The General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money ( 1936 ) to &quot; bring to an issue the deep divergences of opinion between fellow economists which have for the time being almost destroyed the practical influence of economic theory ... &quot; Seventy years later , heavyweight economists are still at each other &apos;s throats , in terms almost unchanged from the 1930 &quot; s . 
The latest slugfest features New Keynesian champion Paul Krugman of Princeton University and New Classical champion John Cochrane of the University of Chicago . 
Krugman recently published a newspaper article entitled &quot; How Did Economists Get It So Wrong ? &quot; 
There was nothing in mainstream economics , Krugman wrote , &quot; suggesting the possibility of the kind of collapse that happened last year . &quot; 
The reason was that &quot; economists , as a group , mistook beauty , clad in impressive-looking math , for truth . &quot; 
They purveyed an &quot; idealized vision of an economy in which rational individuals interact in perfect markets . &quot; 
Unfortunately &quot; this sanitized vision of the economy led most economists to ignore all the things that could go wrong . &quot; 
So now economists will have to accept &quot; the importance of irrational and often unpredictable behavior , face up to the often idiosyncratic imperfections of markets and accept that an elegant economic &quot; theory of everything &quot; is a long way off . &quot; 
Krugman &apos;s heavy pounding of Chicago School economics goaded Cochrane , a professor of finance , into some bad-tempered counter-punching on the university &apos;s Web site , much of which consisted of a personal attack on Krugman &apos;s scientific integrity . 
When he gets around to economics , Cochrane aims his blows at two points : Krugman &apos;s attack on the &quot; efficient market theory &quot; and his advocacy of &quot; fiscal stimulus &quot; for depressed economies . 
Cochrane accuses Krugman of misleading his readers about the efficient market theory , which asserts that , given the available information , financial markets always get asset prices right . 
Rather than defend that theory , Cochrane admits that &quot; asset prices move more than reasonable expectations of future cash flows . &quot; 
Unfortunately , &quot; no theory is particularly good at that right now . &quot; 
But it &apos;s theoretical nihilism , Cochrane argues , to ascribe these excessive fluctuations to &quot; irrationality &quot; as Krugman does . 
What Krugman is really after ( &quot; though he can &apos;t quite come out and say this &quot; ) is for the government to &quot; take charge of the allocation of capital . &quot; 
And the one thing we do know is that however badly asset markets behave , government control &quot; has always been much worse . &quot; 
Cochrane &apos;s heaviest punching is reserved for Krugman &apos;s support for President Barack Obama &apos;s fiscal stimulus . 
He invokes the hoary old &quot; Ricardian equivalence theorem , &quot; revived by the Harvard economist Robert Barro , according to whom &quot; debt-financed spending can &apos;t have any effect , because people , seeing the higher future taxes that must pay off the debt , will simply save more . 
They will buy the new government debt and leave all spending decisions unaltered . &quot; 
In short , Krugman &quot; has absolutely no idea about what caused the crash , what policies might have prevented it , and what policies we should adopt going forward &quot; - except that the government should now spend money like a drunken sailor . 
Far from having too much math , economists need more , in order to &quot; keep the logic straight . &quot; 
On the stimulus , though , Krugman achieves a knock-out punch . 
The view that extra government spending &quot; crowds out &quot; an equal amount of private spending , so that its net stimulus effect is zero , would be true only if the economy were at full employment . 
Indeed , the Chicago School tacitly assumes that economies are always at full employment . 
They are unfazed by the fact that America &apos;s economy has shrunk by 4 % in the last year and that over 6 million people have been added to the unemployment rolls . 
To Chicago economists , an increase in the number of idle workers represents a voluntary choice for leisure . 
In a concession to commonsense , they concede that people may make mistakes and , to that extent , a stimulus may be beneficial . 
But they insist that the only stimulus that will work is printing money . 
This will drive down interest rates and lead to an economic rebound . 
Against this view , Keynes pointed out that interest-rate reductions may not do the job , because at zero or near-zero rates investors hoard cash rather than lend it out . 
Hence , as he put it in 1932 , there may be &quot; no escape from prolonged and perhaps interminable depression except by direct state intervention to promote and subsidize new investment &quot; - which is what the Obama administration is rightly doing . 
On the question of what caused the crash , the debate is more even . 
Krugman is hampered by the fact that he attributes the crash to &quot; irrationality , &quot; which , as Cochrane points out , is no theory . 
This is because Krugman refuses to take seriously Keynes &apos;s crucial distinction between risk and uncertainty . 
In my view , Keynes &apos;s major contribution to economic theory was to emphasize the &quot; extreme precariousness of the basis of knowledge on which our estimates of prospective yield have to be made . &quot; 
The fact of their ignorance forces investors to fall back on certain conventions , of which the most important are that the present will continue into the future , that existing share prices sum up future prospects , and that if most people believe something , they must be right . 
This makes for considerable stability in markets as long as the conventions hold . 
But they are liable to being overturned suddenly in the face of passing bad news , because &quot; there is no firm basis of conviction to hold them steady . &quot; 
It &apos;s like what happens in a crowded theater if someone shouts &quot; Fire ! &quot; 
Everyone rushes to get out . 
This is not &quot; irrational &quot; behavior . 
It is reasonable behavior in the face of uncertainty . 
In essence , this is what happened last autumn . 
Chicago School economics has never been more vulnerable than it is today - and deservedly so . 
But the attack on it will never succeed unless policy Keynesians like Krugman are willing to work out the implications of irreducible uncertainty for economic theory .
