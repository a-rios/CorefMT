Don &apos;t Feed the Dragon 
The European Union , after a three-year spat with President Bush , is keen to be regarded as a world player to be reckoned with . 
Many EU leaders see newfound respect coming in the form of a &quot; strategic partnership &quot; with China that is designed to balance the power of the United States . 
Some want that partnership to include trade in advanced weaponry - witness the recent push to remove the EU &apos;s 15-year-old ban on arms sales to China . 
Although America objects strongly , a number of Europeans shrug off any opposition . 
But China is no ordinary trading partner . 
If not openly committed to opposing Western values and interests , China &apos;s interests in cowing Taiwan and in asserting regional hegemony across Asia certainly are not those of Europe and the West , not to mention Japan , India , and the rest of Asia . 
Indeed , China stood with Russia , Belarus , and a few other despotic regimes in prematurely recognizing the thuggish , ballot-stuffing Viktor Yanukovych as President of Ukraine . 
This should come as no surprise , as the Chinese government does not plan to hold free and fair elections soon . 
Indeed , perhaps Ukraine &apos;s Orange Revolution , with those thousands of protesters in Kiev &apos;s Independence Square served as a potent reminder to China &apos;s leaders of the Tiananmen Square protests 15 years ago , and - in contrast to Ukraine - their own strategy of brutal repression . 
If not as dark as 15 years ago , China &apos;s human rights record remains abysmal . 
The British Foreign Office &apos;s annual human rights report for 2004 , the most comprehensive in the EU , condemns China &apos;s extensive use of the death penalty ( even for such crimes as corruption , pimping , drug offenses , and tax fraud ) , its systematic torture of dissidents , and its restrictions on freedom of speech - including the Internet - and religion . 
All of these abuses are raised repeatedly at EU-China summits , to little or no avail . 
So is this the time to end the arms ban imposed by both Europe and America after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 ? 
China &apos;s human rights record is not the only problem . 
It is bad enough that no mechanism exists to prevent China &apos;s government from using EU arms for internal repression . 
But nor does any mechanism exist that would stop China from re-exporting the weapons to places like North Korea . 
Indeed , China has a track record as a serial proliferator , having helped Pakistan build its atomic bomb . 
Its role in providing missile and rocket propulsion materials to Iran remains unclear . 
Yet France and Germany , with Britain and Italy not far behind , say such criticism is outdated . 
( They are strongly opposed by Holland , the Scandinavian countries , and the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe , which are familiar with communist repression . ) 
Supporters of lifting the arms export ban argue that this litany of sins does not reflect China &apos;s real improvements in human rights and penalizes European armaments jobs to the benefit of Russia , which enjoys a lively arms trade with its neighbor ( something it might one day regret ) . 
For France , lifting the embargo is also an important symbol , one that recognizes China &apos;s role in fighting Islamist terrorism . 
Libya had such EU restrictions lifted last October ostensibly for joining the fight against terrorism and abandoning its weapons of mass destruction . 
In addition , those in favor of reviving EU-China arms trade see such sales as a stabilizer in bouts of political turbulence and are loath to let bad politics interfere with good business . 
China apologists claim that the 1998 EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports is sufficient to limit arms sales . 
But they conveniently ignore the fact that the Code of Conduct is voluntary and thus not enforceable . 
Can anything pull the Atlantic alliance &apos;s policies on arms exports together ? 
Trade with a country with China &apos;s human rights record must not only make economic sense ; it must also fit the wider aims of foreign policy . 
Just as American presidents looked foolish when they bent US foreign policy to the dictates of American wheat farmers in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s , European governments that are prepared to mortgage Asian security to a restless China also command no respect . 
The lesson is clear : security interests must come before business interests . 
So transatlantic coordination is needed , to ensure that any trade of sophisticated arms and weapons-related technologies with China does nothing to enhance China &apos;s military power , and that competition between Western producers of goods that may legitimately be sold to China does not damage Western political unity . 
In the Cold War era , there was a mechanism for such trade . 
From 1949 until the fall of the Berlin Wall , the Consultative Group Coordinating Committee ( Cocom ) monitored and controlled the export of Western technology to the Soviet Union . 
It did so by a gentlemen &apos;s agreement , and with reasonable success . 
Cocom provided an opportunity to settle squabbles and plug loopholes quietly . 
Something similar is urgently needed now .
