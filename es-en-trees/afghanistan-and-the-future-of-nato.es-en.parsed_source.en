Afghanistan and the Future of NATO 
Things aren &apos;t going well in Afghanistan . 
Sometime at the turn of 2001 / 2002 , the Bush administration concluded that the stabilization and reconstruction of Afghanistan was no longer its top priority and decided to bet instead on military-led regime change in Iraq . 
Afghanistan can thus rightly be seen as the first victim of the administration &apos;s misguided strategy . 
But the Bush administration is not the sole culprit for the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan . 
It was NATO &apos;s job to ensure the country &apos;s stability and security , and thus NATO &apos;s weak General Secretary and the European allies , especially Germany and France , share the responsibility for the worsening situation . 
Yet , despite all the difficulties , the situation in Afghanistan , unlike that in Iraq , is not hopeless . 
There was a good reason for going to war in Afghanistan in the first place , because the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , originated there . 
Once undertaken , the West &apos;s intervention ended an almost uninterrupted civil war , and is still viewed with approval by a majority of the population . 
Finally , unlike in Iraq , the intervention did not fundamentally rupture the inner structure of the Afghan state or threaten its very cohesion . 
If the West pursues realistic aims , and does so with perseverance , its main objective - a stable central government that can drive back the Taliban , hold the country together and , with the help of the international community , ensure the country &apos;s development - is still achievable . 
There are four preconditions of the West &apos;s success : 
establishment of Afghan security forces strong enough to drive back the Taliban , limit drug cultivation , and create domestic stability ; willingness on the part of NATO to remain militarily engaged without any national reservations - with Germany and France in particular giving up the special conditions of their involvement ; a significant increase in development aid , especially for the so far neglected Southern part of the country ; renewal of the regional consensus reached in Bonn in 2001 , under which the reconstruction of the Afghan state was to be supported by all the parties concerned . 
The war in Afghanistan was never just an Afghan civil war ; rather , for decades the country has been a stage of regional conflicts and hegemonic struggles . 
So , while the rebirth of the Taliban is in part due to the woefully neglected reconstruction of the Pashto Southern and Eastern part of the country , it also has external causes . 
Most notably , for more than two years now , Pakistan has been moving away from the Bonn consensus , betting on the rebirth of the Taliban and giving it massive support . 
Indeed , without Taliban sanctuaries on the Pakistani side of the Afghan border , and without Pakistani financial backing , the rebirth of the Taliban &apos;s armed insurgency against the central Afghan government would have been impossible . 
Pakistan &apos;s actions are explained mainly by its strategic readjustment in light of US weakness in Iraq and the region as a whole , and by the newly strengthened relationships between India and Afghanistan , resulting in an increased Indian presence in Central Asia . 
In this connection , Pakistan views the Karzai government in Kabul as unfriendly to Islamabad and a threat to its key strategic interests . 
Without Taliban sanctuaries on the Pakistani side of the Afghan border and the backing by the Pakistani intelligence service ISI , the rebirth of the Taliban &apos;s armed insurgency against the central Afghan government would have been impossible . 
But , by aiding the Taliban , Pakistan is playing with fire , because there are now also Pakistani Talibans who pose a threat to Pakistan . 
US policy toward Pakistan is also dangerously shortsighted and reminiscent of the mistakes the US made in Iran prior to the 1979 Islamic revolution . 
Nevertheless , the US at least has a Pakistan policy - which is more than can be said about NATO and Europe . 
In fact , it is all but incomprehensible that while the future of NATO is being decided in the Hindu Kush mountains , and while thousands of European soldiers stationed there are risking their lives , Pakistan - the key to the success or failure of the mission in Afghanistan - is not given any role in NATO &apos;s plans and calculations . 
Part of NATO &apos;s trouble stems from the fact that a number of member states insist on the right to make their own military and political decisions , and these &quot; national reservations &quot; severely limit NATO &apos;s ability to act . 
If NATO is to succeed , this must change without further delay . 
A NATO summit , during which all members would take stock of the situation and draw the appropriate conclusions , is therefore long overdue . 
The national reservations must be go , and a joint strategy for success must be adopted , including a massive increase in civilian and military aid for Afghanistan , if the country is to be prevented from descending into the same abyss as Iraq . 
Moreover , a regional consensus among all the players must be rebuilt , including Pakistan , Iran , and India , whose joint responsibility for peace , stability , and redevelopment in Afghanistan must be recognized by Europe and the US . 
To accomplish this , a follow-up conference to the Bonn Agreement is also required . 
While the war in Iraq has been based on wishful thinking , the war in Afghanistan was necessary and unavoidable because it was there that the terrorist threat of September 11 , 2001 , originated . 
It would be more than a tragedy - it would be unparalleled political folly - if , because of a lack of commitment and political foresight , the West were to squander its successes in Afghanistan . 
Europe would have to pay an unacceptably high price , and NATO &apos;s future would likely be jeopardized .
