The Global Economy on the Fly 
ISTANBUL - In the last four weeks , I have traveled to Sofia , Kuala Lumpur , Dubai , London , Milan , Frankfurt , Berlin , Paris , Beijing , Tokyo , Istanbul , and throughout the United States . 
As a result , the myriad challenges facing the global economy were never far away . 
In Europe , the tail risk of a eurozone break-up and a loss of market access by Spain and Italy were reduced by last summer &apos;s decision by the European Central Bank to backstop sovereign debt . 
But the monetary union &apos;s fundamental problems - low potential growth , ongoing recession , loss of competitiveness , and large stocks of private and public debt - have not been resolved . 
Moreover , the grand bargain between the eurozone core , the ECB , and the periphery - painful austerity and reforms in exchange for large-scale financial support - is now breaking down , as austerity fatigue in the eurozone periphery runs up against bailout fatigue in core countries like Germany and the Netherlands . 
Austerity fatigue in the periphery is clearly evident from the success of anti-establishment forces in Italy &apos;s recent election ; large street demonstrations in Spain , Portugal , and elsewhere ; and now the botched bailout of Cypriot banks , which has fueled massive public anger . 
Throughout the periphery , populist parties of the left and right are gaining ground . 
Meanwhile , Germany &apos;s insistence on imposing losses on bank creditors in Cyprus is the latest symptom of bailout fatigue in the core . 
Other core eurozone members , eager to limit the risks to their taxpayers , have similarly signaled that creditor &quot; bail-ins &quot; are the way of the future . 
Outside the eurozone , even the United Kingdom is struggling to restore growth , owing to the damage caused by front-loaded fiscal-consolidation efforts , while anti-austerity sentiment is also mounting in Bulgaria , Romania , and Hungary . 
In China , the leadership transition has occurred smoothly . 
But the country &apos;s economic model remains , as former Premier Wen Jiabao famously put it , &quot; unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated , and unsustainable . &quot; 
China &apos;s problems are many : regional imbalances between its coastal regions and the interior , and between urban and rural areas ; too much savings and fixed investment , and too little private consumption ; growing income and wealth inequality ; and massive environmental degradation , with air , water , and soil pollution jeopardizing public health and food safety . 
The country &apos;s new leaders speak earnestly of deepening reforms and rebalancing the economy , but they remain cautious , gradualist , and conservative by inclination . 
Moreover , the power of vested interests that oppose reform - state-owned enterprises , provincial governments , and the military , for example - has yet to be broken . 
As a result , the reforms needed to rebalance the economy may not occur fast enough to prevent a hard landing when , by next year , an investment bust materializes . 
In China - and in Russia ( and partly in Brazil and India ) - state capitalism has become more entrenched , which does not bode well for growth . 
Overall , these four countries ( the BRICs ) have been over-hyped , and other emerging economies may do better in the next decade : Malaysia , the Philippines , and Indonesia in Asia ; 
Chile , Colombia , and Peru in Latin America ; and Kazakhstan , Azerbaijan , and Poland in Eastern Europe and Central Asia . 
Farther East , Japan is trying a new economic experiment to stop deflation , boost economic growth , and restore business and consumer confidence . 
&quot; Abenomics &quot; has several components : aggressive monetary stimulus by the Bank of Japan ; a fiscal stimulus this year to jump start demand , followed by fiscal austerity in 2014 to rein in deficits and debt ; a push to increase nominal wages to boost domestic demand ; structural reforms to deregulate the economy ; and new free-trade agreements - starting with the Trans-Pacific Partnership - to boost trade and productivity . 
But the challenges are daunting . 
It is not clear if deflation can be beaten with monetary policy ; excessive fiscal stimulus and deferred austerity may make the debt unsustainable ; and the structural-reform components of Abenomics are vague . 
Moreover , tensions with China over territorial claims in the East China Sea may adversely affect trade and foreign direct investment . 
Then there is the Middle East , which remains an arc of instability from the Maghreb to Pakistan . 
Turkey - with a young population , high potential growth , and a dynamic private sector - seeks to become a major regional power . 
But Turkey faces many challenges of its own . 
Its bid to join the European Union is currently stalled , while the eurozone recession dampens its growth . 
Its current-account deficit remains large , and monetary policy has been confusing , as the objective of boosting competitiveness and growth clashes with the need to control inflation and avoid excessive credit expansion . 
Moreover , while rapprochement with Israel has become more likely , Turkey faces severe tensions with Syria and Iran , and its Islamist ruling party must still prove that it can coexist with the country &apos;s secular political tradition . 
In this fragile global environment , has America become a beacon of hope ? 
The US is experiencing several positive economic trends : housing is recovering ; shale gas and oil will reduce energy costs and boost competitiveness ; job creation is improving ; rising labor costs in Asia and the advent of robotics and automation are underpinning a manufacturing resurgence ; and aggressive quantitative easing is helping both the real economy and financial markets . 
But risks remain . 
Unemployment and household debt remain stubbornly high . 
The fiscal drag from rising taxes and spending cuts will hit growth , and the political system is dysfunctional , with partisan polarization impeding compromise on the fiscal deficit , immigration , energy policy , and other key issues that influence potential growth . 
In sum , among advanced economies , the US is in the best relative shape , followed by Japan , where Abenomics is boosting confidence . 
The eurozone and the UK remain mired in recessions made worse by tight monetary and fiscal policies . 
Among emerging economies , China could face a hard landing by late 2014 if critical structural reforms are postponed , and the other BRICs need to turn away from state capitalism . 
While other emerging markets in Asia and Latin America are showing more dynamism than the BRICs , their strength will not be enough to turn the global tide .
