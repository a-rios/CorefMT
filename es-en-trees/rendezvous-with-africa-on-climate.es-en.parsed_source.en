Rendezvous with Africa on Climate 
PARIS - After a long series of preparatory meetings , the Copenhagen summit on climate change is finally upon us . 
With the Kyoto Protocol on carbon emissions expiring in 2012 , the delegates who will gather in Copenhagen have been given the task of concluding a new international agreement . 
The world &apos;s countries are engaging in one of the most complex and consequential exercises in collective action that has ever had to be managed in the history of international relations . 
Although the responsibility of industrialized countries and emerging economies in the battle against carbon emissions is now well known , Africa &apos;s place in the climate agenda has been largely neglected . 
Sub-Saharan emissions , estimated at only 3 % to 4 % of global man-made emissions , are deemed of little interest . 
Yet Africa is central to the global environmental crisis in two important ways . 
First , Africa would be the first victim of major climate disturbance - with side-effects on the whole planet . 
Experts predict that the continent will experience some of the gravest changes , whereas the capacity of African societies to respond to them is among the weakest in the world . 
Several African countries are already experiencing reduced rainfall , soil degradation , and the depletion of precious natural resources , which has a direct impact on the livelihoods of two-thirds of Sub-Saharan Africans . 
The economic , social , migratory , and security consequences of such vulnerability on the rest of the world cannot be ignored , as Africa will be home to more than two billion inhabitants in 2050 . 
Second , Africa is one of the important actors in the global environmental crisis . 
Because of its vast natural heritage , the continent contains some of the most potent solutions to climate change . 
The Congo basin represents the second largest mass of tropical forest in the world , with 220 million hectares . 
At a time when carbon emissions are rapidly rising worldwide , this gigantic carbon-capture machine is , like agricultural land , one of the essential elements of global climate control . 
And yet Africa &apos;s forest coverage fell by 10 % between 1990 and 2005 - more than half the recorded global shrinkage . 
Moreover , Africa will experience by far the largest growth in energy requirements of any world region in the next 50 years . 
The fight against climate change will be waged in large part over whether Africa &apos;s energy needs are met with fossil fuels or renewable energies . 
It is vital that the Copenhagen delegates recognize and promote Africa &apos;s contribution to the world &apos;s delicate climatic balance . 
Efforts to preserve Africa &apos;s natural resources and to exploit the vast potential of the sub-continent &apos;s renewable energies are not free . 
Three promising tracks will have to materialize rapidly . 
The first consists in increasing the use of existing tools , such as Clean Development Mechanisms ( CDMs ) , which enable actors from rich countries to promote projects that reduce emissions in developing countries . 
Up to now , Africa has missed out on the benefits of CDMs : to date , less than 2 % of these projects take place in Africa , compared to 73 % for Asia . 
Africa ought to be the global carbon market &apos;s new frontier . 
The second track is official recognition of the carbon storage of African lands and forests , as well as rewards for &quot; avoided deforestation . &quot; 
At a time when humanity is coming to measure the value of biodiversity and the importance of land and forests in climate control , Africa has much to gain by making itself the guardian of a heritage that is essential to humanity &apos;s survival . 
This is worth several billion dollars annually , which could constitute one of the essential stepping-stones to sustained economic growth in Africa in a post-petroleum era . 
Finally , the &quot; climate justice &quot; plan sponsored by France and others in Copenhagen , which aims to increase Africans &quot; access to clean energy , is crucial at a time when three of ten sub-Saharan Africans have no access to electricity . 
It is a question not only of justice , but also of climate regulation . 
Linking public and private efforts to provide two billion Africans with renewable energy will therefore be one of the major challenges of the coming decades . 
In the past , African countries found it difficult to make their voices heard in major international negotiations . 
Their decision to act as a bloc in Copenhagen is an important step forward .
