Asia &apos;s New Security Trifecta 
NEW DELHI - Winter is India &apos;s diplomatic high season , with the cool , sunny weather forming an ideal backdrop for pageantry , photo ops at the Taj Mahal or Delhi &apos;s Red Fort , and bilateral deal-making . 
The first to arrive was South Korean President Park Geun-hye . 
Despite a strong economic foundation , the bilateral relationship has long lacked a meaningful security dimension . 
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un &apos;s unpredictable and often provocative policies represent an additional impetus for improved ties - as do China &apos;s increasingly visible plans to weaken South Korea &apos;s alliance with the United States . 
Not surprisingly , the discussions during Park &apos;s four-day visit focused on grand strategy , and included detailed talks on maritime security and naval shipbuilding . 
Nuclear energy also featured prominently on the agenda , owing to both countries &quot; dependence on energy imported through dangerous sea-lanes . 
In 2008 , South Korea , as a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group , supported the waiver granting India access to civilian nuclear technology and fuel from other countries - both of which it had been denied since becoming a nuclear-weapons power in 1974 . 
Indeed , India &apos;s nuclear tests are what initially spurred the NSG &apos;s formation . 
South Korea &apos;s support of India &apos;s civilian nuclear ambitions earned it high praise in India and helped to advance bilateral civilian nuclear cooperation . 
This budding strategic partnership is undoubtedly important . 
While India &apos;s relationship with the United States has been faltering of late , following the arrest and mistreatment of an Indian consular official in New York , its ties with Japan are flourishing . 
The visit last December of Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko was the clearest sign yet of a de facto alliance between the two democracies . 
The imperial couple last visited India more than a half-century ago , as Crown Prince and Princess , when India was part of the non-aligned movement and Japan was happy with a security guarantee from the US . 
The search for greater security was even more explicit in January , when Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera spent four days in India discussing the specifics of enhanced defense cooperation . 
During the meeting , Onodera and his Indian counterpart affirmed their countries &quot; intention to &quot; strengthen the Strategic and Global Partnership between Japan and India , &quot; including &quot; measures ranging from regular joint-combat exercises and military exchanges to cooperation in anti-piracy , maritime security , and counter-terrorism . &quot; 
In fact , later this year , bilateral naval exercises will be held in Japanese waters for the first time - sending a powerful signal to China . 
But Indo-Japanese relations must extend beyond the realm of security - something that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , who has pursued enhanced bilateral ties more vigorously than any other Japanese leader , seems to grasp . 
Convinced that a strong India is in Japan &apos;s best interests , and vice versa , Abe hopes to create a new &quot; arc of freedom and prosperity &quot; connecting Asia &apos;s two major democratic economies . 
While Abe could have done more during his recent visit to India to advance this vision -for example , by meeting with Indian opposition leader Narendra Modi , who may become the country &apos;s next prime minister - it seems certain that such a relationship will be achieved in the coming years . 
Japan has already surpassed the US as one of India &apos;s largest sources of foreign direct investment , accounting for inflows totaling $ 2.2 billion last year . 
Abe , India &apos;s chief guest at this year &apos;s Republic Day celebrations , also rightly views enhanced trade as a key element in deepening the bilateral relationship , thereby contributing to substantially increased security . 
Even with a significant deepening of ties , however , bilateral relationships alone will be inadequate to counterbalance China . 
Achieving an internal Asian balance of power will require India , Japan , and South Korea to build a tripartite security arrangement , which can be achieved only if Japanese and South Korean leaders overcome their historical animosities . 
As Winston Churchill declared in his famous 1946 speech in Zurich , &quot; We cannot afford to drag forward across the years that are to come the hatreds and revenges which have sprung from the injuries of the past . &quot; 
Just as France and Germany pursued reconciliation in order to build a better future in the years following Churchill &apos;s declaration , Japan and South Korea must learn to tame the hatreds and injuries of the past in order to build , with India , a structure of peace and a more prosperous future for Asia .
