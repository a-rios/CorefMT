Global Warming &apos;s Cheap , Effective Solution 
COPENHAGEN - Global warming will mean that more people die from the heat . 
There will be a rise in sea levels , more malaria , starvation , and poverty . 
Concern has been great , but humanity has done very little that will actually prevent these outcomes . 
Carbon emissions have kept increasing , despite repeated promises of cuts . 
We all have a stake in ensuring that climate change is stopped . 
We turned to climate scientists to inform us about the problem of global warming . 
Now we need to turn to climate economists to enlighten us about the benefits , costs , and possible outcomes from different responses to this challenge . 
World leaders are meeting in Copenhagen this December to forge a new pact to tackle global warming . 
Should they continue with plans to make carbon-cutting promises that are unlikely to be fulfilled ? 
Should they instead delay reductions for 20 years ? 
What could be achieved by planting more trees , cutting methane , or reducing black soot emissions ? 
Is it sensible to focus on a technological solution to warming ? 
Or should we just adapt to a warmer world ? 
Much of the current policy debate remains focused on cutting carbon , but there are many ways to go about repairing the global climate . 
Our choices will result in different outcomes and different costs . 
The optimal combination of solutions will create the biggest impact for the least money . 
A groundbreaking paper by economists Eric Bickel and Lee Lane is one of the first - and certainly the most comprehensive - study of the costs and benefits of climate engineering . 
Deliberately manipulating the earth &apos;s climate seems like something from science fiction . 
But as President Barack Obama &apos;s science adviser , John Holdren , has said it has &quot; got to be looked at , &quot; and many prominent scientists agree . 
Bickel and Lane offer compelling evidence that a tiny investment in climate engineering might be able to reduce as much of global warming &apos;s effects as trillions of dollars spent on carbon emission reductions . 
Climate engineering has the advantage of speed . 
There is a significant delay between carbon cuts and any temperature drop - even halving global emissions by mid-century would barely be measurable by the end of the century . 
Making green energy cheap and prevalent will also take a long time . 
Consider that electrification of the global economy is still incomplete after more than a century of effort . 
Many methods of atmospheric engineering have been proposed . 
Solar radiation management appears to be one of the most hopeful . 
Atmospheric greenhouse gases allow sunlight to pass through but absorb heat and radiate some down to the earth &apos;s surface . 
All else being equal , higher concentrations will warm the planet . 
Solar radiation management would bounce a little sunlight back into space . 
Reflecting just 1-2 % of the total sunlight that strikes the earth could offset as much warming as that caused by doubling preindustrial levels of greenhouse gases . 
When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991 , about a million tons of sulfur dioxide was pumped into the stratosphere , reacting with water to form a hazy layer that spread around the globe , and - by scattering and absorbing incoming sunlight - cooled the earth &apos;s surface for almost two years . 
We could mimic this effect through stratospheric aerosol insertion - essentially launching material like sulfur dioxide or soot into the stratosphere . 
Another promising approach is marine cloud whitening , which sprays seawater droplets into marine clouds to make them reflect more sunlight . 
This augments the natural process , where sea salt from the oceans provides water vapor with the cloud condensation nuclei . 
It is remarkable to consider that we could cancel out this century &apos;s global warming with 1,900 unmanned ships spraying seawater mist into the air to thicken clouds . 
The total cost would be about $ 9 billion , and the benefits of preventing the temperature increase would add up to about $ 20 trillion . 
That is the equivalent of doing about $ 2000 worth of good with every dollar spent . 
Many of the risks of climate engineering have been overstated . 
Marine cloud whitening would not lead to permanent atmospheric changes , and could be used only when needed . 
Turning seawater into clouds is a natural process . 
The biggest challenge is public perception . 
Many environmental lobbyists oppose even researching climate engineering . 
This is startling , given the manifold benefits . 
If we care most about avoiding warmer temperatures , it seems that we should be elated that this simple , cost-effective approach shows so much promise . 
Climate engineering could remain a back-up option in case of necessity . 
Or we could put it on the agenda today . 
In either case , there is a commanding case for its serious consideration . 
We are on track to being the generation that wasted decades bickering over carbon-emission cuts and failed to stop the harmful effects of warming . 
That would be a shameful legacy - one that could be avoided by re-thinking climate policy .
