Families of the Future 
WASHINGTON , DC - It is graduation season in many countries , a time when classes of bright and fortunate young people don their caps and gowns , receive their diplomas , and hear advice from their elders . 
Some commencement speakers focus on the graduates &quot; accomplishments ; others emphasize the career-related challenges that lie ahead . 
But there is another critical aspect to success and happiness that is often overlooked during these garlanded celebrations of academic achievement : family . 
In fact , these ceremonies are about the graduates &quot; families - that is , those who have loved and supported them , regardless of their biological connection - as much as they are about the graduates themselves . 
Whatever each family &apos;s experience , the result has been a child reaching a level of education of which many people can only dream . 
Beyond noting and appreciating what their families have done for them , graduates must consider the kind of family that they want to nurture . 
And here they have no choice but to reflect on gender roles and relations . 
Given the vastly different expectations and experiences of men and women - depending , of course , on the cultural context - the questions that they must ask themselves vary considerably . 
The question of how to balance work and family , typically posed to young women , is actually a critical consideration for young men as well . 
The traditional male role as &quot; provider &quot; has often led work to take precedence over time spent with family . 
Indeed , in reflecting on their childhoods , many graduates may lament that their fathers spent too little time at home , or were less nurturing than they could have been . 
Men must determine how to develop the caring side of their personality , in addition to the competitive side that will enable them to advance their careers . 
They must aim to love and give fully , not only as fathers , but also as sons , husbands , brothers , uncles , and even friends . 
To this end , they should ask their own fathers and grandfathers what they wish they had done differently - and plan accordingly . 
Instead of waiting for challenges to arise , young men should begin establishing their priorities now . 
How can they ensure that their relationship with their future partner is equal ? 
How will they adapt to enable their partner to fulfill his or her career aspirations ? 
Will they be willing to move for their partner &apos;s job ? 
Would they be prepared to stop working or reduce their workload , in order to care for a child or parent ? 
Through all of this , men should remember that , by adopting a new approach , they are not abandoning their roles as providers . 
After all , providing care is every bit as important as providing cash . 
The reward is the close relationship with their children that women have traditionally enjoyed . 
Women , too , must think carefully about the future that they would find most fulfilling . 
For many women , the challenge is abandoning the assumption that their work / family balance will have to tip in favor of family , that it is they who will have to sacrifice their careers . 
Of course , many women might choose to emphasize family ( as would many men ) . 
The point is the choice : the choice of how much energy to devote to one &apos;s home , the choice of a career based on passion , and the choice of a genuinely equal partner . 
Upholding an equal partnership of caregivers and breadwinners will require compromises on both sides . 
A woman with great career ambitions should be able to find a partner who is willing to slow down or stop working to support her , just as a man should . 
But bucking gender roles works both ways . 
Indeed , for such a dynamic to work , the woman must recalibrate her expectations of her spouse . 
If she wants to build a family with a man , she must not become caught up in traditional perceptions of masculinity . 
If she is uncomfortable , say , out-earning her husband , she is limiting both partners . 
Simply put , the kind of support that young women &apos;s fathers and grandfathers probably offered to their mothers and grandmothers is not the only kind of support a woman can or should expect from her partner . 
Her role should be determined not by old-fashioned rules , but by her individual strengths and ambitions . 
And her partner should have the confidence and competence to encourage her to fulfill her potential . 
Finally , graduation does not mean that the family &apos;s job is complete . 
Parents and grandparents must continue to play a critical role in reshaping expectations - or at least supporting the choices that their children and grandchildren make . 
This means accepting the decision of a son or grandson not to use his hard-earned university degree to become the primary breadwinner in his future household . 
And it means understanding that what a daughter or granddaughter needs may not be a traditional &quot; provider , &quot; but a partner who makes career sacrifices to enable her to advance hers . 
Graduation is a day of ending and beginning . 
It is a day for young people to recall the sacrifices that their families have made for them , and consider the kinds of sacrifices they will make for their families . 
And it is a day to recognize that , if family comes first , work does not come second ; rather , life comes together .
