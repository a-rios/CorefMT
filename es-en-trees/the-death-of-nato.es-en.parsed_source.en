The Death of NATO 
LONDON - NATO , whose foreign ministers will meet next week , is dying . 
And , as NATO approaches its 60th birthday next spring , there seems no immediate urgency about writing its obituary ; 60-year-olds may reasonably look forward to another decade , perhaps two or even three , of active and productive life . 
But perhaps it is now time for some discreet reflection on the fact that &quot; the old man will not always be with us . &quot; 
Human institutions , like human beings , can collapse with surprising speed once they have outlived their usefulness . 
The dramatic dissolution of the Soviet Union stands as a reminder of what can happen to organizations when doubts take hold as to whether they still serve any real interests other than those of their own apparatchiks - and how suddenly such doubts can grow when they attempt to convert themselves into something they are not . 
NATO has , of course , shown remarkable tenacity . 
It should have disappeared when the Soviet Union collapsed and the Warsaw Pact evaporated ; its job was done . 
But then came the Balkans crises of the 1990s , culminating in the realization that only American military power could put a stop to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic &apos;s ethnic cleansing of Kosovo . 
And then came the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , making the &quot; out of area or out of business &quot; choice seem a no-brainer . 
So NATO remains in business , and in Afghanistan . 
But NATO &apos;s repeated demonstrations of resilience should not blind us to the fact that it no longer provides a healthy basis for the transatlantic security relationship . 
As long as NATO &apos;s raison d &quot; Ãªtre was to keep the Russians out and the United States in , NATO &apos;s internal dynamic of American leadership and European obeisance was both inevitable and appropriate . 
This unbalanced relationship still has advantages for both parties . 
Americans may find their ( old ) European allies less pliable than before - but they can at least count on the absence of any serious alternatives for what NATO should become , or what it should do . 
Europeans can continue to avoid responsibility for their own security , and to invoke the catechism of &quot; NATO , the corner-stone of our security &quot; as a substitute for serious strategic thought . 
But each now resents the behavior of the other . 
Americans find their patience tried by Europeans who are free with their advice and criticism yet reluctant to shoulder risks . 
Moreover , the US learned from the Kosovo experience of &quot; war by committee &quot; to distrust NATO as a place to run operations , and now Afghanistan highlights the organization &apos;s limitations as a mechanism for generating force contributions . 
As for Europeans , they are unhappy about pressure to participate in a US-led &quot; global war on terror &quot; that they regard as dangerous and misconceived , and to go along with policies seemingly designed to antagonize their more difficult neighbors like Russia and the Islamic world . 
So what is to be done ? 
None of the ideas for another dose of NATO rejuvenation looks like the answer . 
All the talk of an improved NATO-European Union partnership is mainly wasted breath . 
&quot; Intensified strategic dialogue in Brussels &quot; in practice boils down to the chilling specter of interminable joint committee meetings at which one nation &apos;s ambassador to NATO explains his government &apos;s position to a compatriot diplomat who is accredited to the EU , and vice-versa . 
The problem is not institutional relationships between the two organizations , except in the important but narrow case of Turkey and Cyprus , which remain bent on pursuing their bilateral feud without regard to the real risks to the personnel of their allies and partners deployed in Afghanistan and Kosovo . 
The real problem is relations between the US and European countries , 21 of which belong to both organizations . 
Nor does the answer lie in developing an EU &quot; caucus &quot; within NATO . 
The 1990 &quot; s concept of a &quot; European Defense Identity &quot; within NATO proved to be unviable - and since then expansion of the alliance and proliferation of NATO &quot; partners &quot; has made the idea of a special collective role for EU members all the more improbable . 
A double layer of decision-making would only cause an already ponderous organization to seize up . 
There is nothing more dramatic to be done than to focus on upgrading the EU-US strategic dialogue . 
The annual summits need to be made more substantial , and their focus shifted from transatlantic , bilateral issues to aligning EU and US global policies and actions . 
The US president should keep an eye on the calendar of the European Council , which brings the EU presidents and prime ministers together four times a year , and solicit an occasional invitation . 
The US mission to the EU should be scaled up , and EU representation in Washington turned into a proper embassy . 
The more seriously the Americans show that they are willing to take the EU collectively , the more seriously the Europeans will take themselves . 
Winston Churchill once remarked that you could always count on the Americans to do the right thing , after having tried all the alternatives . 
In the same way , the Europeans will eventually find themselves having to speak with one voice and act as one body in the wider world , if only because a globalized world will not allow them the luxury of doing anything else . 
As Charles de Gaulle forecast , &quot; It is not any European statesman who will unite Europe . 
Europe will be united by the Chinese . &quot; 
Only collectively can Europeans be effective contributors to global security , or achieve a robust transatlantic security partnership . 
As NATO enters its twilight years , the US should encourage the EU to grow into its global responsibilities . 
For , despite all their differences and mutual dissatisfactions , Europe and the US know that each is the best friend either is likely to have for the foreseeable future .
