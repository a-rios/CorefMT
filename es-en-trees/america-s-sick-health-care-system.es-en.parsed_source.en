America \ u0027s Sick Health Care System 
Alone among industrialized nations , the United States lacks a national health insurance system . 
Forty million Americans lack any form of health insurance ; many more face losing their job-linked coverage in company layoffs . 
Meanwhile , US annual spending for health care totals $ 4,600 per capita , over twice the average of other industrial countries . 
Health care expenditure totals a world-leading 14 % of GDP stands , for a grand total of $ 1.3 trillion - and rising . 
According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , despite this colossal spending , America lags behind Japan and several European countries in standard measures of health : infant mortality , life expectancy at birth , and deaths that could have been prevented by appropriate medical care . 
The US spends more and gets less , and all indications suggest that the perverse economics of American health care will continue more or less unchanged indefinitely . 
The reason is that the losers in this system tend to be poor , politically unorganized , and inarticulate , while their more fortunate fellow citizens are insured for the costs of treatment and reap the benefits of the high-tech excellence for which American medicine is renowned . 
Starting with the President , continuing through the ranks of Congress and the federal bureaucracy , and extending to the nation &apos;s many millions of steadily , safely employed executives and workers , ample health insurance is a guaranteed benefit . 
Also safely insured , under the federal Medicare program , are 40 million elderly and disabled citizens . 
From their personal experience , the system works well . 
The big bills incurred by expensive diagnostics and hospital stays are covered in large part or altogether . 
For the well insured , money is not a barrier to good care . 
The poor receive some coverage under the sparsely funded Medicaid program , jointly funded by Washington and the individual states . 
The not-so-poor population exists in a medical no-man &apos;s land , ineligible for public assistance but lacking the money to pay big bills . 
Many of the 40 million without insurance are employed , but at low-wage jobs and by companies that do not provide health insurance as a benefit . 
Some of the poor do manage to piece together the price of care , but the difficulties of doing so are becoming greater due to medical inflation , currently running at over twice the general rate of consumer inflation . 
Costs are being pushed higher by the arrival of new medical technologies , aggressive marketing of pharmaceuticals directly to consumers , and the public &apos;s high hopes for medical miracles . 
But many , although dubious or altogether worthless , easily become established in medical practice and produce a torrent of income for persuasive doctors serving well-insured patients . 
For example , surgery for arthritis of the knee fetches some $ 3 billion a year for doctors , but , according to a study conducted by the US Department of Veterans Affairs , it is therapeutically useless . 
Studies such as this are rare , because the doctors who profit from the practices being investigated do not welcome independent reviews that might demolish their trade . 
The federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , responsible for assessing the efficacy of medical treatments , has led a precarious existence under the gaze , and political contributions , of medical specialists . 
Attempts to bring economic rationality and equity to American medicine date back to immediately after World War II , when President Harry Truman &apos;s proposal for establishing a national health insurance system brought cries of &quot; socialized medicine &quot; and quick defeat in Congress . 
Richard Nixon instituted price controls to hold down soaring medical costs , but when the controls were lifted , prices took off . 
The most determined effort to remake the system arrived with the Clinton administration &apos;s proposal for a comprehensive national health insurance system jointly financed by employers and the federal government . 
Once again , the health-care sector , fearing a loss of money and autonomy , mobilized determined opposition . 
Ineptly presented to the public , the Clinton plan died in Congress . 
Into the ensuing vacuum came managed care , which was designed to hold down health-care spending by controlling access to treatment . 
So &quot; incrementalism &quot;  - a small fix here and there - became the basic strategy of health-care reform , leading , for example , to programs to provide care for poor children and a current proposal to help the needy pay for drugs . 
Costs were contained , but not so the outcries of aggrieved patients who felt they were denied adequate care and the late-night comics who conjured up scenarios of &quot; drive-by &quot; obstetrics and other pointed jokes . 
According to the latest estimates , health-insurance premiums will rise this year by 10-15 % , following similar increases in recent years . 
Corporate employers have responded by requiring employees to pay part of the insurance costs - which is , in effect , a pay cut . 
But this has done nothing to address the underlying problem - the continuing rapid rise in the cost of health care . 
Will America eventually emulate the rest of the industrialized world and provide health insurance for all ? 
Maybe , but not soon . 
In the words of a renowned health economist , Victor Fuchs of Stanford University , &quot; National health insurance will probably come to the United States after a major change in the political climate , the kind of change that often accompanies a war , a depression , or large-scale civil unrest . &quot;
