Erdoğan &apos;s Second Chance 
ISTANBUL - The outcome of Turkey &apos;s latest general election - voters have gone to the polls twice in the last five months - reveals important insights into the nature of the country &apos;s democracy and the preferences of its citizens . 
The first of Turkey &apos;s two parliamentary elections this year , in June , was widely viewed as a referendum on President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan &apos;s efforts to strengthen the powers of his office . 
The result was clear . 
Erdoğan &apos;s Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) received just 41 % of the vote , costing it the majority it had enjoyed since coming to power in 2002 . 
On November 1 , however , after negotiations following the June elections resulted in a hung parliament , Turks voted again , and the outcome could not have been more different . 
This time , the election was predominantly perceived as a referendum on the continuation of single-party rule , and the AKP won 49 % of the vote , providing it with a comfortable majority . 
In the run-up to the latest election , Erdoğan and the AKP emphasized the importance of the party &apos;s parliamentary majority for Turkey &apos;s political stability . 
The opposition countered with the argument that a coalition government would counter the country &apos;s deep political polarization , while helping to establish stronger checks and balances . 
The promise of stability proved to be the more resonant message . 
The political instability following June &apos;s inconclusive election had been compounded by a sharp decline in domestic and regional security . 
A renewed campaign of violence by the separatist Kurdistan Workers &quot; Party ( PKK ) and attacks by the Islamic State , including suicide bombings in Ankara that killed more than 100 people , created a backdrop that reinforced the AKP &apos;s message . 
The outcome of the vote attests to the ineffectiveness of Turkey &apos;s parliamentary opposition , which once again failed to make a dent in the AKP &apos;s popularity , almost as if they had set out to disprove the theory that electorates simply tire of long-serving governments . 
Instead the AKP obtained its landslide victory - a major achievement after 13 years of uninterrupted rule - by siphoning voters from its competitors . 
The party received nearly five million more votes than it did in June , corresponding to a 20 % increase in its popularity . 
Two opposition parties , the conservative Nationalist Movement Party ( MHP ) and the predominantly Kurdish Peoples &quot; Democratic Party ( HDP ) , together lost three million votes , while the center-left Republican People &apos;s Party ( CHP ) held its ground , finishing second with 25 % of the vote . 
Voters punished the nationalist MHP severely for its obstructionism following the June election , when it refused all offers to join a coalition government . 
With 12 % of the popular vote , compared to 16 % in June , the MHP lost almost half of its parliamentary seats . 
The HDP was handicapped by its inability to distance itself from the PKK , which a large section of the electorate regards as being responsible for the upsurge in domestic violence . 
Indeed , the HDP seemed at risk of failing to obtain the 10 % of the vote it would need to enter parliament , an outcome that would have provided the AKP with a majority large enough to amend the constitution on its own . 
In the end , HDP ended with 10.75 % of the vote , down from 13 % in the June elections , preventing Erdoğan from securing the compliant parliament he would need to establish an executive presidency . 
Nonetheless , Turkey &apos;s new government has been provided with a broad enough mandate to address some of the country &apos;s most difficult and imminent policy challenges - most notably the peace process with the Kurds . 
A previous effort had been suspended ahead of the election , as the PKK returned to violence and the AKP &apos;s leadership adopted increasingly nationalist and hawkish rhetoric . 
With the election over , however , there is hope that the new government will restart the negotiations . 
If successful , the talks would have a major impact not only domestically , but also on the ongoing fight against the Islamic State . 
The AKP &apos;s majority will also enable it to continue to recalibrate the country &apos;s foreign policy . 
Turkey &apos;s policies following the Arab Spring had led to a loss of influence and friends in the region ; but recently the country has begun to adapt its approach to the realities on the ground . 
For example , Turkey has lifted its objections to a role for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in negotiations to end the civil war in Syria . 
Similarly , a new commitment to the struggle against the Islamic State has eliminated a core point of friction with Turkey &apos;s Western partners . 
The main trap the new government must avoid is a return to a heavily paternalistic style of governance . 
The AKP should take comfort in its large majority and start to view minority views and even peaceful dissent more benignly , in a way that befits a country negotiating accession to the European Union . 
The lesson of the two elections is clear : Turkey &apos;s voters want a strong , stable government , but not one that runs roughshod over its opponents .
