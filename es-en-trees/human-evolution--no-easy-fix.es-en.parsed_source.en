Human Evolution : No Easy Fix 
MADISON -Humans are undeniably complex , and proud of it . 
No case , we believe , needs to be made for our biological superiority . 
Our biological functions are exquisitely regulated and resilient to external variations , owing to complicated webs of interactions . 
Unlike other species , we seem to be endowed with willpower and intellect , hence we are capable of modifying the environment to buffer the effects of our decreasing fitness . 
Be that as it may , we may be doomed as a species precisely because of the way in which our complexity arose . 
Paraphrasing the science writer Philip Ball , nature seems to have activated a time bomb , and our complexity is only a short-term fix . 
To grasp the nature of the problem , we need to examine how humans are made at the molecular level , and contrast our constitution with that of other species that we often call &quot; rudimentary , &quot; such as unicellular organisms . 
This analysis leads us to examine proteins - our cellular building blocks and the executors of biologicalfunctions - across vastly different species . 
Proteins with common ancestry belonging to different species , termed &quot; orthologs , &quot; offer solid ground for comparison . 
It has been generally recognized that the basic &quot; fold , &quot; or shape , of a protein must be conserved across species , because there is a tight correspondence between structure and function . 
Proteins that retain the same function across very different species - generally the case with orthologs - are expected to keep the same fold . 
But the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein chains in these orthologs can vary significantly . 
Sometimes the extent of sequence identity between two orthologs can be as low as 25-30 % , and yet their folds remain strikingly similar , attesting to the robustness of function to evolutionary change . 
This conservation of the protein fold across species makes the origin of our complexity even more puzzling , as it is well known that the number of human genes is deceptively small , merely one order of magnitude larger than that of , say , rice . 
If the structure of the proteins is conserved across species , where is our complexity coming from ? 
Better still , in what sense are we more complex ? 
Researchers have recently discovered subtle structural variations occurring in orthologs from species that diverged from each other billions of years ago . 
In these structures , something subtler than overall topology changes across orthologs . 
The structure in some seems &quot; looser &quot; than in others - less well packed , with surface regions that enable surrounding water to penetrate and disrupt the structure by interacting favorably with the protein backbone . 
These structural vulnerabilities are known as dehydrons . 
As we examine orthologs , the proteins become more degraded , or richer in dehydrons , in species with a lower effective population - a somewhat elusive indicator inversely related to the size and complexity of the organism and to the complexity of its reproductive pattern . 
Thus , humans ( or mammals ) have significantly smaller ( ten or more orders of magnitude ) populations than bacteria . 
The observation that structural degradation is a reflection of decreasing species population resonates in the field of evolution , because natural selection becomes more inefficient as the population gets smaller . 
Structural degradation is thus an indicator of the species &quot; exposure to random genetic drift : mildly deleterious mutations that would typically degrade the protein structure are more likely to be selected against in bacteria before they can become fixed in the entire population ( estimated in trillions of individuals ) , whereas such a mutation has a far better chance of prevailing in humans . 
A protein that is richer in dehydrons than its ortholog is more vulnerable to becoming disrupted by surrounding water . 
Precisely for this reason , it becomes more &quot; needy &quot; - that is , more reliant on binding partners to maintain its structural integrity . 
Furthermore , dehydrons are known to be sticky , so structurally degraded proteins are more likely to promote protein-protein associations than orthologs with lower dehydron content . 
Thus , protein-protein interactions , a hallmark of complexity , are actually promoted by randomdrift , the evolutionary force behind the protein degradation process . 
So , it seems , complexity is not really naturally selected , but instead arises as a short-term fix to the effects of selection inefficiency . 
At first reading , this assertion seems counterintuitive , but the root of the paradox is simply our dogmatic way of thinking , where complex traits are expected to be an outcome of natural selection . 
And where is nature &apos;s gambit taking us ? 
The proteins with the largest accumulation of structural defects are the prions , soluble proteins so poorly wrapped that they relinquish their functionally competent fold and form aberrant aggregates that may cause degenerative neuropathies . 
This extreme case of an &quot; aberrantly needy protein &quot; illustrates the high level of genetic risk to which we are exposed as a result of our small population . 
The prion is a &quot; fitness &quot; catastrophe that gives us clues as to where nature &apos;s gambit might lead humanity . 
Perhaps the long-term evolutionary cost of our complexity is too high , with our survival as a species ultimately depending on our ability to mitigate its fitness cost through increasingly arduous therapeutic solutions . 
Let &apos;s hope we pass the test .
