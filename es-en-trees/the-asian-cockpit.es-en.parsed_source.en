The Asian Cockpit 
LONDON - With the July terrorist attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul - which left 41 dead and the finger of suspicion pointing at the Pakistani intelligence services - the world was again reminded why the Indian sub-continent has eclipsed the Middle East as the world &apos;s flash-point . 
Both American presidential candidates , Barack Obama and John McCain , have made clear that they expect the Pakistani government to take action against militants , and that they would be willing to authorize strikes inside Pakistan . 
The story of Western failure in Afghanistan is now all too familiar , painfully illustrated , almost weekly , by the repatriation of fallen NATO soldiers . 
The optimism that followed the recent Pakistani elections has turned to concern as the government &apos;s negotiations with militants appear to have made a terrorist safe-haven safer and attacks against NATO forces in Afghanistan more frequent . 
Pakistan &apos;s military and intelligence services are sympathetic to an Islamic fundamentalist creed , militant groups affiliated with al Qaeda operate freely on its territory , and government infighting has made it difficult to establish civilian control over the military . 
In any case , the ability of the Pakistani military to deal with the current threat , let alone a widespread insurgency , is questionable , as is Western leverage on Pakistan &apos;s security forces . 
As a result , loss of control of parts of Pakistan to an increasingly capable alliance of militant groups is a serious near-term threat . 
If American policy has failed to deal with this growing problem , European policy has focused on technical assistance , with the European Union providing € 125 million in aid between 2002 and 2006 . 
Moreover , Europe is Pakistan &apos;s largest trading partner , accounting for 27.4 % of total exports and 17 % of imports . 
In 2005 alone , EU imports from Pakistan totaled € 3.4 billion . 
Yet , despite this , it is hard to escape the conclusion that the EU &apos;s role in Pakistan bears all the hallmarks of the pre-Maastricht polity that it no longer wants to be : technocratic , apolitical , and marginalized by the United States . 
This needs to change . 
The US , even under a new president , cannot succeed in the region without a united front with Europe . 
And Europe cannot hope to achieve its aims with technical programs alone . 
To create a framework for US-European cooperation , work needs to begin now . 
Several reports that will influence the McCain and Obama campaigns are already being written in Washington . 
But none of these will be able to chart a way forward for transatlantic cooperation . 
Moreover , they risk repeating the standard pattern of US-European cooperation : the US as the policy developer and Europe as the apolitical and hesitant money-spender . 
Genuine transatlantic cooperation will require that solutions be developed jointly , and that European leaders &quot; own &quot; the policy options . 
Otherwise , European governments will find it difficult to explain the need to step up efforts in the region , and the European Commission &apos;s technical programs will continue to define the EU &apos;s policy . 
To build the necessary unity and a political strategy , a European Baker-Hamilton-style commission is necessary . 
Such a commission , with senior European members , could examine the key issues in the region , visit all countries and players and develop a set of recommendations for a new transatlantic approach to begin in early January 2009 when a new U.S president is in place . 
And who better to launch this than Nicolas Sarkozy ? 
The French president has already played a crucial role in bridging the U.S / European divide on the Afghan mission and - after a successful donor &apos;s conference - has taken the help of the EU &apos;s rotating , six-month presidency . 
Ideally , such a commission should be independent , but endorsed by the French , German and British governments and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana , as well as , however tacitly , Senators McCain and Obama . 
Everyone knows of the dangers posed by instability on the Afghan-Pakistan border , in Pakistan and the region . 
In July , Pakistani and Indian soldiers waged a 12 hour gun battle across disputed border . 
Worse still , the rejection by Ireland of the Lisbon Treaty threatens to push the issue further back in the queue .
