Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s French Lessons 
France has chosen - and it has chosen decisively . 
The next French president will be Nicolas Sarkozy , elected with 53.1 % of the popular vote , with turnout , at 84.8 % , the highest since 1981 . 
This election is particularly rich in lessons . 
France was said to be to be a country mired in apathy and increasingly uninterested in politics . 
For the last 20 years , the number of citizens who registered to vote had been declining and the number of registered voters who stayed home had been increasing . 
Among those who voted , the number who cast their votes for the parties of the extreme right or the extreme left - that is , parties unsuited for government - was steadily rising . 
All this changed in the two rounds of this year &apos;s election . 
The first lesson , then , is that France is re-politicizing . 
With voter turnout beating all European records , France &apos;s new president will have unusually strong legitimacy . 
Second , and equally important , the extremist vote is weakening . 
Support for Jean-Marie Le Pen &apos;s quasi-fascist National Front fell from 18 % in 2002 to 10 % this time around , representing an important gain in democratic stabilization . 
Likewise , the extreme left , which together put up six presidential candidates , was politically annihilated . 
Only one Trotskyite candidate received more than 4 % of the vote , while the rest - including the French Communist party , which for more than 30 years received a stable 20 % of the vote - gained less than 2 % . 
It is the end of an adventure that was not at all good for France . 
The third key feature of the election was the emergence of a centrist constituency seeking to distinguish - indeed , separate - itself from the right . 
This is a critical development in France . 
The brave candidate of the new center , François Bayrou , managed to triple his support relative to 2002 , gaining 17 % of the vote , although this was not enough to place him in the second round . 
It was still too early in terms of the development of French political culture for the formation of an alliance between Bayrou and the Socialist candidate , Ségolène Royal - a proposal that I made before the elections . 
The absence of an agreement between Royal and Bayrou to back the first-round winner in the run-off with Sarkozy largely explains the ultimate defeat of both . 
But this is understandable . 
Historically , the Socialist Party has no tradition of coalition governments , much less of looking for coalition partners to its right . 
That day will come , but its arrival will require more time . 
The fourth lesson follows from Sarkozy &apos;s stance as a classical ultra-liberal . 
While he is very French in his upbringing and education - he does not speak English ! - he is nevertheless neither a Jacobin nor a Gaullist . 
Indeed , the Gaullist tradition ends with him . 
Sarkozy made public his disagreement with outgoing President Jacques Chirac about the French position against the American-led war in Iraq . 
President George W. Bush , who was the first to congratulate Sarkozy , has a new ally in Europe . 
Sarkozy believes in the efficiency of markets and will shy away from state intervention in the economy . 
He will thus contribute to a reconciliation of the hitherto nationalist French right and modern conservatism as it is practiced elsewhere . 
The fifth lesson may be the most serious . 
The French left , represented by the Socialists , has suffered its third consecutive defeat in a presidential election . 
Given the erosion of the right &apos;s power and Sarkozy &apos;s not very attractive personality , the road was wide open for the Socialists to win . 
The disastrous failure of the left has many causes . 
But the most important one , in my view , was the absence of a clear strategy on the part of the Socialists , who consistently refuse to make the choices that have gradually been accepted by international social democracy , embodied today in the Party of European Socialists . 
The international left has opted for a reformist course , including , where necessary , coalition governments with centrist partners . 
The reformist option fully accepts the internationalization of today &apos;s market economy . 
The French Socialist Party &apos;s lingering statism , ethnocentrism , and reluctance to accept coalitions with movements to its right reflects its violent and troubled history and the long intellectual domination of the French Communists . 
But these features constitute an obstacle to the Socialists &quot; becoming the party of government , and were reflected in their electoral program , which was full of uncertainty and indifferent with respect to Europe and the broader international context . 
The voters did not find it credible . 
This lesson is so evident that the French Socialist Party now faces a clear choice . 
Either it modernizes its program to come closer to international social democracy , or it enters a period of slow and prolonged decline . 
The Socialists now have no choice but to engage in a debate that is certain to be loud and contentious . 
But the outcome is far less clear .
