The Next Trade Breakthroughs 
STANFORD - Economic news is grim all around the world . 
This year &apos;s output growth has been disappointing , and the International Monetary Fund expects only a slight improvement in 2015 . 
Europe may be sliding back into recession , with even the once-robust German economy teetering on the brink . 
China is downshifting , and Brazil , Russia , and India are struggling to avoid a stall . 
So it is a pity that three important opportunities for growth from trade liberalization - the World Trade Organization &apos;s Doha Development Round , the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) in the Asia-Pacific region , and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) between the United States and Europe - are being neglected . 
If designed properly , all three have the potential to spur global growth . 
Through the reduction of tariffs and non-tariff barriers , the protection of intellectual property , and the harmonization of regulations , hundreds of billions of dollars of output - and millions of better-paying jobs - could be generated . 
This is the lesson of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , which celebrates its 20th birthday this year . 
In NAFTA at 20 , a book that I edited , policymakers and scholars explain how the landmark trade treaty exemplifies the benefits of trade liberalization - and why political leaders should pursue it . 
The elimination of tariffs among Canada , Mexico , and the US was innovative , risky , and controversial . 
NAFTA became a lightning rod for complaints about globalization , capitalism , and the decline of organized labor . 
Many claimed that the treaty would depress wages , destroy jobs , and ravage the agricultural industry in the US . 
Instead , NAFTA boosted all three signatories &quot; economies and became the template for hundreds of subsequent free-trade agreements . 
NAFTA helped open what former Mexican Trade Minister Jaime Serra Puche says had been &quot; a highly protectionist economy for five or six decades . &quot; 
US agricultural exports threatened some Mexican farmers , but others were able to boost their exports - and profits - to the US . 
Meanwhile , the country &apos;s consumers , especially the urban poor , benefited from lower food prices . 
According to Stephen Haber , my colleague at Stanford University &apos;s Hoover Institution , &quot; After , and to a considerable extent because of , NAFTA , the Mexican economy and political process became far more competitive . &quot; 
Canada also benefited . 
The country &apos;s firms and workers saw their productivity rise by 14 % , leading to what the University of Toronto economist Daniel Trefler estimates is the equivalent of a decade &apos;s improvement in living standards . 
&quot; Canada &amp; hellip ; is a much more modern economy today than it would have been , &quot; says the country &apos;s former finance minister , Michael Wilson . 
Meanwhile , Canada and Mexico have become the United States &quot; top two export markets , accounting for a combined $ 625 billion in 2013 , more than the next ten largest export markets combined . 
Prior to NAFTA , exports to Mexico roughly equaled those to the United Kingdom and about half of what was going to Japan . 
Moreover , this surge in trade has created myriad well-paying jobs . 
NAFTA produced something far different from the outsourcing its opponents predicted . 
Some 40 % of what the US imports from Mexico actually originates in the US . 
For China , by contrast , the share is just 4 % . 
&quot; We &apos;re not just selling things to each other , &quot; explains Serra Puche . 
&quot; Now , we &apos;re producing things jointly . &quot; 
According to Lorenzo Caliendo , an economist at the Yale School of Management , a surge in cross-border trade and increases in real ( inflation-adjusted ) wages in all three countries can be attributed to NAFTA - even once other factors , like the opening of China , the peso crisis , the dot-com bubble , and the Great Recession , are taken into account . 
In short , as former US Secretary of State George Shultz has noted , &quot; NAFTA has transformed the region . &quot; 
Today , NAFTA can continue to serve as a model for ongoing trade negotiations . 
A NAFTA 2.0 could focus on areas that were originally excluded , such as labor mobility and energy . 
The development of Canadian oil sands , the shale-energy revolution in the US , and the opening of Mexico &apos;s oil sector to foreign investment imply the biggest geopolitical shift since the collapse of communism . 
Moreover , the finalization of either the TPP or the TTIP could spur progress in the WTO &apos;s Doha Round . 
&quot; There is no question that a high quality major agreement today , as the NAFTA was in 1994 , could cause multilateralism to take a giant leap forward , &quot; says former US Trade Representative Carla A. Hills . 
Trade liberalization has been stalled for too long . 
Since the end of World War II , American presidents , Democrat and Republican alike , have promoted free trade as a key pillar of growth . 
John F. Kennedy launched what became the Kennedy Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , and Bill Clinton helped secure congressional passage of NAFTA and the Uruguay Round of trade talks , which had been initiated and negotiated under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan . 
President Barack Obama has promoted the TPP in Asia , but he only recently asked Congress for fast-track negotiating authority ( the ability to request an up-or-down congressional vote without amendments ) . 
Obama &apos;s request was rebuffed by the US Senate &apos;s Democratic majority leader , Harry Reid . 
The new Republican-controlled Senate should act quickly to approve it . 
&quot; There is no way we would have completed the NAFTA negotiation without fast track , &quot; according to Hills . 
Nobody will negotiate seriously with the US if Congress can cherry-pick amendments . Former US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor recalls Clinton &apos;s horse-trading with congressional Democrats to persuade them to join Republicans in passing NAFTA , overcoming both parties &quot; protectionist wings . 
Obama and the new Republican majority must now decide if they will follow in their predecessors &quot; footsteps and spark a new era of economic growth .
