Justice for Srebrenica &apos;s Dead 
THE HAGUE - In 1993 , atrocities committed against Slavic Muslims near the Bosnian silver-mining town of Srebrenica catalyzed demands to establish a tribunal to try political and military leaders accused of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia . 
The new United Nations tribunal that was formed - nearly five decades after the final judgments were rendered at Nuremberg and Tokyo - became the forerunner of ad hoc courts to prosecute perpetrators of Rwanda &apos;s genocide , Charles Taylor and his blood-diamond butchers in Sierra Leone , and the Khmer Rouge killers in Cambodia . 
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) also gave rise to the permanent International Criminal Court to try war criminals worldwide . 
Undeterred by the still-untested ICTY &apos;s reach , Serb soldiers finally overran Srebrenica itself - despite its status as a &quot; safe area &quot; under UN protection - 15 years ago , on July 11 , 1995 , and proceeded to expel the town &apos;s people and execute 7,600 captives . 
Out of this massacre , however , the tribunal and foreign-backed war-crimes courts in Bosnia and Serbia have delivered the international justice effort &apos;s most significant achievement to date . 
With no media fanfare and limited arrest and investigative powers , and despite the foreign-policy and military &quot; realists &quot; who dismiss international justice as a pipedream , these judicial institutions have brought justice to Srebrenica &apos;s dead and their survivors , and have demonstrated that justice can be delivered to victims in other conflict areas . 
It is an imperfect , unsatisfying justice , to be sure , but no more imperfect or unsatisfying than that dispensed by national courts . 
The ICTY ruled the Srebrenica massacre to be an act of genocide . 
The tribunal and the local courts imprisoned 13 of those who gave the orders , as well as 17 execution-squad members ; 11 more men , four of them leaders , are facing their reckoning . 
On trial now are Radovan Karadžić , the Bosnian Serb political leader , and Jovica Stanišić , the police minister in Slobodan Milošević &quot; s Serbia . 
Of course , the Bosnian Serb commander , Ratko Mladić remains a fugitive . 
Serbia recently surrendered Mladić &quot; s war-time diaries . 
The Srebrenica trials also yielded a soul-testing record of a crime whose gravity Serb political leaders , former UN officials , and others once shamefully denied . 
Thanks to the ICTY , anyone can read the transcripts of intercepted calls to deliver more &quot; packages &quot; to the killing fields . 
A Serb district president , Miroslav Deronjić , testified that Karadžić told him : &quot; Miroslav , those people there must be killed . &quot; 
We know when , where , and to whom Mladić issued the kill order . 
The tribunal &apos;s Web site has video of an execution . 
We know that a Serb truck driver rescued a boy who survived a firing squad and , crying for his father , crawled from a twisted scrum of bodies . 
We know that a Serb officer defied Mladić and refused to order his men to partake in mass murder . 
The ICTY is flawed , of course . 
Judges and attorneys have treated too many witnesses with condescension , as if the tribunal were doing them a favor . 
Judges have sentenced too many killers to absurdly lenient prison terms , diminishing any deterrent effect that the tribunal might generate . 
Prosecution officials also negligently incinerated personal effects of Srebrenica victims , as well as items discovered in Albania and other evidence , and then obfuscated to dodge a scandal . 
New rules and procedures , as well as better training , can minimize such failings . 
But without the ICTY , impunity would have reigned for the murderers of Srebrenica and of less-renowned scenes of war crimes . 
Karadžić would still be flogging love potions in Belgrade . 
The retired generals would be tanning beside the Adriatic . 
Overwhelming proof of Croatia &apos;s complicity with Serbia in the dismemberment of Bosnia - something the media have also ignored - would never have emerged . 
And , following this anniversary of the massacre , it is safe to say that , without international justice , all of Srebrenica &apos;s victims - including my brother-in-law &apos;s father , Huso Čelik , and the others who are still missing - would still be moldering anonymously in mass graves . 
Their loved ones would be waiting still to gather at the town &apos;s memorial cemetery , where , on this anniversary , they dropped to their knees , drew their hands over their eyes , and recited the funeral prayer to Allah for forgiveness of the living and the dead .
