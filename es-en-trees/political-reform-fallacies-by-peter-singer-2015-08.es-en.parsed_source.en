Bentham &apos;s Fallacies , Then and Now 
MELBOURNE - In 1809 , Jeremy Bentham , the founder of utilitarianism , set to work on The Book of Fallacies . 
His goal was to expose the fallacious arguments used to block reforms like the abolition of &quot; rotten boroughs &quot; - electorates with so few electors that a powerful lord or landowner could effectively select the member of parliament , while newer cities like Manchester remained unrepresented . 
Bentham collected examples of fallacies , often from parliamentary debates . 
By 1811 , he had sorted them into nearly 50 different types , with titles like &quot; Attack us , you attack Government , &quot; the &quot; No precedent argument , &quot; and the &quot; Good in theory , bad in practice &quot; fallacy . 
( One thing on which both Immanuel Kant and Bentham agree is that this last example is a fallacy : If something is bad in practice , there must be a flaw in the theory . ) 
Bentham was thus a pioneer of an area of science that has made considerable progress in recent years . 
He would have relished the work of psychologists showing that we have a confirmation bias ( we favor and remember information that supports , rather than contradicts , our beliefs ) ; that we systematically overestimate the accuracy of our beliefs ( the overconfidence effect ) ; and that we have a propensity to respond to the plight of a single identifiable individual rather than a large number of people about whom we have only statistical information . 
Bentham did not rush to publish his work . 
An abridged version appeared in French in 1816 , and in English in 1824 , but the complete work remained in manuscript form until its publication this year as part of an ongoing project , under the editorship of Philip Schofield of University College , London , to publish Bentham &apos;s collected works . 
Some of the fallacies Bentham identified still make frequent appearances , while others are less relevant . 
The &quot; wisdom of our ancestors &quot; fallacy has often been invoked in debates over same-sex marriage . 
Anyone familiar with political discussion in the United States will instantly recognize a more specific version that could be called the &quot; wisdom of the Founding Fathers &quot; fallacy . 
Another fallacy popular both in Bentham &apos;s day and in ours is what he characterized as &quot; What ? 
More jobs ? &quot; 
The &quot; fallacies &quot; that really challenge the modern reader , however , are those that characterize arguments that today are widely accepted even in the most educated and enlightened circles . 
One of these , Bentham says , in a jarring juxtaposition , &quot; may be termed Anarchy-preacher &apos;s fallacy - or The Rights of Man fallacy . &quot; 
When people argue against a proposed measure on the grounds that it violates &quot; the rights of man &quot; - or , as we would say today , human rights - they are , Bentham claims , using vague generalities that distract us from assessing the measure &apos;s utility . 
Bentham accepts that it may be to the advantage of the community that the law should confer certain rights on people . 
What threatens to bring us closer to anarchy , he argues , is the idea that I have certain rights already , independent of the law . 
Whereas the principle of utility calls for inquiry and argument , Bentham believes that those who advocate such pre-existing rights disdain both and are more likely to stir people up to use force . 
Bentham &apos;s objection to &quot; natural rights &quot; is often cited . 
Less frequently discussed is what he calls &quot; the Posterity-chainer &apos;s device . &quot; 
One example is the Act of Union between England and Scotland , which requires all succeeding sovereigns of the United Kingdom to take an oath to maintain the Church of Scotland and the Church of England . 
If future generations feel themselves bound by such provisions , they are , Bentham thinks , enslaved by long-dead tyrants . 
Bentham &apos;s objection to such attempts to bind posterity applies not only to the union that created the UK , but also the one that formed the US : Why should the current generation consider itself bound by what was decided hundreds of years earlier ? 
Unlike the framers of the US Constitution , we have had centuries of experience to judge whether it does or does not &quot; promote the general welfare . &quot; 
If it does , we have all the reason we need to retain it ; but if it does not , don &apos;t we have as much power and as much right to change the arrangements under which we are governed as the framers had to prescribe them in the first place ? 
If we do , why should provisions that make the constitution so difficult to amend bind a majority of the electorate ? 
In the case of the unification of two or more previously sovereign states , Bentham is sensitive to the problem of providing assurances to the smaller states that the larger ones will not dominate them . 
Given what he takes to be the impossibility of tying future generations &quot; hands , he places his trust in the belief that sooner or later , after having been under one government , &quot; the two communities will have become melted into one . &quot; 
Public support for independence in Scotland and Catalonia shows that this is not always the case . 
Bentham , of course , would have accepted that he might be mistaken . 
After all , the &quot; Authority-worshipper &apos;s argument &quot; was another of the fallacies he rejected .
