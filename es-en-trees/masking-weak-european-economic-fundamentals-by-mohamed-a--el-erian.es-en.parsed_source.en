Europe &apos;s Fake Normal 
NEWPORT BEACH - August is traditionally Europe &apos;s holiday month , with many government officials taking several weeks off . 
In the process , important initiatives are put on hold until the &quot; great return &quot; at the beginning of September . 
This year , there is another reason why Europe has pressed the pause button for August . 
With a looming election in Germany , few wish to undermine Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s likely victory . 
After all , Germany is central to Europe &apos;s well-being , and Merkel &apos;s steady hand has allowed the continent to overcome a series of challenges over the last few years . 
As a result , many are eager to postpone any controversial policy decisions rather than rock the German political boat . 
Some of the recent economic news has seemed to justify this approach . 
At the end of July , the widely watched indicator of European manufacturing activity crossed the threshold signaling expansion for only the second time in 23 months . 
Adding to the sense of comforting normality , several European officials have taken to the airwaves with optimistic pronouncements . 
Whereas the euro and the eurozone were &quot; under threat just nine months ago , &quot; European Council President Herman Van Rompuy recently declared , &quot; this isn &apos;t the case anymore . &quot; 
All of this has underpinned a much-welcome calm in financial markets . 
Sovereign interest-rate spreads have been well-behaved , the euro has strengthened , and equity markets have risen robustly . 
Yet no one should be fooled . 
This summer &apos;s sense of normality is neither natural nor necessarily tenable in the long term . 
It is the result of temporary and - if Europe is not attentive - potentially reversible factors . 
If officials do not return quickly to addressing economic challenges in a more comprehensive manner , the current calm may give way to renewed turmoil . 
The task for Europe is not just a matter of restarting and completing the economic and political initiatives , whether regional or domestic , that have been put on hold until after the German election . 
In fact , these top-down decisions , while admittedly complex and certainly consequential , may be the least of Europe &apos;s challenges . 
Europe must also counter and reverse micro-level challenges that are becoming more deeply embedded in its economic and financial structure . 
Each day that passes complicates the design and implementation of lasting solutions to four problems in particular . 
First , joblessness continues to spread . 
The overall unemployment rate ( 12 % ) has yet to peak , led by an alarming lack of jobs among the young ( 24 % joblessness in the eurozone as a whole , with highs of 59 % and 56 % in Greece and Spain , respectively ) . 
Second , adjustment fatigue is widespread and becoming more acute . 
Long-struggling European citizens - especially the long-term unemployed - have yet to gain any sustained benefit from the austerity measures to which they have been subjected . 
And the result is not just general disappointment and worrisome social unrest . 
In the last few weeks , political stability in Greece and Portugal has been threatened as governments struggle with declining credibility and a rising popular backlash . 
Third , bailout fatigue is apparent . 
Citizens in the stronger European economies are increasingly unwilling to provide financial support to their struggling neighbors ; and their elected representatives will find it hard to ignore growing resentment of repeated diversion of national tax revenues , which has yielded only disappointing outcomes . 
Meanwhile , high levels of past exposure and weakening creditor coordination are undermining the availability of external funding , including from the International Monetary Fund . 
Finally , little oxygen is flowing to the private sector . 
While Europe has succeeded in stabilizing its sovereign-bond markets , financial intermediation for small and medium-size enterprises remains highly disrupted . 
With most credit pipelines already partly blocked , the shortage of corporate credit will become more severe as regulators finally force banks to embark on a proper mobilization of prudential capital and shrink balance sheets to less risky levels . 
All of this adds up to a sad reality for Europe . 
Despite hopeful blips in an economic indicator here and there , too many countries lack both immediate growth and longer-term growth engines . 
As a result , debt overhangs will remain problematic . 
Owners of private capital that could be allocated to productive investment will remain hesitant . 
And societies will continue to lack the jobs and capital investment that are essential for durable prosperity and general well-being . 
Europe &apos;s external environment is not helping , either . 
On the demand side , the ongoing economic slowdown in China is starting to affect companies &quot; orders and revenues , adding to the challenges stemming from the persistently sluggish US economy . 
These developments point to a much larger phenomenon : because of delayed awareness of the complex challenges ( and the related slow and partial policy responses ) facing much of the West , the low-equilibrium growth pattern that has prevailed in recent years ( what has been called the &quot; new normal &quot; ) is becoming less stable . 
And Europe is a leading indicator of this . 
In essence , Europe ( and the West more generally ) owes its recent tranquility to a series of experimental measures by central banks to offset the troubling combination of too little demand to generate sufficient job creation , inadequate structural reforms to revamp growth engines , debt overhangs that undermine productive investment , and insufficient policy coordination . 
Consequently , the resulting surface calm masks still-worrisome economic and financial fundamentals . 
Let us hope that European policymakers return well rested from their August break . 
They will need all the energy and dedication they can muster to pivot quickly from Europe &apos;s forced normality to a more durable strategy for recovery , or at least to stop drivers of renewed prosperity from slipping farther away before they can be harnessed .
