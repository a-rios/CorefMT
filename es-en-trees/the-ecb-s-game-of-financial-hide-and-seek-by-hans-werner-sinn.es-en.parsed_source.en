Saving Europe &apos;s Real Hegemon 
MUNICH - Last June , the European Commission announced its about-face on bank restructuring . 
The money for recapitalizing distressed banks would now come primarily from creditors , not European taxpayers , with a pecking order to specify which lenders would be repaid first . 
All of this is welcome , at least in principle . 
In practice , however , the scheme leaves much to be desired . 
The problem is that a very long list of exceptions reduces the recoverable assets to such an extent that in many cases it will still be impossible to make do without public money . 
The long-term plan is that this money should come from a fund created by European banks themselves . 
But the Eurogroup ( a meeting of eurozone finance ministers attended by the European Union &apos;s economic and monetary affairs commissioner and the European Central Bank president ) is suggesting that , until then , the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) - and thus the taxpayers - will fill the gap . 
Given that taxpayers are thus supposed to finance guarantees for deposits up to € 100,000 ( $ 133,000 ) - the median level of Dutch household wealth and twice the German median - the Eurogroup &apos;s proposal boils down to a massive redistribution of wealth in Europe , the dimensions of which are not understood by the public . 
The idea of exempting banks &quot; secured debt from the pecking order for repayment is extremely problematic as well . 
While this proposal may sound harmless and almost self-evident , it is not ; secured debt needs no further protection , because it is already secured . 
Viewed from this perspective , the additional protection afforded by the exemption is highly surprising . 
The exemption for secured debt undoubtedly concerns mainly the refinancing loans that the ECB has extended to commercial banks against increasingly weak collateral . 
For the eurozone &apos;s crisis-ridden economies ( Cyprus , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Portugal , and Spain ) , the combined total is € 732 billion . 
These loans extend far beyond providing the liquidity that these countries need for internal circulation , for which a maximum of € 335 billion - their available stock of central-bank money - would have sufficed . 
Instead , by weakening safety standards , bailing out foreign investors , and financing current-account deficits , the ECB has undercut and replaced the private European interbank market . 
With several banks in the crisis countries on the verge of bankruptcy , many of these loans have now turned toxic . 
After all , if one takes the average of estimates reported by reputable sources , the write-off losses of the six crisis countries &quot; banks amount to about € 670 billion . 
Participating in these write-offs would put huge strain on the Eurosystem ( the ECB and the central banks of the eurozone member states ) , which has only around € 500 billion in equity capital . 
The riskiness of the ECB &apos;s strategy of using the printing press to bail out banks , including their public and private clients , would become apparent to everyone . 
Thus , it is clear how the losses incurred by the ECB &apos;s de facto regional fiscal policy are to be avoided : the write-off costs will be transferred from the ECB to the ESM . 
This makes no difference to taxpayers , who will have to pay for both institutions &quot; losses in the same manner . 
But it has the advantage of allowing the ECB to present itself as having a clean balance sheet , thereby enabling it to maintain its current policy . 
Ultimately , this is merely a new round of the eurozone &apos;s old game of financial hide-and-seek , whereby losses are obscured by distributing them among different institutions and time horizons . 
The game started with the bailout fund for Greece , which was followed by the European Financial Stability Facility , the European Financial Stability Mechanism , and the International Monetary Fund , which in turn were relieved by the ESM . 
In each case , a major objective was to reduce the burden on the ECB , which had advanced the money by printing it and would have run into serious difficulties without help . 
The entire arrangement is highly problematic from the standpoint of democracy , because the initial decisions about undercutting the capital markets by means of public credit were taken by the ECB &apos;s Governing Council , in which large countries like France or Germany have the same voting power as Cyprus or Malta . 
Indeed , the national central banks &quot; allocation of emergency liquidity assistance required approval by only one-third of the Governing Council &apos;s members , and the six crisis countries had these votes . 
According to the Eurogroup &apos;s proposal , these self-awarded loans , too , are now to be secured by ESM funds . 
While the European Union &apos;s national parliaments must still decide on the scheme , they essentially have no option but to assent , because to do otherwise would severely harm the ECB . 
When they finally get to vote on the matter - years after the ECB &apos;s risky credit maneuvers - they will have no choice but to bail out the ECB , the true hegemon of the eurozone .
