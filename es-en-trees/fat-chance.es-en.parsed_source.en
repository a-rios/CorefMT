Fat Chance 
ATLANTA - We are , supposedly , in the midst of an obesity epidemic . 
Everyone is getting fatter . 
Children are fatter than their parents . 
Epidemics caused by fat are now manifest : Type 2 diabetes , increased rates of heart and cardiovascular disease , and notably more cancers , such as breast cancer . 
This &quot; globesity &quot; epidemic is seen in poor countries as well as in wealthy ones . 
But are people really so unhealthily fat ? 
Certainly there are morbidly obese people , whose weight puts their lives at risk . 
Consider the British jailer Daniel Lambert ( 1770-1809 ) , who stood 5 &quot; 1 &quot; ( 155 centimeters ) tall and weighed 739 lbs ( 335 kilos ) , yet neither drank nor ate &quot; more than one dish at a meal . &quot; 
At his death , Lambert was remembered as a man of great &quot; temperance . &quot; 
In other words , he was deemed to be healthy and happy . 
The problem today seems to be that we have demonized &quot; fat , &quot; even among people who are labeled &quot; overweight &quot; rather that &quot; obese . &quot; 
Indeed , we have lowered the boundary for &quot; overweight &quot; to include people considered &quot; normal &quot; a generation ago . 
And we have deemed fat the major public health risk in our world and fat people the cause of a range of social problems , from placing stress on health-care systems to posing a risk to their own families . 
Several causes of - some of them contradictory - obesity have been identified . 
Some point to a shift in the &quot; quality of life &quot; : we live longer , have less physically stressful occupations , and have easier access to more food . 
Moreover , we have abundant access to &quot; bad &quot; or &quot; fast &quot; cheap food and an absence of opportunities for physical activity in areas of extreme poverty : this is the &quot; obesity of poverty &quot; argument - that is , poverty is a contributory factor in morbid weight gain . 
Others argue that our individual psychological makeup is at fault : we depend on food as a means of manipulating our environment . 
On this assumption , obesity is simply on a continuum of eating disorders with anorexia nervosa , which has been defined as a mental illness . 
But eating too much food is also an addiction , which nowadays is likewise usually understood in medical terms - as a genetic pathological predisposition in an individual or group . 
Then again , obesity is sometimes viewed as a genetically predetermined &quot; normal &quot; predisposition , understood in terms of an evolutionary biological drive to accumulate body fat in order to prevent starvation in times of famine . 
This is the &quot; ob-gen &quot; argument , first put forth in a 1994 paper by Yiying Zhang and her colleagues on the genetics of obesity in mice , which concluded by extrapolating their findings to human beings . 
Being obese can also be caused by disruption of normal growth caused by pathological changes - ranging from tumors to aging ( which is also understood as pathological ) - in the endocrine system . 
The older we become , the fatter we get , no matter what we eat - though this seems to conflict with the ob-gen argument that we need to get fat to avoid starvation . 
On this view , an aging population means a fatter population in the United States , China , Japan , and much of Europe . 
Finally , obesity can be the result of infection by an agent that makes us get fat . 
Today , this agent is the adenovirus 36 ( Ad-36 ) , which stimulates the growth and reproduction of fat cells , as well as causing immature fat cells to mature more quickly , at least in chickens . 
Of course , in a &quot; real &quot; human being any number of these causes - social , psychological , or genetic - may be at work . 
But all define the obese as an object for intervention . 
The model in public health is smoking , though the list of overlapping and contradictory causes implies greater deference to factors beyond our control . 
As St. Augustine put it : &quot; In the midst of these temptations I struggle daily against greed for food and drink . 
This is not an evil which I can decide once and for all to repudiate and never to embrace again , as I was able to do with fornication . &quot; 
So , are we getting too fat ? 
What does &quot; too fat &quot; mean in terms of individual happiness and health ? 
Why are we ( if , indeed , we are ) getting fatter ? 
If there is a public health question here , it may well be a series of problems rooted in a faulty assumption : the growth of girth and its absolute relationship to ill health . 
This is not to say that there are no health problems associated with fat , but we have created a moral panic about the impact of increased weight on society , on the family , and on our happiness . 
To see a world-wide epidemic of fat caused by a conspiracy of fast-food producers and our genes strikes one as weird : but the dieting culture relies on the sense that we must control this epidemic . 
Each age , culture , and tradition defines what is an unacceptable body weight - unhealthy , ugly , or corrupt . 
We must understand this as a process of creating ideal or normal bodies - those bodies that we desire to inhabit , but almost certainly will not .
