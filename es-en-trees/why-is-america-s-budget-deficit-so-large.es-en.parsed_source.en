Why is America &apos;s Budget Deficit So Large ? 
CAMBRIDGE - America &apos;s enormous budget deficit is now exceeded as a share of national income only by Greece and Egypt among all of the world &apos;s major countries . 
To be sure , the current deficit of 9.1 % of GDP is due in part to the automatic effects of the recession . 
But , according to the official projections of the United States Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , even after the economy returns to full employment , the deficit will remain so large that America &apos;s national debt-to-GDP ratio will continue to rise for the rest of this decade and beyond . 
Understanding how to achieve US fiscal consolidation requires understanding why the budget deficit is projected to remain so high . 
Before looking at the projected future deficits , consider what happened in the first two years of President Barack Obama &apos;s administration that caused the deficit to rise from 3.2 % of GDP in 2008 to 8.9 % of GDP in 2010 ( which in turn pushed up the national debt-to-GDP ratio from 40 % to 62 % ) . 
The 5.7 % -of-GDP rise in the budget deficit reflected a 2.6 % -of-GDP fall in tax revenues ( from 17.5 % to 14.9 % of GDP ) and 3.1 % -of-GDP rise in outlays ( from 20.7 % to 23.8 % of GDP ) . 
According to the CBO , less than half of the 5.7 % -of-GDP increase in the budget deficit was the result of the economic downturn , as the automatic stabilizers added 2.5 % of GDP to the rise in the deficit between 2008 and 2010 . 
The CBO analysis calls the changes in the budget deficit induced by cyclical conditions &quot; automatic stabilizers , &quot; on the theory that the revenue decline and expenditure increase ( mainly for unemployment benefits and other transfer payments ) caused by an economic downturn contribute to aggregate demand and thus help to stabilize the economy . 
In other words , even without the automatic stabilizers - that is , if the economy had been at full employment in 2008-2010 - the US budget deficit still would have increased by 3.2 % of GDP . 
Lower revenue and increased outlays each account for about half of this &quot; full-employment &quot; rise in the deficit . 
Looking ahead , the CBO projects that enacting the budget proposed by the Obama administration in February would add $ 3.8 trillion to the national debt between 2010 and 2020 , causing the debt-to-GDP ratio to soar from 62 % to 90 % . 
That $ 3.8 trillion net debt increase reflects a roughly $ 5 trillion increase in the deficit , owing to higher spending and weaker revenues from middle- and lower-income taxpayers , offset in part by $ 1.3 trillion in tax increases , primarily on high-income earners . 
Even this enormous increase in the projected deficits and debt underestimates the fiscal damage that the Obama administration &apos;s budget , if enacted , would inflict . 
The proposed budget assumes that non-defense &quot; discretionary &quot; spending ( which requires congressional approval , unlike so-called &quot; mandatory &quot; spending like Social Security pension benefits , which continues to grow unless Congress changes the benefits ) will rise by a total of only 5 % in the decade 2010-2020 , implying a decline in real terms and no scope for new programs . 
The annual level of defense spending is projected to decline by about $ 50 billion in each year after 2012 - a very optimistic view of US military needs in the decade ahead . 
Shrinking America &apos;s budget deficit to prevent a further rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio from its current level will require reduced spending and increased revenue . 
That increase in revenue can be achieved without raising marginal tax rates , namely by limiting the amount of tax reduction that individuals and businesses can achieve from the various &quot; tax expenditures &quot; that form an important part of the US tax code . 
But that is a subject for another column . 
On the expenditure side , however , the prospect that the national debt could double during the next decade is just the start of the fiscal problem that the US now faces . 
The budget outlook in subsequent decades is dominated by the increasing costs of Social Security and Medicare benefits , which are projected to take the debt-to-GDP ratio from 90 % in 2020 to 190 % in 2035 . 
Fundamental reform of these programs is the primary challenge for America &apos;s public finances - and thus for the long-term health of the US economy .
