Networked Leaders 
CAMBRIDGE - In an environment of mobile phones , computers , and Web sites such as MySpace , Facebook , and LinkedIn , it is commonplace to say that we live in a networked world . 
Barack Obama understands this ; indeed , it helped to secure his victory . 
While Obama was hardly the first American politician to use the Internet , he was the most effective in using new technology to raise money from small donors , energize and coordinate volunteers , and convey his messages directly to voters . 
Now he is faced with the question of how to use networks to govern . 
Networks come in many shapes and sizes . 
Some create strong ties , while others produce weak ties . 
Think of the difference between friendships and acquaintances . 
Valuable information is more likely to be shared by friends than among acquaintances . 
Networks based on strong ties produce the power of loyalty , but may become cliques that re-circulate conventional wisdom . 
They may succumb to &quot; group think . &quot; 
That is why the diversity in Obama &apos;s cabinet choices is important . 
He has been compared to Abraham Lincoln in his willingness to include rivals as well as friends on his team . 
Weak ties , such as one finds on the Internet , are more effective than strong ties for providing the necessary information to link diverse groups together in a cooperative manner . 
In other words , weak networks are part of the glue that holds diverse societies together . 
They are also ï¿½ the basis of democratic leadership . 
The greatest democratic politicians have a large capacity for shallow friendships . 
As leaders increasingly need to understand the relationship of networks to power , they will have to adapt strategies and create teams that benefit from both strong and weak ties . 
Information creates power , and more people have more information today than at any time in human history . 
Technology &quot; democratizes &quot; social and political processes and , for better and worse , institutions play less of a mediating role . 
In fact , the basic concept that is sometimes called &quot; Web 2.0 &quot; rests on the idea of user-based content bubbling up from below rather than descending from the top of a traditional information hierarchy . 
Institutions like Wikipedia and Linux are examples of social production that involve very different roles for leaders than do their traditional counterparts , Encyclopedia Britannica and Microsoft . 
Now governments are experimenting with similar means to create and distribute information , but they still have a long way to go . 
Governments have traditionally been very hierarchical , but the information revolution is affecting the structure of organizations . 
Hierarchies are becoming flatter and embedded in fluid networks of contacts . 
White-collar knowledge workers respond to different incentives and political appeals than do blue-collar industrial workers . 
Polls show that people today are less deferential to authority in organizations and politics . 
In business , too , networks are becoming more important . 
In some cases , one can orchestrate a complex network simply with carefully specified contracts . 
In describing the success of the Toyota and Linux networks , the Boston Consulting Group concludes that the hard power of monetary carrots and accountability sticks motivates people to perform narrow , specified tasks , but that the soft power of admiration and applause are far more effective stimulants of extraordinary behavior . 
Traditional business leadership styles have become less effective . 
According to Sam Palmisano , the CEO of IBM , hierarchical , command-and-control approaches simply do not work anymore . 
They impede information flows inside companies , hampering the fluid and collaborative nature of work today . 
A study of a major &quot; bricks and clicks &quot; company ( one that combines offline and online operations ) found that distributed leadership was essential . 
In the Internet environment , the traditional view of a leader being decisively in control is difficult to reconcile with reality . 
Instead , effective leadership depends on the use of multiple leaders for capable decision-making . 
Harvard Business School professor John Quelch writes that &quot; business success increasingly depends on the subtleties of soft power . &quot; 
Former President George W. Bush called himself &quot; the decider , &quot; but leadership today is more collaborative and integrative than that implies . 
One management expert summarizes recent studies as describing an increase in the use of more participative processes . 
In other words , the Internet age requires new styles of leadership in which attractive soft power must supplement the traditional hard power of command . 
In a networked world , leadership is more like being in the middle of the circle and attracting others than being &quot; king of the mountain &quot; and issuing orders to subordinates down below . 
Barack Obama understands this networked dimension of leadership and the importance of the soft power of attraction . 
Not only did he successfully use networks in his campaign ; he has continued to use the Internet to reach out to citizens . 
He has supplemented his major television and radio speeches with Internet-based video clips on YouTube , and his political style has been marked by reaching out in a bipartisan fashion to broad circles of political leaders . 
While it is still too early in his presidency to judge the outcome , it is clear that he is attempting to change processes and adapt leadership to a more networked world .
