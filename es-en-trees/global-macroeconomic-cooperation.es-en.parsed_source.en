Global Macroeconomic Cooperation 
NEW YORK - The world has yet to achieve the macroeconomic policy coordination that will be needed to restore economic growth following the Great Crash of 2008 . 
In much of the world , consumers are now cutting their spending in response to a fall in their wealth and a fear of unemployment . 
The overwhelming force behind the current collapse of jobs , output , and trade flows , is even more important than the financial panic that followed Lehman Brothers &quot; default in September 2008 . 
There is , of course , no return to the situation that preceded the Great Crash . 
The worldwide financial bubble cannot and should not be recreated . 
But if the world cooperates effectively , the decline in consumer demand can be offset by a valuable increase in investment spending to address the most critical needs on the planet : sustainable energy , safe water and sanitation , a reduction of pollution , improved public health , and increased food production for the poor . 
The United States , Europe , and Asia have all experienced a collapse of wealth due to the fall of stock markets and housing prices . 
There is not yet an authoritative measurement of the wealth decline and of how it is distributed worldwide , but it is probably around $ 15 trillion lower than the peak in the US , and perhaps $ 10 trillion lower in both Europe and Asia . 
A combined wealth decline of around $ 25 trillion would be roughly 60 % of one year &apos;s global income . 
The decline in US wealth as a share of the US economy is even larger , around 100 % of annual income , and perhaps 70 % of annual income in Europe and Asia . 
The usual assumption is that household consumption falls by around $ 0.05 for each $ 1 decline in household wealth . 
This would mean a direct negative shock to household spending in the US of around 5 % of national income , and of around 3.5 % in Europe and Asia . 
The size of this downturn is so large that unemployment will rise sharply in all major regions of the world economy , perhaps reaching 9-10 % in the US . 
Households will gradually save enough to restore their wealth , and household consumption will gradually recover as well . 
Yet this will occur too slowly to prevent a rapid rise in unemployment and a massive shortfall of production relative to potential output . 
One powerful way to boost the world economy and to help meet future needs is to increase spending on key infrastructure projects , mainly directed at transportation ( roads , ports , rail , and mass transit ) , sustainable energy ( wind , solar , geothermal , carbon-capture and sequestration , and long-distance power transmission grids ) , pollution control , and water and sanitation . 
There is a strong case for global cooperation to increase these public investments in the developing economies , and especially in the world &apos;s poorest regions . 
These regions , including Sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia , are suffering harshly from the global crisis , owing to falling export earnings , remittances , and capital inflows . 
Poor regions are also suffering from climate changes such as more frequent droughts , caused by rich countries &quot; greenhouse-gas emissions . 
At the same time , impoverished countries have huge needs for infrastructure , especially roads , rail , renewable energy , water and sanitation , and for improved current delivery of vital life-saving services , including health care and support for food production . 
The G-20 , which comprises the world &apos;s largest economies , offers the natural setting for global policy coordination . 
The next G-20 meeting in London in early April is a crucial opportunity for timely action . 
The leading economies - especially the US , European Union , and Japan - should establish new programs to finance infrastructure investments in low-income countries . 
The new lending should be at least $ 100 billion per year , directed towards developing countries . 
The new financing would include direct loans from rich countries &quot; export-credit agencies to enable poor countries to borrow long term ( for example , 40 years ) to build roads , power grids , renewable energy generation , ports , fiber optic networks , and water and sanitation systems . 
The G-20 should also increase the lending capacity of the World Bank , the African Development Bank , and other international financial institutions . 
Japan , with a surplus of saving , a strong currency , massive foreign exchange reserves , and factories without domestic orders , should take the lead in providing this funding for infrastructure . 
Moreover , Japan can boost its own economy and those of the poorest countries by directing its own industrial production to the infrastructure needs of the developing world . 
Cooperation can turn the sharp and frightening decline in worldwide consumption spending into a global opportunity to invest more in the world &apos;s future well being . 
By directing resources away from rich countries &quot; consumption to developing countries &quot; investment needs , the world can achieve a &quot; triple &quot; victory . 
Higher investment and social spending in poor countries will stimulate the entire world economy , spur economic development , and promote environmental sustainability through investments in renewable energy , efficient water use , and sustainable agriculture .
