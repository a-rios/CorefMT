Revolutionary Patience 
MADRID - On December 17 , 2010 , Mohamed Bouazizi set himself alight in Sidi Bouzid , Tunisia . 
Within weeks , the popular revolt triggered by Bouazizi &apos;s act had spread far beyond Tunisia , engulfing much of the Arab world . 
In Europe , Ukraine and other troubled countries , such as Bosnia , began their long and still incomplete transitions to democracy a quarter-century ago . 
The Arab world , by contrast , has logged a mere three years of transition - the blink of an eye in historical terms . 
Still , there have already been significant changes , and the region is advancing - though the destination remains unknown . 
As in other parts of the world , Arab countries need time to attain the democracy and pluralism their peoples seek . 
They will achieve their goals - but not in a mere three years . 
In fact , events in today &apos;s Middle East continue to be shaped by the radical changes brought about after World War I. Previously , most Arabs had been grouped together under various caliphates . 
After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in 1923 , two nation-states ( Iran and Turkey ) emerged , while the Arabs were distributed among 22 new countries , generally under British or French colonial domination . 
Once the colonies had achieved independence - Saudi Arabia , today a Sunni regional power , was created in 1932 - a new attempt was made to unite the Arab nation by means of the political Islam that emerged in the 1920 &quot; s in response to the fall of the Ottoman Caliphate . 
The phenomenon took many forms , including the Muslim Brotherhood , founded in 1928 . 
At the same time , efforts at nation-building along secular lines were reflected in Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser &apos;s pan-Arabism and the Syrian Baath Party , resulting in the establishment of the United Arab Republic , a union between Egypt and Syria that lasted from 1958 to 1961 . 
A half-century later , the simultaneous revolts in the Arab world were the result of neither political tendency , instead reflecting broad popular rejection of dysfunctional and corrupt authoritarian governments . 
But , with Syria immersed in a brutal civil war that has claimed more than 130,000 lives already , Libya on the verge of collapse , and Egypt returning power to the army and proscribing the Muslim Brotherhood , Tunisia has been the only success . 
Tunisia adopted its new constitution on January 27 , thus clearing the way for what will be the most secular and fairest elections in any of the region &apos;s countries . 
The new constitution is the most modern in the Arab world , the fruit of a non-violent transition . 
With a small , well-educated population , Tunisia has become the exception . 
Egypt &apos;s government , by banning the Muslim Brotherhood , has taken the country backward since the military coup that overthrew President Mohamed Morsi last July . 
The Egyptian process , however , should not be considered merely a return to the pre-2011 status quo ; rather , developments constitute what could be characterized as an ascending spiral that , while turning back on itself , nevertheless advances . 
The generational split within Egypt is evident : social mobilization has given young Egyptians valuable political experience , and this represents a key difference from the three decades of former President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s rule . 
The same could be said of Syria , though the spiral there has been an unremittingly downward one , and any reversal remains blocked , particularly since the failure of the second round of peace negotiations in Geneva . 
More generally , lack of pluralism and the inability to share power are holding back the transitions . 
With the exception of Tunisia , this can be seen to varying degrees in all of the affected countries . 
In Egypt , both the army - whether under Mubarak or Field Marshal Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi - and the Islamists have demonstrated that they want all power for themselves . 
Political pluralism cannot be imposed . 
Societies must demand it and build the lasting institutions needed to preserve it . 
This process can take many years , making it crucial not to lose historical perspective . 
The situation in each country was different when the revolts began . 
Countries with homogenous societies , such as Tunisia , have suffered only minimal violence , unlike socially heterogonous countries , such as Syria . 
Nor are there any consolidated regional structures to which the transition countries can adhere ; and there are few local models - with the exception of Turkey , for example - that can be used to help democracy and pluralism take root . 
Indeed , the context in which these transitions were set in motion was - and remains -unfavorable compared to those taking place in Europe . 
Unlike the Arab countries , Eastern Europe and the Balkans benefited from a common starting point and a common path forward : all are part of a continent that has taken historic steps toward integration since World War II . 
That has given them a common destination as well , both politically ( accession to the European Union ) and in terms of their security ( through NATO ) . 
But the situations in Bosnia and Ukraine are still very fluid . 
Twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall , and 23 years after the disintegration of Yugoslavia , the post-communist transition is still incomplete . 
We cannot expect results in the Middle East in three years that have not been achieved in Europe in a quarter-century . 
Despite the backsliding in Egypt and the intolerable violence in Syria , the region is evolving at its own pace in a complex , changing , and unstable geopolitical context . 
A patient strategy and an unwavering dedication to pluralism are fundamental , whether in Kyiv or Cairo .
