Occupy QE 
NEW HAVEN - The Federal Reserve continues to cling to a destabilizing and ineffective strategy . 
By maintaining its policy of quantitative easing ( QE ) - which entails monthly purchases of long-term assets worth $ 85 billion - the Fed is courting an increasingly treacherous endgame at home and abroad . 
By now , the global repercussions are clear , falling most acutely on developing economies with large current-account deficits - namely , India , Indonesia , Brazil , Turkey , and South Africa . 
These countries benefited the most from QE-induced capital inflows , and they were the first to come under pressure when it looked like the spigot was about to be turned off . 
When the Fed flinched at its mid-September policy meeting , they enjoyed a sigh-of-relief rally in their currencies and equity markets . 
But there is an even more insidious problem brewing on the home front . 
With its benchmark lending rate at the zero-bound , the Fed has embraced a fundamentally different approach in attempting to guide the US economy . 
It has shifted its focus from the price of credit to influencing the credit cycle &apos;s quantity dimension through the liquidity injections that quantitative easing requires . 
In doing so , the Fed is relying on the &quot; wealth effect &quot; - brought about largely by increasing equity and home prices - as its principal transmission mechanism for stabilization policy . 
There are serious problems with this approach . 
First , wealth effects are statistically small ; most studies show that only about 3-5 cents of every dollar of asset appreciation eventually feeds through to higher personal consumption . 
As a result , outsize gains in asset markets - and the related risks of new bubbles - are needed to make a meaningful difference for the real economy . 
Second , wealth effects are maximized when debt service is minimized - that is , when interest expenses do not swallow the capital gains of asset appreciation . 
That provides the rationale for the Fed &apos;s zero-interest-rate policy - but at the obvious cost of discriminating against savers , who lose any semblance of interest income . 
Third , and most important , wealth effects are for the wealthy . 
The Fed should know that better than anyone . 
After all , it conducts a comprehensive triennial Survey of Consumer Finances ( SCF ) , which provides a detailed assessment of the role that wealth and balance sheets play in shaping the behavior of a broad cross-section of American consumers . 
In 2010 , the last year for which SCF data are available , the top 10 % of the US income distribution had median holdings of some $ 267,500 in their equity portfolios , nearly 16 times the median holdings of $ 17,000 for the other 90 % . 
Fully 90.6 % of US families in the highest decile of the income distribution owned stocks - double the 45 % ownership share of the other 90 % . 
Moreover , the 2010 SCF shows that the highest decile &apos;s median holdings of all financial assets totaled $ 550,800 , or 20 times the holdings of the other 90 % . 
At the same time , the top 10 % also owned nonfinancial assets ( including primary residences ) with a median value of $ 756,400 - nearly six times the value held by the other 90 % . 
All of this means that the wealthiest 10 % of the US income distribution benefit the most from the Fed &apos;s liquidity injections into risky asset markets . 
And yet , despite the significant increases in asset values traceable to QE over the past several years - residential property as well as financial assets - there has been little to show for it in terms of a wealth-generated recovery in the US economy . 
The problem continues to be the crisis-battered American consumer . 
In the 22 quarters since early 2008 , real personal-consumption expenditure , which accounts for about 70 % of US GDP , has grown at an average annual rate of just 1.1 % , easily the weakest period of consumer demand in the post-World War II era . 
That is the main reason why the post-2008 recovery in GDP and employment has been the most anemic on record . 
Trapped in the aftermath of a wrenching balance-sheet recession , US families remain fixated on deleveraging - paying down debt and rebuilding their income-based saving balances . 
Progress has been slow and limited on both counts . 
Notwithstanding sharp reductions in debt service traceable to the Fed &apos;s zero-interest rate subsidy , the stock of debt is still about 116 % of disposable personal income , well above the 43 % average in the final three decades of the twentieth century . 
Similarly , the personal saving rate , at 4.25 % in the first half of 2013 , is less than half the 9.3 % norm over the 1970-1999 period . 
This underscores yet another of QE &apos;s inherent contradictions : its transmission effects are narrow , while the problems it is supposed to address are broad . 
Wealth effects that benefit a small but extremely affluent slice of the US population have done little to provide meaningful relief for most American families , who remain squeezed by lingering balance-sheet problems , weak labor markets , and anemic income growth . 
Nor is there any reason to believe that the benefits at the top will trickle down . 
With real consumption stuck on a 1 % growth trajectory , the bulk of the US population understandably views economic recovery and job security very differently from those enamored of wealth effects . 
The Fed &apos;s goal of pushing the unemployment rate down to 6.5 % is a noble one . 
The Occupy Wall Street movement began two years ago this month . 
While it can be criticized for its failure to develop a specific agenda for action , it galvanized attention to income and wealth inequality in the US and around the world . 
Unfortunately , the problem has only worsened . 
Lost in the angst over inequality is the critical role that central banks have played in exacerbating the problem . 
Yes , asset markets were initially ecstatic over the Fed &apos;s decision this month not to scale back QE . 
The thrill , however , was lost on Main Street . 
That is precisely the point . 
The Fed &apos;s own survey data , which underscore the concentration of wealth at the upper end of the US income distribution , fit the script of the Occupy movement to a tee . 
QE benefits the few who need it the least . 
That is not exactly a recipe for a broad-based and socially optimal economic recovery .
