What Makes Greece Special ? 
BRUSSELS - The euro crisis seems to be largely over . 
Risk premiums continue to fall across the board , and two countries - Ireland and Portugal - have already exited their adjustment programs . 
They can now finance themselves in the market , and their economies seem to have started growing again . 
By contrast , Greece is still having problems fulfilling the goals of its adjustment program and is engaged in seemingly endless negotiations over yet another multilateral financing package . 
The problem can be summed up in one word : exports ( or , rather , lack of export growth ) . 
The news from Greece these days has been dominated by the announcement that the government achieved a primary budget surplus ( the fiscal balance minus debt service ) in 2013 . 
For the first time in decades , the Greek government has been able to pay for its expenditure with its own revenues . 
This is indeed a milestone . 
But another , much more important news item has received much less attention : Greece exported less in 2013 than in 2012 . 
This lackluster performance , which followed years of decline in market shares , is difficult to explain , given that all other countries on the eurozone periphery recorded solid export growth . 
For example , Portuguese exports increased by about 5-6 % per year over the last years , despite challenging external conditions ( Spain is its biggest market ) and a credit crunch , which made it difficult for exporters to obtain financing . 
Neither weak foreign demand nor a lack of financing , therefore , can be the reason for Greece &apos;s poor export performance . 
Low competitiveness , too , is not an explanation , as real ( inflation-adjusted ) wage costs have declined by more in Greece in recent years than in any other eurozone country , with the exception of Ireland . 
But it would be strange to conclude from Greece &apos;s experience that wage deflation is a useless tool for improving competitiveness , given the widespread assumption that Germany benefited massively from it . 
So the only explanation for Greece &apos;s poor export performance must be that the Greek economy has remained so distorted that it has not responded to changing price signals . 
This lack of adjustment capacity is crucial . 
In Ireland , Spain , and even Portugal , exports grew strongly when the domestic economy collapsed and wages adjusted . 
But these countries were already more flexible and , in some cases , undertook strong reforms . 
In Greece , by contrast , there is no evidence that the many structural reforms imposed by the &quot; troika &quot; ( the European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund ) have led to any real improvement on the ground . 
On the contrary , many indicators of efficiency of the way the government and the labor market work have actually deteriorated . 
The facile argument that Greece has little to export is irrelevant here . 
The problem is not that Greek exports are low , but rather that they have failed to grow , which should have been possible , especially from a low base . 
Several years ago , Greek exports of goods and services were equal to those of Portugal . 
Today , Portugal is ahead by almost â‚¬ 20 billion ( $ 27.5 billion ) . 
This represents a potential loss of more than 10 % of output for Greece . 
Lack of export growth thus has made the recession in Greece much longer and deeper than it would have been otherwise . 
If Greek exports had increased at the same rate as those of Portugal ( or Spain ) , the recession would have ended by now . 
Moreover , the lack of export growth made the fiscal adjustment much more difficult . 
Higher exports would not only have yielded directly higher revenues ; they would have had a multiplier effect on the domestic economy as well , thereby increasing consumption tax revenues . 
Greece now has a balanced current account - quite an achievement after double-digit deficits ( as a percentage of GDP ) a few years ago . 
But , in contrast to other economies on the eurozone periphery , this improvement was achieved entirely through import compression . 
This implies that there cannot be any hope for a sustained recovery unless exports start growing . 
It is often argued that with less austerity , domestic demand would be stronger . 
That might be true , but stronger domestic demand would lead to higher imports , which would need to be paid for with higher export revenues , because the country cannot afford to accumulate more foreign debt . 
No exports , no growth : Greece &apos;s debt sustainability ultimately depends on this key parameter . 
What went wrong in Greece was not the fiscal adjustment . 
On the contrary , austerity was perhaps too successful ( and painful ) . 
But it was the wrong target . 
Missing this target is what has set Greece apart . 
Unfortunately , there is very little the outside world can to do to ensure that the Greece exports more . 
The government can be forced to pass decrees , and Parliament can be pressured to adopt all the reform legislation known to humanity . 
But , in the end , it is how reform is applied on the ground , and how the economy responds , that counts . 
An adjustment program succeeds or fails at home , not in Brussels or Washington .
