How Globalization Stabilizes Poor Countries 
Globalization stands accused of generating economic instability in developing countries and greatly exacerbating poverty , at least in the short run - which is the longest period the world &apos;s poor can afford to care about . 
Critics point to the string of economic crises in Africa , Asia , and Latin America in recent years , often attributing them to multilateral lenders &apos; demands for full liberalization of foreign trade and capital flows , privatization , and fiscal austerity . 
But the raging debate over globalization often overlooks an increasingly important feature that makes life better and more stable for poor people in developing countries right now : the many millions of migrants who send money home . 
Data on families in developing countries that receive money from relatives working abroad directly demonstrate that at least one element of globalization - migration - increases economic stability in poor countries . 
Migrants from struggling countries in Latin America , Southeast Asia , and other regions are increasingly securing jobs at wages that , while low by rich country standards , are far higher than they could dream of back home . 
In 2001 , workers from low- and middle-income countries sent home a staggering $ 43 billion - more than double the level of a decade earlier and $ 5 billion more than that year &apos;s total official foreign aid to these countries . 
Migrant workers may send money home for a variety of reasons : to maintain good family relations , to ensure an inheritance , or to re-pay a loan from elders . 
But whatever the reason , these so-called &quot; remittances &quot;  - the cash workers send home to countries like Colombia , Haiti , Jamaica , Mexico , and Bangladesh - act as a safety net that their governments typically need but cannot afford to provide . 
This is particularly true in small , developing economies . 
Here incomes are often considerably more volatile than in richer countries , owing to heavy reliance on a few commodities or industries and hence higher vulnerability to external shocks , including weather-related and other natural disasters . 
Indeed , poor countries also often lack the private insurance needed to offer the type of emergency assistance that citizens of wealthy nations have come to expect . 
In developing countries , remittances from workers abroad amount to the best insurance around . 
In addition to providing their families at home with a much-needed source of stable income , expatriate migrant workers send home even more money when catastrophe strikes . 
Such remittances enabled thousands of Jamaicans , for example , to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 , when storm damage was estimated at more than one-quarter of the country &apos;s annual GDP and nearly three households in four reported damage . 
Insurance was scarce and the government offered only limited help , providing a mere fraction of the aid that was actually needed . 
Jamaican families got far more help from loved ones living and working in places like Miami , New York , and Los Angeles . 
The same was true when Argentina &apos;s economy collapsed last year , when violence wracked Haiti and a hurricane ravaged Honduras before that , and whenever floods submerge villages in Bangladesh . 
In case after case , billions of dollars in remittances from migrants have given families in poor countries what their governments ( and foreign donors ) could not always provide : food , safety , the resources to recover , and hope . 
The economic importance of such remittances to poor countries in normal times is itself revealing . 
In Jamaica , remittances from workers abroad make up more than 10 % of annual GDP on average - more than double the level of foreign direct investment . 
After Hurricane Gilbert , remittances increased by 25 cents for each dollar of hurricane damage that households incurred . 
To be sure , this implies that the extra money sent home provided only partial insurance . 
Perhaps migrants worry - just like actual insurance companies - that furnishing too much assistance would result in recipients doing less to protect themselves . 
Or maybe the damage from the hurricane was simply too large for migrants to cover completely . 
After all , migrant workers may be relatively well off by standards at home , but they struggle to earn a decent living in their host countries . 
Either way , even if remittances from abroad act as a form of insurance in the event of natural disasters , this does not mean that they will increase when other types of external shocks occur . 
Damage due to hurricanes is relatively easy to observe and can &apos;t be blamed on human mistakes . 
In contrast , it might be more difficult for a migrant in a distant country to assess the extent to which family members back home , knowing that they can always rely on the remittances , are responsible for other forms of income loss . 
Nonetheless , the importance of remittances to households in poor countries , especially during periods of external shock , holds two lessons . 
First , it should be easy and inexpensive for migrants to send money home . 
Today , migrants and their families often pay 10 % or more of the remittances in fees to financial institutions that transfer funds and exchange currencies . 
Reducing these fees would , in effect , be a tax cut for the world &apos;s poorest . 
Second , and perhaps more importantly , we should embrace migration as a proven method of bringing immediate relief and stability to poor nations . 
Given that family members are the best judge of need , migration and remittances may , in fact , constitute a foreign-aid framework that is better targeted and more effective than any government program can ever be .
