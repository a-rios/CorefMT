The Economic Imperatives of the Arab Spring 
WASHINGTON , DC / ISTANBUL - Almost a year has passed since revolution in Tunisia and protests in Cairo &apos;s Tahrir Square toppled ossified authoritarian regimes and ignited a much wider - and still raging - storm in the Arab world . 
No one can safely predict where these events will eventually take the Arab people and nations . 
But one thing is certain : there is no turning back . 
New social and political movements and structures are emerging , power is shifting , and there is hope that democratic processes will strengthen and spread across the Arab world in 2012 . 
Events in the Arab world in 2011 recall other far-reaching regional transitions , such as in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 . 
There are differences , of course , but the upheavals &quot; sweeping and contagious nature is strongly similar to that of the revolutions that brought communism to an end in Europe . 
So , too , is the debate about the relative contributions of political and economic factors to the eventual eruption of popular protest . 
While the yearning for dignity , freedom of expression , and real democratic participation was the driving force underlying the Arab revolutions , economic discontent played a vital role , and economic factors will help to determine how the transition in the Arab world unfolds . Here , three fundamental and longer-term challenges are worth bearing in mind . 
First , growth will have to be much more inclusive , especially in terms of job creation . 
The youth employment-to-population ratio was about 27 % in the Arab countries in 2008 , compared to 53 % in East Asia . 
Moreover , income inequality has widened , with the global phenomenon of increasing concentration of wealth at the top very pronounced in many Arab countries . 
Top incomes in these countries have resulted largely from political patronage , rather than from innovation and hard work . 
While Tunisia was an extreme case of a regime furthering the economic interests of a small clique of insiders , the pattern was widespread . 
That is why a knee-jerk , simplistic &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; prescription of more liberalization and privatization is inappropriate for the Arab world in 2012 . 
There is a clear political need for a growth strategy in which inclusion is the centerpiece , not an afterthought . 
Neither the old statist left , nor the rent-seeking , crony-capitalist right had policies to respond to the yearning for inclusion . 
New political forces in the Arab world , Islam-inspired or social-democratic , will have to propose policies that do not just perpetuate rent-seeking capitalism or reliance on a discredited state bureaucracy . 
It will be necessary to harness grass-roots dynamism and entrepreneurial potential to achieve social solidarity and equity . 
While a truly competitive private sector has to be unleashed , the state must not be weakened but transformed , to become one that is at the service of citizens . 
Generous but targeted and performance-oriented social transfers , conditional on participation in health and basic education programs , will have to replace the old , largely untargeted subsidies . 
Public development finance will have to focus on large-scale access to housing and a people-oriented infrastructure . 
All of this has to be achieved within a sustainable budget framework , requiring both funds and comprehensive administrative reforms . 
Accompanying inclusive growth , the second challenge is skill development , for which a performance-oriented education system must become a top priority . 
Many Arab countries have spent huge sums on education ; the problem is that the return on these investments has been dismal . 
Arab students , for example , score well below average on international mathematics and science tests . 
Deep reforms - focused on quality and performance , rather than on enrollment and diplomas - are needed to transform the learning process and unleash the productivity growth that a young labor force requires . 
The third challenge , instrumental to meeting the first two , will be to strengthen regional Arab solidarity . 
Many outsiders underestimate or purposefully minimize the &quot; Arabness &quot; of the Arab world . 
But the revolutions of 2011 demonstrated that a strong sense of identity , a common language , and much shared history bind Arabs together , despite huge differences in natural-resource endowments , political circumstances , and average per capita incomes . 
How else can one explain that an act of revolt in Tunisia led to popular revolts from North Africa to the Arabian Peninsula ? 
One implication of this is that the oil-rich states and leaders cannot expect to remain isolated and protected from the unfolding events . 
The future of the region is also their future ; the transition that started in 2011 unleashed forces that cannot be stopped . 
But the transition can be more orderly , more peaceful , and less disruptive if states that command immense resources and wealth generously support the poorer countries - and back the reforms that all Arab countries need . 
Existing institutions with proven track records , such as the Arab Fund , can help , but this requires scaling up their funds dramatically . 
Prosperity and peace in the region will depend on thinking big and acting fast . 
The revolutions of 2011 are a historic opportunity for all Arabs . 
Making the most of it will require realism , courage , willingness to change , and a readiness to support change , particularly among those who have the greatest means to do so .
