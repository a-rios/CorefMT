The Right to Die 
On December 21 , an Italian doctor , Mario Riccio , disconnected a respirator that was keeping Piergiorgio Welby alive . 
Welby , who suffered from muscular dystrophy and was paralyzed , had battled unsuccessfully in the Italian courts for the right to die . 
After Riccio gave him a sedative and switched off the respirator , Welby said &quot; thank you &quot; three times to his wife , his friends , and his doctor . 
Forty-five minutes later , he was dead . 
Welby &apos;s request to die was widely publicized in Italy , where it led to heated debate . 
At the time of writing , it is unclear whether Riccio will be charged with any offense . 
At least one Italian politician has called for his arrest on a charge of homicide . 
Welby &apos;s death raises two questions , which need to be distinguished . 
One is whether a person has a right to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment . 
The other is whether voluntary euthanasia is ethically defensible . 
A patient &apos;s informed consent should be a prerequisite for all medical treatment , as long as the patient is a competent adult in a position to make a decision . 
Forcing medical treatment on a competent adult patient who does not want it is tantamount to assault . 
We may think that the patient is making the wrong decision , but we should respect his or her right to make it . 
That right is recognized in most countries , but not , apparently , in Italy . 
Even the Roman Catholic Church has long held that there is no obligation to use &quot; extraordinary &quot; or &quot; disproportionate &quot; means to prolong life - a view reiterated in the &quot; Declaration on Euthanasia &quot; issued by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and approved by Pope John Paul II in 1980 . 
That document states that to refuse a burdensome medical treatment &quot; is not the equivalent of suicide . &quot; 
On the contrary , such a refusal &quot; should be considered an acceptance of the human condition , or a wish to avoid the application of a medical procedure disproportionate to the results that can be expected , or a desire not to impose excessive expense on the family or the community . &quot; 
That description applies well to Welby &apos;s decision . 
On this view , Riccio was doing what anyone should have been prepared to do for Welby , who was paralyzed and unable to implement his refusal of a burdensome medical treatment . 
If the Welby case falls on the right side of the line drawn by Roman Catholic doctrine , the deeper question is whether Church doctrine draws the line in a place that makes sense . 
If an incurably ill patient can refuse burdensome treatment , knowing that this refusal will mean his or her death , why should an incurably ill patient who is not being kept alive by any medical treatment , but finds that the illness itself makes life burdensome , be unable to seek assistance in escaping that burden ? 
Defenders of Catholic teaching would answer that in the latter case , the patient intends to end his life , and that is wrong , whereas in the former case , the patient merely intends to avoid the additional burden that treatment brings . 
Death is , of course , a foreseeable consequence of avoiding that burden , but it is a byproduct that is not directly intended . 
If the patient could avoid the burden and yet continue to live , that would be his choice . 
Welby should not have been helped to die , they might argue , because he expressly said that he wanted to die , not that he wanted to avoid a burdensome treatment . 
This distinction is dubious . 
In both cases , the patient knowingly chooses a course of action that will lead to her or his death , rather than an alternative course of action that would have led to a longer but burdensome life . 
By focusing on the narrower intention to refuse burdensome treatment , rather than the broader implications of the choice , the Roman Catholic Church is able to avoid the inhumane implication that patients must always accept life-prolonging treatment , no matter how painful or costly such treatment may be . 
But it does so at the cost of rendering incoherent its own vigorous opposition to assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia . 
Many countries recognize a legal right to refuse medical treatment . 
But only in the Netherlands , Belgium , Switzerland , and the American state of Oregon are physicians permitted to assist a patient in ending his or her life by means other than withdrawing life-sustaining medical treatment . 
The Netherlands , in particular , has been subjected to a relentless campaign of vilification . 
Critics allege that the legalization of voluntary euthanasia has led to a breakdown of trust in the medical profession and all sorts of other dire consequences . 
But if these allegations are true , no one has told the Dutch . 
Despite a change of government in the Netherlands since voluntary euthanasia was legalized , no effort has been made to repeal the measure . 
There is simply no public support for such a move . 
The Dutch know how voluntary euthanasia is practiced in their country , they know that legal euthanasia has improved , rather than harmed , their medical care , and they want the possibility of assistance in dying , if they should want and need it . 
Isn &apos;t that a choice that everyone should have ?
