Democracy Disconnected 
Something has happened to democracy in the sense of popularly elected government , and it has happened all over the world . 
Somehow people have lost faith in elections . 
Turnout is declining in many countries ; in the case of elections to the European Parliament , the level of voter participation is so risibly low as to call into question the legitimacy of the result . 
But turnout apart , we have become accustomed to accepting that parties or candidates who receive 25 % of the popular vote are &quot; winners . &quot; 
From Holland and Finland to Argentina and Japan , majority governments are formed with minority support . 
Nor are the apparent exceptions proof to the contrary . 
Few American Presidents have been supported by much more than 10 % of eligible voters : half of the US &apos;s eligible voters , indeed , are not even registered to vote ; of those who are registered , half do not vote ; of those who do vote , less than half vote for the winning candidate . 
Even Tony Blair &apos;s &quot; landslide &quot; majority in Britain &apos;s House of Commons rests on shaky ground : Labour received just over 40 % of the vote with a 60 % turnout at the last election in 2002 . 
So only 24 % of the total electorate supported Blair &apos;s party . 
In most countries , this is clearly very different from what elections looked like twenty , let alone fifty , years ago . 
What has happened ? 
One answer must be that voters distrust political parties . 
Electoral democracy operates in most countries through the intermediary of organizations which put up candidates representing specific bundles of policy options , a &quot; manifesto &quot; or a &quot; platform . &quot; 
For a number of reasons , however , this time-honored practice no longer works . 
Ideological party platforms have lost their force ; voters do not accept the specific bundles offered by parties but want to pick and choose . 
Moreover , political parties have become &quot; machines &quot; made up of highly organized cadres of insiders . 
The paradox here is that parties have become more tribal having lost their ideological distinctiveness . 
It is more important to belong than to have a certain set of beliefs . 
Such developments removed parties from the ambit of voters . 
Because most people don &apos;t particularly want to belong to a party , playing the party game becomes a minority sport . 
This increases the public &apos;s suspicion of political parties , not least because - like all professional sports - playing the game is expensive . 
If the cost is borne by the taxpayer , it is resented . 
But if parties are not state-supported , they must find funds through channels that are often dubious , when not illegal . 
Many of the great political scandals of recent decades began with the financing of parties and candidates . 
Other indices - such as sharply declining membership rolls - confirm that parties have become unpopular . 
Yet parties remain indispensable to elective democracy . 
The result is an evident disconnection of the visible political actors from the electorate . 
Because parties operate in parliaments , the disconnection affects one of the crucial democratic institutions . 
People no longer think of parliaments as representing them and thus vested with the legitimacy needed to take decisions on their behalf . 
At this point , a second , quite separate , development comes into play . 
People are more impatient than ever . 
As consumers they are used to instant gratification . 
But as voters , they must wait before they see any results delivered by the choice they made at the ballot box . 
Sometimes they never see the desired results . 
Democracy needs time , not just for elections , but for deliberation and the exercise of checks and balances . 
The consumer-voter , however , will not accept this and therefore turns away . 
There are alternatives , but each has its own problems as a democratic solution . 
Direct action by demonstrations has become a regular and often effective occurrence . 
For the less mobile it can be replaced by electronic expressions of views , from Internet chat-rooms to e-mails to political leaders . 
Then there are non-governmental organizations , often undemocratic in their own structures and yet more closely connected , it seems , to citizens . 
Beyond these , of course , is the possibility of switching off altogether and leaving politics to the professionals so as to concentrate on other dimensions of life . 
The latter is the most risky , because it supports the creeping authoritarianism that is a sign of our times . 
But the other signs of disconnection also create a highly unstable condition in which one can never tell how representative the prevailing views are . 
Some want to cut through the tangle with more direct democracy . 
But lasting connections between leaders and governed can not be created by reducing public debate to simple referendum alternatives . 
There is much to be said for holding on to the classical institutions of parliamentary democracy and trying to reconnect them with the citizenry . 
After all , unpopular parties and falling electoral turnout may merely be passing phenomena . 
New parties may arise and breathe more life into elections and representative government . 
But this will probably not be enough to restore the popular legitimacy that elected governments have lost . 
So rethinking democracy and its institutions must be a top priority for all to whom the constitution of liberty is dear .
