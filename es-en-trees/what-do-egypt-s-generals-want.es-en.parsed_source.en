What do Egypt &apos;s Generals Want ? 
CAIRO - &quot; Whatever the majority in the People &apos;s Assembly , they are very welcome , because they won &apos;t have the ability to impose anything that the people don &apos;t want . &quot; 
Thus declared General Mukhtar al-Mulla , a member of Egypt &apos;s ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces ( SCAF ) . 
Al-Mulla &apos;s message was that the Islamists &quot; victory in Egypt &apos;s recent election gives them neither executive power nor control of the framing of a new constitution . 
But General Sami Anan , Chief of Staff and the SCAF &apos;s deputy head , quickly countered that al-Mulla &apos;s statement does not necessarily represent the official views of the Council . 
So , one year after the revolution that overthrew Hosni Mubarak , who , exactly , will set Egypt &apos;s political direction ? 
The electoral victory of the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s political wing and the Salafi parties , which together won more than 70 % of the parliamentary seats , will give them strong influence over the transitional period and in drafting the constitution . 
But they are not alone . 
Aside from the Islamists , two other powerful actors will have their say : the &quot; Tahrirists &quot; and the generals . 
Tahrir Square-based activism has not only brought about social and political change , but also has served as the ultimate tool of pro-democracy pressure on Egypt &apos;s military rulers . 
Indeed , while the army , the most powerful of the three actors , still officially controls the country , there is little confidence in the generals &quot; commitment to democracy . 
&quot; The SCAF are either anti-democratic .... or some of their advisers told them that democracy is not in their best interest , &quot; says Hazem Abd al-Azim , a nominee in the first post-Mubarak government . 
If the generals do not want democracy , nor do they want direct military rule Ã  la Augusto Pinochet . 
So , what do they want ? 
Ideally , they would like to combine the Algerian army &apos;s current power and the Turkish army &apos;s legitimacy . 
This implies a parliament with limited powers , a weak presidency subordinate to the army , and constitutional prerogatives that legitimate the army &apos;s intervention in politics . 
The minimum that they insist on is reflected in statements by Generals al-Mulla , Mamdouh Shahim , Ismail Etman , and others . 
That would mean a veto in high politics , independence for the army &apos;s budget and vast economic empire , legal immunity from prosecution on charges stemming from corruption or repression , and constitutional prerogatives to guarantee these arrangements . 
The new parliament and constitutional assembly will have to lead the negotiations with the SCAF . 
But , given that any successful democratic transition must include meaningful civilian control over the armed forces and the security apparatus , the SCAF &apos;s minimum demands could render the process meaningless . 
The veto in high politics would include any issues that touch on national security or sensitive foreign policy , most importantly the relationship with Israel . 
With an Islamist majority in the parliament promising to &quot; revise &quot; the peace agreement with Israel , tensions over foreign policy are likely to rise . 
The independent military-commercial empire , which benefits from preferential customs and exchange rates , no taxation , land-confiscation rights , and an army of almost-free laborers ( conscripted soldiers ) , is another thorny issue . 
With the Egyptian economy suffering , elected politicians might seek to improve conditions by moving against the military &apos;s civilian assets - namely , by revising the preferential rates and imposing a form of taxation . 
Immunity from prosecution is no less salient . 
&quot; The Field-Marshal should be in jail now , &quot; screamed the elected leftist MP , Abu Ezz al-Hariri , on the second day of the new parliamentary session . 
When Mahmoud Ghozlan , the Muslim Brotherhood spokesperson , proposed immunity ( known in Egypt as the &quot; safe-exit &quot; option ) , he faced a wave of harsh criticism . 
Pressure from the United States has also influenced the SCAF &apos;s decision-making . 
&quot; The military establishment receives $ 1.3 billion from the US .... They are very sensitive to US requests , &quot; according to Saad Eddin Ibrahim , who lobbied the Obama administration to support the revolution in January 2011 . 
But most of the SCAF &apos;s pro-democracy decisions have come as a result of massive pressure from Tahrir Square . 
This includes the removal of Mubarak , his trial ( and that of other regime figures ) , and bringing forward the presidential election from 2013 to June 2012 . 
Two other factors are equally , if not more , influential : the status quo inherited from the Mubarak era and the army &apos;s internal cohesion . 
With few exceptions , the SCAF &apos;s members benefited significantly from Mubarak &apos;s regime . 
&quot; The sight of officers in uniform protesting in Tahrir Square and speaking on Al Jazeera really worries the Field Marshal , &quot; a former officer told me . 
And one way to maintain internal cohesion is to create &quot; demons &quot; - a lesson learned from the &quot; dirty wars &quot; in Algeria in the 1990 &quot; s and Argentina in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s . 
In particular , Coptic protesters are an easy target against which to rally soldiers and officers . 
Last October , amid an unnecessary escalation of sectarian violence , state-owned television featured a hospitalized Egyptian soldier screaming , &quot; The Copts killed my colleague ! &quot; 
The systematic demonization of the Tahririst groups , and the violent escalation that followed in November and December , served the same purpose . 
Despite everything , democratic Egypt is not a romantic fantasy . 
A year ago , Saad al-Ketatni , the Muslim Brotherhood leader , would never have dreamed of being Speaker of Parliament . 
The same applies to the leftists and liberals who now hold around 20 % of the parliament &apos;s seats . 
If 2011 witnessed the miracle of Mubarak &apos;s removal , a brave parliament &apos;s institutional assertiveness , coupled with non-institutional Tahririst pressure , could force the generals to accept a transfer of power to civilian rule ( with some reserved domains for the army establishment ) in 2012 . 
What is certain is that this year will not witness a return to the conditions of 2010 . 
Egypt may become stuck in democratization &apos;s slow lane , but there will be no U-turn .
