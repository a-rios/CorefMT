Muzzled in the Name of Freedom 
NEW YORK - Acts of terror can inflict terrible damage . 
Only those who govern our democracies can do that , by shrinking our freedoms in freedom &apos;s name . 
Shinzo Abe , Japan &apos;s right-wing nationalist prime minister , does not need much encouragement to tighten up secrecy laws , give more powers to the police , or make it easier to use military force . 
The grisly executions of two Japanese citizens caught by Islamic State terrorists in Syria have provided precisely the encouragement that Abe needs to pursue such measures . 
But Japan has never been seen as a bastion of free speech , nor did it ever make great claims to be . 
France does . 
That is what the demonstration of solidarity in the face of last month &apos;s terrorist attacks in Paris was surely all about . 
France , of all countries , would avoid the trap that snared the other great Western republic claiming to be a beacon of freedom in the world . 
Fear of terrorist violence after the 9 / 11 attacks did more damage to freedom in the United States than the suicidal murder of thousands of its citizens . 
Because of that fear , Americans allow themselves to be spied on indiscriminately by their own government , and permit terrorism suspects to be tortured and locked up indefinitely without trial . 
France , like most other countries in the European Union , already has laws that ban hate speech . 
You cannot legally insult people on the grounds of their race , beliefs , or sexual orientation . 
President Fran√ßois Hollande , who is not a right-wing nationalist like Abe , now wants to strengthen those bans . 
He has proposed new laws that would make online entities like Google and Facebook responsible for any &quot; hate speech &quot; posted online by their users . 
Former EU heads of state have also backed a proposal from European Jewish leaders to criminalize in every EU country not just anti-Semitism and genocide-denial , but also &quot; xenophobia &quot; in general . 
Few people would wish to defend expressions of xenophobia or anti-Semitism . 
First of all , such laws , if enacted , are unlikely to reduce the risk of terrorist acts . 
Banning the expression of opinions will not make them go away . 
They will continue to be expressed , more secretively perhaps , and as a result become even more toxic . 
And the social and political basis for terrorism , in the Middle East and elsewhere , will not vanish just because of a public ban on xenophobic speech . 
But there is a larger danger in using the law to police what people think . 
It can stifle public debate . 
That danger underlies the view , still operative in the US , that opinions , however obnoxious , should be freely expressible , so that they can be opposed by counter-arguments . 
It would be naive , of course , to believe that religious or political extremists are interested in an exchange of views . 
Xenophobic views , or the denial of genocide , are repellent , but do not necessarily result in such a threat . 
In most societies , including the US , the public expression of such opinions is limited by a rough consensus on what is socially respectable . 
This consensus changes with time . 
It is up to editors , writers , politicians , and others who speak in public to shape it . 
Cartoonists , artists , bloggers , activists , and comedians sometimes like to challenge the consensus of respectability . 
Some of these challenges might cause outrage ( that , after all , often is the point ) . 
Allowing the government to decide which opinions are permissible is dangerous not just because it smothers debate , but also because governments can be arbitrary or self-serving . 
It would be useful in the current climate of fear to recall a famous hate-speech case in the US . 
A local court , prompted by shocked and fearful public opinion , decided that the display of swastikas , distribution of leaflets , and the wearing of Nazi uniforms should be banned . 
Such a demonstration , it was quite plausibly argued , would be an insult to a community that included Holocaust survivors . 
But the ban was contested by the American Civil Liberties Union as an infringement of the First Amendment . 
The argument of the ACLU lawyers , most of whom were liberal Jews , was not based on any sympathy for Nazi symbols or views . 
Their argument was that if you allow the government to ban opinions you hate or despise , you weaken your right to contest a similar ban on views with which you might agree . 
Freedom of speech , in other words , should mean freedom of hateful speech , too , as long as it does not threaten or promote violence . 
Most European governments already take a stricter view of public insults than the US Constitution does . 
Terrorist attacks are doing enough damage , in lives and property . 
There is no reason for governments to make things worse by tampering with their citizens &apos; liberties .
