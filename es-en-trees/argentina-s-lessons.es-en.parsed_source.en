Argentina \ u0027s Lessons 
Argentina &apos;s collapse incited the largest default in history . 
Pundits agree this is merely the latest in a string of IMF-led bailouts that squandered billions of dollars and failed to save the economies they were meant to help . 
The nature of that failure , however , is disputed . 
Some claim that the IMF was too lenient ; others that it was too tough . 
Those who blame the IMF see the problem as self-inflicted through profligate and corrupt spending by Argentina . 
Such attempts at blame-shifting are misguided : one can understand the default as the consequence of economic mistakes made over a decade . 
Understanding what went wrong provides important lessons for the future . 
The problems began with the hyperinflation of the 1980s . 
To slash inflation , expectations needed to be changed ; &quot; anchoring &quot; the currency to the dollar was supposed to do this . 
This was a return to a variant of the old gold standard argument . 
If inflation continued , the country &apos;s real exchange rate would appreciate , the demand for its exports would fall , unemployment would increase , and that would dampen wage and price pressures . 
Market participants , knowing this , would realize that inflation would not be sustained . 
So long as the commitment to the exchange rate system remained credible , so was the commitment to halt inflation . 
If inflationary expectations were changed , then disinflation could occur without the costly unemployment . 
This prescription worked for a time in a few countries , but was risky , as Argentina was to show . 
The IMF encouraged this exchange rate system . 
Now they are less enthusiastic , though Argentina , not the IMF , is paying the price . 
The peg did lower inflation ; but it did not promote sustained growth . 
Argentina should have been encouraged to fix a more flexible exchange rate system , or at least an exchange rate more reflective of the country &apos;s trading patterns . 
Other mistakes in Argentina &apos;s &quot; reform &quot; program also occurred . 
Argentina was praised for allowing large foreign ownership of banks . 
For a while this created a seemingly more stable banking system , but that system failed to lend to small and medium sized firms . 
After the burst of growth that arrived with hyperinflation &apos;s end , growth slowed , partly because firms in the country couldn &apos;t get adequate finance . 
Argentina &apos;s government recognized the problem , but was hit by numerous shocks beyond its control before it could act . 
East Asia &apos;s crisis of 1997 provided the first hit . 
Partly because of IMF mismanagement , this became a global financial crisis , raising interest rates for all emerging markets including Argentina . 
Argentina &apos;s exchange rate system survived , but at a heavy price - the onset of double-digit unemployment . 
Soon , high interest rates strained the country &apos;s budget . 
Yet Argentina &apos;s debt to GDP ratio - even as it began to collapse - remained moderate , at around 45 % , lower than Japan &apos;s . 
But with 20 % interest rates , 9 % of the country &apos;s GDP would be spent annually on financing its debt . 
The government pursued fiscal austerity , but not enough to make up for the vagaries of the market . 
The global financial crisis that followed East Asia &apos;s crisis set off a series of big exchange rate adjustments . 
The dollar , to which Argentina &apos;s peso was tied , increased sharply in value . 
Meanwhile , Argentina &apos;s neighbor and Mercosur trading partner , Brazil , saw its currency depreciate - some say that it became significantly undervalued . 
Wages and prices fell , but not enough to allow Argentina to compete effectively , especially since many of the agricultural goods which constitute Argentina &apos;s natural comparative advantages face high hurdles in entering the markets of rich countries . 
Hardly had the world recovered from the 1997-1998 financial crisis when it slid into the 2000 / 2001 global slowdown , worsening Argentina &apos;s situation . 
Here the IMF made its fatal mistake . 
It encouraged a contractionary fiscal policy , the same mistake it had made in East Asia , and with the same disastrous consequence . 
Fiscal austerity was supposed to restore confidence . 
But the numbers in the IMF program were fiction ; any economist would have predicted that contractionary policies incite slowdown , and that budget targets would not be met . 
Needless to say , the IMF program did not fulfill its commitments . 
Confidence is seldom restored as an economy goes into a deep recession and double-digit unemployment . 
Perhaps a military dictator , like Chile &apos;s Pinochet , could suppress the social and political unrest that arises in such conditions . 
But in Argentina &apos;s democracy , this was impossible . 
In repeated visits to Argentina , I marveled at how long suffering the Argentineans were ; to me , it is more a surprise that unrest took so long to manifest itself , not that street turmoil unseated Argentina &apos;s president . 
Seven lessons must now be drawn : 
1 . 
In a world of volatile exchange rates , pegging a currency to one like the dollar is highly risky . 
Argentina should have been encouraged to move off its exchange rate system years ago . 
2 . 
Globalization exposes a country to enormous shocks . 
Countries must cope with those shocks - adjustments in exchange rates are part of the coping mechanism . 
3 . 
You ignore social and political contexts at your peril . 
Any government that follows policies which leave large fractions of the population unemployed or underemployed is failing in its primary mission . 
4 . 
A single-minded focus on inflation - without a concern for unemployment or growth - is risky . 
5 . 
Growth requires financial institutions that lend to domestic firms . 
Selling banks to foreign owners , without creating appropriate safeguards , may impede growth and stability . 
6 . 
One seldom restores economic strength - or confidence - with policies that force an economy into a deep recession . 
For insisting on contractionary policies , the IMF bears its great culpability . 
7 . 
Better ways are needed to deal with situations akin to Argentina . 
I argued for this during East Asia &apos;s crisis ; the IMF argued against me , preferring its big-bail-out strategy . 
Now the IMF belatedly recognizes that it should explore alternatives . 
The IMF will work hard to shift blame - there will be allegations of corruption , and it will be said that Argentina did not pursue needed measures . 
Of course , the country needed to undertake other reforms - but following the IMF &apos;s advice regarding contractionary fiscal policies made matters worse . 
Argentina &apos;s crisis should remind us of the pressing need to reform the global financial system - and thorough reform of the IMF is where we must begin .
