How Effective is Disaster Relief ? 
When disaster strikes , non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) are among the first on the scene . 
The United Nations estimates that there are now more than 37,000 international NGOs , with major donors relying on them more and more . 
Inevitably , there are problems . 
Both the Rwandan genocide of 1994 and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami saw chaotic competition among NGOs . 
Yet there have also been landmark successes . 
More than 1,400 NGOs operating in 90 countries helped to get 123 countries to ratify the treaty banning landmines . 
But the sheer scale of the disaster relief &quot; industry &quot; - plus the longer-term development efforts of NGOs - is raising serious concerns about how to measure their performance . 
Flexibility allows NGOs to be innovative in ways that organizations like the UN often cannot . 
But there are few international rules on what an NGO actually is , and the lack of control can lead to unpredictable consequences . 
In Chad recently , the French NGO L &apos;Arche de Zo√© tried to smuggle children out of the country without obtaining permission from either parents or the government . 
Among the questions being asked by NGOs , the UN , and national donors is how to prevent the recurrence of past mistakes . 
The wake-up call for most NGOs came after the Rwandan genocide , when hundreds of small organizations tried to set up ad hoc operations in refugee camps in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania . 
Some camps turned into staging posts for armed factions . 
In the ensuing chaos , more than 50,000 refugees died from cholera . 
There was also mayhem following the Indian Ocean tsunami . 
At one point , more than 400 NGOs were on the ground in Aceh , Indonesia , competing for resources , personnel , and funding . 
Many of the lessons learned in Rwanda were forgotten or ignored as smaller NGOs with little or no experience in dealing with disasters caused much of the confusion . 
The situation in Indonesia led the UN to adopt a new &quot; cluster &quot; system to improve coordination . 
And , after a review of the Rwanda debacle , 400 NGOs and UN organizations working in 80 countries got together in the Sphere Project to develop a common humanitarian mandate and handbook of standards outlining the minimum performance required of any NGO working in a disaster zone . 
As the number of post-intervention reviews increases , a rudimentary framework for evaluating the impact of NGOs has appeared . 
Rather than simply looking at project inputs and outputs , the emphasis has turned towards measuring the overall impact of an operation . 
The idea is to find out if the lives of the people on the receiving end were changed for the better in any sustained way . 
More and more donors are also insisting that NGOs provide measurable proof that they make a difference . 
That sounds fine in theory , but in practice there are drawbacks . 
By demanding quantifiable results , donors may force program managers to choose easily achieved targets over less measurable actions that accord with sound humanitarian principles . 
Or reporting about aid programs may be skewed to keep donor funds flowing . 
The greatest danger is that humanitarian relief will be tailored to meet donors &quot; demands , rather than actual needs . 
Until recently , the record on evaluating responses to humanitarian emergencies has been patchy at best . 
CARE , as both a relief and development agency , can take a long-term approach to disasters , matching emergency relief with a rehabilitation and recovery phase . 
But this is not an option for NGOs that focus only on emergency responses . 
Once their allotted time is up - or their funds run out - they tend to pack up and leave . 
Even for NGOs that stick around , determining their relief efforts &quot; impact in the middle of a crisis is difficult , if not impossible . 
Emergencies are chaotic : staff and resources are stretched , the local population is very unlikely to be able to provide meaningful feedback , and pre-crisis baseline data are largely unavailable , so comparisons are complicated . 
Moreover , all too often , events move too quickly to be measured accurately . 
And , until recently , donors who were willing to pay for relief were less likely to finance follow-up evaluations . 
As a result , emergency relief evaluations often rely on little more than guesswork and assumptions . 
A 2004 report by the Humanitarian Policy Group cited a survey carried out in Ethiopia after UN agencies said that humanitarian efforts had averted widespread famine in 2000 . 
The claim sounded credible until the subsequent survey showed that the area &apos;s crude mortality rate had actually risen to six times the normal base rate . 
Most of the deaths were from communicable diseases , which malnourished people may well have contracted after crowding into feeding centers . 
The HPG therefore recommended long-term monitoring of future humanitarian responses , and said that success or failure should be judged in a broad context rather than by a narrow focus on a specific project . 
Many people who survive an earthquake or a flood , for instance , may soon face another crisis if the disaster also destroys their only means of earning a living . 
New and more sophisticated analytical tools are needed to understand these long-term effects , along with sufficient training to ensure that new methods are applied properly in the field . 
A recent innovation has been the Coping Strategy Index , devised by the World Food Program and CARE , which analyzes how people cope with short-term food crises while also taking into account their future vulnerability to hunger . 
NGOs do the lion &apos;s share of the world &apos;s humanitarian work , and some mistakes are inevitable . 
But as we deepen our experience of humanitarian relief and development , we must learn the lessons of the past and understand how much more there is to know .
