Europe &apos;s Debt Wish 
CAMBRIDGE - Eurozone leaders continue to debate how best to reinvigorate economic growth , with French and Italian leaders now arguing that the eurozone &apos;s rigid &quot; fiscal compact &quot; should be loosened . 
Meanwhile , the leaders of the eurozone &apos;s northern member countries continue to push for more serious implementation of structural reform . 
Ideally , both sides will get their way , but it is difficult to see an endgame that does not involve significant debt restructuring or rescheduling . 
The inability of Europe &apos;s politicians to contemplate this scenario is placing a huge burden on the European Central Bank . 
Although there are many explanations for the eurozone &apos;s lagging recovery , it is clear that the overhang of both public and private debt looms large . 
The gross debts of households and financial institutions are higher today as a share of national income than they were before the financial crisis . 
Nonfinancial corporate debt has fallen only slightly . 
And government debt , of course , has risen sharply , owing to bank bailouts and a sharp , recession-fueled decline in tax revenues . 
Yes , Europe is also wrestling with an aging population . 
Southern eurozone countries such as Italy and Spain have suffered from rising competition with China in textiles and light manufacturing industries . 
But just as the pre-crisis credit boom masked underlying structural problems , post-crisis credit constraints have greatly amplified the downturn . 
True , German growth owes much to the country &apos;s willingness a decade ago to engage in painful economic reforms , especially of labor-market rules . 
Today , Germany appears to have full employment and above-trend growth . 
German leaders believe , with some justification , that if France and Italy were to adopt similar reforms , the changes would work wonders for their economies &quot; long-term growth . 
Yet what of Portugal , Ireland , and ( especially ) Spain , all of which have taken significant steps toward reform since the crisis ? 
All are still experiencing double-digit unemployment rates amid moribund growth , and , as the last International Monetary Fund Fiscal Monitor made abundantly clear , all still suffer from significant debt problems . 
Debt overhang traps countries in a vicious circle . 
Exceptionally high public and private debts constrain a country &apos;s options and are indisputably associated with slower growth , which in turn makes it difficult to escape a debt trap . 
Last spring &apos;s campaign against anyone who dared to worry about the long-run effects of high debt largely ignored the substantial academic literature , just as a remarkably similar recent challenge to Thomas Piketty &apos;s research on inequality took no account of a larger body of evidence . 
It is true that not all debt is created equal , and there is a strong case for adding more of it if the purpose is to finance highly productive infrastructure investments . 
Europe greatly lags many Asian countries in its efforts to expand the reach of broadband . 
Outside the Nordic countries , electricity networks are thoroughly Balkanized , and major efforts are needed to integrate them . 
Raising debt for the purposes of significantly increasing or ensuring long-run growth makes sense , especially in an environment of low real interest rates . 
A similar argument can be made for expenditures aimed at improving education , for example to improve Europe &apos;s underfunded universities . 
Beyond growth-enhancing investment , however , the case for greater stimulus becomes more nuanced . 
Brad Delong and Larry Summers have argued that in a repressed economy , short-term increases in borrowing can pay for themselves , even if the expenditures do not directly increase long-run potential . 
By contrast , Alberto Alesina and Silvia Ardagna argue that in an economy with a large and inefficient government , debt-stabilization measures directed at reducing the size of government can actually be expansionary . 
I admit to being an outsider to this debate . 
( The word &quot; austerity &quot; does not appear once in my 2009 book with Carmen Reinhart on the history of financial crises . ) 
My general sense , however , is that both views are extreme . 
In general , neither pure austerity nor crude Keynesian stimulus can help countries escape high-debt traps . 
Throughout history , other measures , including debt rescheduling , inflation , and various forms of wealth taxation ( such as financial repression ) , have typically played a significant role . 
It is hard to see how European countries can indefinitely avoid recourse to the full debt toolkit , especially to repair the fragile economies of the eurozone &apos;s periphery . 
The ECB &apos;s expansive &quot; whatever it takes &quot; guarantee may indeed be enough to help finance greater short-term stimulus than is currently being allowed ; but the ECB &apos;s guarantee will not solve long-run sustainability problems . 
Indeed , the ECB will soon have to confront the fact that structural reforms and fiscal austerity fall far short of being a complete solution to Europe &apos;s debt problems . 
In October and November , the ECB will announce the results of its bank stress tests . 
Because many banks hold a large volume of eurozone government debt , the results will depend very much on how the ECB assesses sovereign risk . 
If the ECB grossly understates the risks , its credibility as a regulator will be badly tarnished . 
If it is more forthright about the risks , there is a chance that some periphery countries might have difficulty plugging the holes , and will require help from the north . 
One hopes that the ECB will be forthright . 
It is high time for a conversation on debt relief for the entire eurozone periphery .
