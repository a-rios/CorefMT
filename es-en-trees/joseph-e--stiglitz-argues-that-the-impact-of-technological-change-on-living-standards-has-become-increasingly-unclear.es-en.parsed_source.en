The Innovation Enigma 
NEW YORK - Around the world , there is enormous enthusiasm for the type of technological innovation symbolized by Silicon Valley . 
In this view , America &apos;s ingenuity represents its true comparative advantage , which others strive to imitate . 
But there is a puzzle : it is difficult to detect the benefits of this innovation in GDP statistics . 
What is happening today is analogous to developments a few decades ago , early in the era of personal computers . 
In 1987 , economist Robert Solow - awarded the Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on growth - lamented that &quot; You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics . &quot; 
There are several possible explanations for this . 
Perhaps GDP does not really capture the improvements in living standards that computer-age innovation is engendering . 
Or perhaps this innovation is less significant than its enthusiasts believe . 
As it turns out , there is some truth in both perspectives . 
Recall how a few years ago , just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers , the financial sector prided itself on its innovativeness . 
Given that financial institutions had been attracting the best and brightest from around the world , one would have expected nothing less . 
But , upon closer inspection , it became clear that most of this innovation involved devising better ways of scamming others , manipulating markets without getting caught ( at least for a long time ) , and exploiting market power . 
In this period , when resources flowed to this &quot; innovative &quot; sector , GDP growth was markedly lower than it was before . 
Even in the best of times , it did not lead to an increase in living standards ( except for the bankers ) , and it eventually led to the crisis from which we are only now recovering . 
The net social contribution of all of this &quot; innovation &quot; was negative . 
Similarly , the dot-com bubble that preceded this period was marked by innovation - Web sites through which one could order dog food and soft drinks online . 
At least this era left a legacy of efficient search engines and a fiber-optic infrastructure . 
But it is not an easy matter to assess how the time savings implied by online shopping , or the cost savings that might result from increased competition ( owing to greater ease of price comparison online ) , affects our standard of living . 
Two things should be clear . 
First , the profitability of an innovation may not be a good measure of its net contribution to our standard of living . 
In our winner-takes-all economy , an innovator who develops a better Web site for online dog-food purchases and deliveries may attract everyone around the world who uses the Internet to order dog food , making enormous profits in the process . 
But without the delivery service , much of those profits simply would have gone to others . 
The Web site &apos;s net contribution to economic growth may in fact be relatively small . 
Moreover , if an innovation , such as ATMs in banking , leads to increased unemployment , none of the social cost - neither the suffering of those who are laid off nor the increased fiscal cost of paying them unemployment benefits - is reflected in firms &quot; profitability . 
Likewise , our GDP metric does not reflect the cost of the increased insecurity individuals may feel with the increased risk of a loss of a job . 
Equally important , it often does not accurately reflect the improvement in societal wellbeing resulting from innovation . 
In a simpler world , where innovation simply meant lowering the cost of production of , say , an automobile , it was easy to assess an innovation &apos;s value . 
But when innovation affects an automobile &apos;s quality , the task becomes far more difficult . 
And this is even more apparent in other arenas : How do we accurately assess the fact that , owing to medical progress , heart surgery is more likely to be successful now than in the past , leading to a significant increase in life expectancy and quality of life ? 
Still , one cannot avoid the uneasy feeling that , when all is said and done , the contribution of recent technological innovations to long-term growth in living standards may be substantially less than the enthusiasts claim . 
A lot of intellectual effort has been devoted to devising better ways of maximizing advertising and marketing budgets - targeting customers , especially the affluent , who might actually buy the product . 
But standards of living might have been raised even more if all of this innovative talent had been allocated to more fundamental research - or even to more applied research that could have led to new products . 
Yes , being better connected with each other , through Facebook or Twitter , is valuable . 
But how can we compare these innovations with those like the laser , the transistor , the Turing machine , and the mapping of the human genome , each of which has led to a flood of transformative products ? 
Of course , there are grounds for a sigh of relief . 
Although we may not know how much recent technological innovations are contributing to our wellbeing , at least we know that , unlike the wave of financial innovations that marked the pre-crisis global economy , the effect is positive .
