Iran on the Warpath 
BERLIN - While Europe remains preoccupied with its own slow-motion crisis , and other global powers continue to be mesmerized by the bizarre spectacle of European officials &quot; myriad efforts to rescue the euro ( and thus the global financial system ) , clouds of war are massing over Iran once more . 
For years , Iran has been pursuing both a nuclear program and the development of long-range missiles , which points to only one conclusion : the country &apos;s leaders are intent on building nuclear weapons , or at least on reaching the technological threshold beyond which only a single political decision is required to achieve that end . 
The latter course would arguably keep Iran within the scope of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , to which it is a signatory . 
Otherwise , Iran &apos;s nuclear and missile programs would be a pointless waste of money . 
After all , Iran does not need uranium-enrichment technology . 
The country has only one civilian nuclear reactor , with fuel rods supplied by Russia , and the Iranian technology now being developed cannot be used in it . 
But uranium enrichment makes a lot of sense if you want a nuclear weapon ; indeed , for that purpose , enrichment is indispensable . 
Moreover , Iran is building a heavy-water reactor , supposedly for research purposes , but which is also needed to build a plutonium bomb . 
Iran has , in violation of the NPT , hidden substantial parts of this program . 
The country has also spent millions of dollars on illegal purchases of enrichment technology and nuclear-weapon designs from the Pakistani nuclear scientist and black marketeer A.Q. Khan , the &quot; Father of the Pakistani bomb . &quot; 
Iran tried to conceal these transactions for years , until its cover was blown when Libya began to cooperate with the West and exposed the Khan network . 
An Iran armed with nuclear weapons ( or one political decision away from possessing them ) would drastically alter the Middle East &apos;s strategic balance . 
At best , a nuclear-arms race would threaten to consume this already-unstable region , which would endanger the NPT , with far-reaching global consequences . 
At worst , nuclear weapons would serve Iran &apos;s &quot; revolutionary &quot; foreign policy in the region , which the country &apos;s leaders have pursued since the birth of the Islamic Republic in 1979 . 
The combination of an anti-status quo foreign policy and nuclear weapons and missiles is a nightmare not only for Israel , which at least has second-strike capabilities , but also for Iran &apos;s non-nuclear Arab neighbors and Turkey . 
Indeed , the Gulf States , including Saudi Arabia , feel more existentially threatened by Iran than Israel does . 
Europe &apos;s security profile , too , would change dramatically if Iran were to possess nuclear warheads and long-range missiles . 
All attempts at negotiations have led nowhere , with Iran continuing to enrich uranium and improve its nuclear technology . 
Sanctions , while useful , work only in the very long term , and a change in the balance of power within the country is not foreseeable in the short term . 
So it is only a matter of time - and not much time - until Iran &apos;s neighbors and the international community will confront a fateful choice : either accept Iran as a nuclear power , or decide that the mere prospect , as it becomes more realistic , is leading to war . 
President Barack Obama has already made clear that the United States will not accept Iran as a nuclear power under any circumstances . 
The same is true of Israel and Iran &apos;s Arab neighbors in the Gulf . 
The next year promises to be critical . 
The Israeli government recently suggested that Iran would reach the nuclear threshold within nine months , and Iran could become a major issue in the long run-up to the US presidential election in November 2012 . 
On the other hand , talk of military intervention - which , under the circumstances , would largely boil down to air strikes - is cheap . 
There are grave doubts about whether the Iranian nuclear program could be eliminated from the air . 
In fact , with large parts of the world most likely condemning any attack , military intervention could clear the diplomatic path to an Iranian bomb . 
It is better not to dwell on what the Middle East might look like after this kind of confrontation . 
Iranian opposition forces would likely be the first victim of Western military action , and , elsewhere in the region , the Arab Spring would likely be submerged under a massive anti-Western wave of solidarity with Iran . 
The region would be pushed back into violence and terror , instead of continuing its transformation from the bottom up . 
The effects on the global economy would be no less significant , to say nothing of the humanitarian consequences . 
A last-ditch diplomatic solution appears unlikely , given that the nuclear question plays a decisive role in the Iranian regime &apos;s factional struggles , in which anyone favoring compromise can be considered the loser . 
Moreover , Iran &apos;s leaders seem to assume that the country is too big and too strong to be subdued by sanctions or air strikes . 
Historically , the road to disaster has usually been paved with good intentions and grave errors of judgment . 
Further escalation in the Middle East will culminate in these wretched alternatives sooner rather than later , unless a diplomatic solution is found ( or unless diplomacy can at least buy time ) . 
Unfortunately , that may be unlikely in the year ahead . 
In the absence of any viable route to US diplomatic engagement with Iran , the burden of organizing , convening , and conducting such highly sensitive negotiations falls on Europe .
