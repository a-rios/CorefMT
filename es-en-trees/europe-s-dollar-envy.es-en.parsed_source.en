Europe \ u0027s Dollar Envy 
Currencies can become the focus not just for commercial transactions , but for diplomatic and political wrangles . 
When this happens , commercial transactions become more difficult and subject to greater uncertainty . 
The politicization of money during the interwar depression was economically devastating . 
But there have been more recent occurrences of nasty currency wars . 
In the 1960 &apos;s the international monetary order became the focus of a political tug-of-war . 
Each side had quite different theories and explanations of what was going on . 
The Europeans - in particular the French - complained about what General Charles de Gaulle termed the &quot; exorbitant privilege &quot; of the US dollar . 
The General and his monetary guru , Jacques Rueff , argued that the US used the dollar &apos;s status as the major reserve currency of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange-rate regime in order to run deficits and pay for its overseas military adventurism ( at that time in Vietnam ) . 
France responded with calls for monetary reform that would end the peculiar role of the dollar and tried to revive the largely discredited gold standard . 
Europeans began a long discussion of the advantages of monetary union , achievement of which would allow them to look the dollar in the face . 
But from the American point of view , the international role of the dollar was a trap . 
Other countries could change their exchange rates , and in this way could maintain greater export competitiveness . 
The US government was powerless in the face of an undervalued yen , fueling the belief that the rest of the world was using the dollar to attack America &apos;s manufacturing base . 
The Nixon administration came to the conclusion that the only way to save the American economy was to engage in monetary unilateralism - a monetary expansion so dramatic that other countries would be forced into adjusting their exchange rates . 
These long-forgotten battles seem suddenly very immediate once again . 
The world no longer has a fixed exchange-rate regime , but the dollar remains the major reserve currency - a sort of floating Bretton Woods . 
For Americans the reserve role of the dollar is a potential threat , while for non-Americans it is yet another instance of an American neo-imperial quest for hegemony . 
In this decade , China has taken the place of 1960 &apos;s Japan , holding its exchange rate down in order to push export growth . 
Consequently it is the target of US complaints about unfair competition , and of efforts to force an exchange-rate adjustment that would deter Americans from buying Chinese toys , appliances , and clothing . 
Manufacturers in the US have decided that Chinese-made bras constitute a threat to the American way of life . 
Meanwhile , Europeans ( especially the French ) complain about the big US deficits , and de Gaulle &apos;s argument that the rest of the world is paying for America &apos;s wars is in fashion again . 
Some Europeans suggest that Asian central banks should hold a greater part of their reserves in euros , an echo of the General &apos;s unsuccessful attempt to force America to its knees by selling dollars for gold . 
The 1960 &apos;s ended in the breakdown of the &quot; system , &quot; and in major financial turbulence , accompanied by an inflationary surge of commodity prices . 
Everyone was hurt , and America &apos;s role in world affairs was shaken . 
A similar collapse now is likely to have a rather different effect . 
The floating-rate system of today is stronger and the costs of adjustment differently distributed . 
Most Americans do not suffer greatly from the dollar &apos;s sharp fall , as foreign sellers have to make price adjustments for the US market . 
Asian economies are growing vigorously , and their central banks are building up claims on the US . 
They are likely to continue this policy , as the alternative would be a sudden setback to the competitiveness of their export sectors in the all-important US market . 
This gives the US a longer time to address a current account deficit that is in the long run unsustainable . 
The economically dynamic regions of the world - North America and Asia - are thus linked together in a pact that will ensure the continued centrality of the American dollar . 
Americans will continue to pile up debt because Asians want them to do that . 
To abrogate the pact would be against the interest of both parties . 
This is not American unilateralism , because it means working with Asia . 
But to Europeans , who are excluded from the pact , it looks like monetary and economic unilateralism . 
In the meantime , the rise of the euro against the dollar creates substantial European pain for manufacturing exporters . 
Europe , however , is unable to do much to gain relief . 
Indeed , Europe will be the major sufferer in the new currency clashes . 
Answers that were touted in the 1960 &apos;s - revival of the gold standard , or the invention of a common European currency - do not appear to be very helpful any more . 
Having a single currency has turned out not to afford substantial protection . 
The old version of the European response - what psychologists might call &quot; dollar envy &quot;  - will only become more acute . 
There will be appeals to the European Central Bank to expand the monetary base , as if imitating the dollar were the answer to all the industrial , structural , and demographic problems plaguing Europe . 
But a moment &apos;s reflection should remind us that Europe &apos;s problems are not amenable to currency manipulation . 
Protesting the new version of America &apos;s exorbitant monetary privilege should be seen for what it is : a way of compensating for a real European powerlessness . 
So dollar envy is here to stay , and it will become even greater as the greenback &apos;s international value melts away without any obviously bad effects on the people who print and use it .
