What Should Yahoo ! 
NEW YORK - Many people think that Yahoo ! is as good as dead : investors have driven the stock down almost 20 % since its recent deal with Microsoft . 
But I think the company is now in a stronger position to stake out new ground , rather than fight with Google over stale turf . 
Leave that to Microsoft . 
Now that Yahoo ! has freed itself from its fight with Google , it can return to its roots as a directory company that helped users to make sense of the world around them . 
Indeed , back in 1994 , Yahoo ! started with a team of editors who combed through the small amount of information that was then online and generated lists of the best content , complete with links . 
Google showed up with an automated tool to search for content - any content - and Yahoo ! used that service before developing its own search capability . 
But the world has changed . 
The problem now is not finding information ; it &apos;s filtering it and structuring it . 
TMI - too much information - has become a recognized acronym . 
You can &apos;t rely on human editors to structure information anymore ; you need automated tools , augmented by human expertise and specific domain knowledge . 
But search alone doesn &apos;t work , either : search is like a flashlight in a dark room ; it pinpoints one or two things but leaves the surrounding space murky . 
What people really want is a lighted room , with things displayed neatly on labeled shelves . 
That &apos;s what Microsoft has done with Bing , in a few commercially oriented domains . 
But the opportunity goes beyond the world of shopping , to all the stuff out there that Google helps you find ( and that is so enticing but ultimately limited as a business proposition ) . 
Yahoo ! &quot; s biggest opportunity lies within its half-billion registered users &quot; own possessions and habits , their photos and friendships and electronic data that is now becoming sufficiently extensive and complex to need management . 
This is Yahoo ! &quot; s opportunity - to make sense of the world to individuals . 
Several existing companies are leading the way , but they are not as trusted as Yahoo ! ; nor do they have the large user base that will enable Yahoo ! to extend saving and managing to sharing , so that users can see their own data in the context of others . &quot; 
People spend a fair amount of time searching for new stuff , but in many cases they would like to relate it to old stuff - specifically , to their own information . 
There &apos;s a diffuse but gradually sharpening trend for people to manage their own information online - not just their finances at Mint or Wesabe , but also their book preferences at Amazon , cellphone records ( Skydeck ) , physical activities ( Nike , Garmin , and the like ) , friendships and friends &quot; activities ( Facebook / Friendfeed and others ) , travel ( Dopplr and TripIt ) , health ( Polka.com ) , music ( iTunes , IHeardItOn , etc . ) , and so forth . 
Searching the Internet gets you to places where you can book travel , buy music , find walking paths , and trade stocks , but these sites are generally not where users can aggregate , manage and analyze their own content and data . 
Yahoo ! can become that place . 
What does this mean from a business point of view ? 
Freed from the distraction of the search-engine wars , the company can focus on making the entire Yahoo ! experience more consistent and integrated . 
Internally , it needs to combine its services more closely . It has already provided a single log-on for all its services , including Yahoo ! 
Mail and acquisitions such as Upcoming ( events ) , Flickr ( photos and video ) . 
Its new home page makes it easy for a user to assemble a variety of services in one place . 
Yahoo ! is open enough to offer such third-party sources as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal , but even its own services generally provide only generic content around , say , health care and stocks , rather than the ability to manage one &apos;s own health data or stock portfolio . 
This raises another issue : call it transparency or call it privacy . 
Yahoo ! and a number of other companies - including Google - are already working on a standard for displaying information about the advertisements a user sees : Yahoo ! &quot; s edge is that it can show this information without embarrassment . 
It shows ads from third parties to its users , but it does not sell their data to anyone else . 
In a world where users worry about - and regulators legislate against - the tracking of users , Yahoo ! doesn &apos;t have to follow its users across the Web . It knows enough about them , openly , from what they do on Yahoo ! 
Users can specify how much of their travel plans , for example , they want to share - all the details with family and colleagues , or all the places they have been to with everyone -after the fact . 
I &apos;d be happy to share my travel plans with , say , British Airways if I thought they would give me a good deal . 
Its users know what Yahoo ! knows about them : not a record of all the sites they visited , but their behavior on Yahoo ! and , potentially , their data . 
But it &apos;s the user , not Yahoo ! , who can make the decision about what to share with British Airways . 
For those who care , this is a big deal ; for those who don &apos;t , they will know only that Yahoo ! has a good record for two-way disclosure . 
To fulfill this broad promise , Yahoo ! should now either buy or build a variety of services that help users manage their own data . 
The services described would be a good start , but there are many more , and Yahoo ! has the tools and the audience to build some of its own . 
None of this will be easy . 
It could almost be as complex as designing a search engine . 
But it would be worth it . After all , for many people , the most fascinating thing in the world is a mirror .
