Israel &apos;s Lonely Prosperity 
PARIS - It is difficult not to be struck by the contrast between the &quot; Asian &quot; -like energy of Israel &apos;s economy and civil society and the purely defensive nature of its approach to political change , both within and outside the country . 
A recent law bars Israeli citizens from supporting Western boycotts aimed at reversing the country &apos;s settlement policies and at backing an independent Palestinian state . 
While Israel has never been so affluent , dynamic , and confident , it also has never been so isolated internationally . 
Israel could have embraced the Arab Spring as an opportunity , rather than as a profound risk . 
If Arab citizens could transform their culture of humiliation into a culture of hope , perhaps they would be able to reconcile themselves with Israel &apos;s existence . 
In their estimation , a complex regional environment has now become even more dangerous , making prudence even more urgent . 
For Israel , yesterday &apos;s despots , like Egypt &apos;s former president , Hosni Mubarak , were much more predictable than the &quot; Arab masses . &quot; 
While some of the demonstrators might be inspired by democratic ideals , let &apos;s have no illusions , the Israelis seem to be saying : Islamist forces will emerge as the only winners , and they are much more hostile to Israel and the West than their predecessors were . 
Of course , with the Syrian regime &apos;s massacres of its own citizens , some in Israel say that the suffering of Gaza &apos;s inhabitants pales in comparison , and thus fails to attract the same sympathy as it did last year . 
One of the more ironic results of the region &apos;s changing political configuration is that Israel now perceives a strategic convergence with Saudi Arabia . 
Despite their political systems &quot; deep differences , they both favor the regional status quo , and they share an obsessive suspicion of Iran . 
But why not dream of a new strategic triangle comprising Israel , Saudi Arabia , and Turkey , just as Israelis once dreamed of a non-Arab triangle between Israel , Turkey , and the Shah &apos;s Iran ? 
The Turks &quot; appalled reaction to the Syrian regime &apos;s brutal behavior creates an opportunity that Israel should use to try to restore the privileged relationship with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan &apos;s government that existed before the Gaza blockade . 
Israel &apos;s leaders seem intent on gaining time both tactically , by resisting the soft pressure of US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration , and strategically , by preparing the country for a new world in which emerging powers such as China play an increasingly important role . 
That world , however , will be one in which Israel can no longer count on feelings of Holocaust guilt to influence major powers . 
Israel may be &quot; of Europe , &quot; and its main ally may well remain the United States for many years to come , but Israeli leaders must start thinking of how their country can thrive in a post-Western world . 
The most recent &quot; President &apos;s Conference , &quot; held in June in Jerusalem under the patronage of Israeli President Shimon Peres , was highly symbolic of this evolution . 
In the opening session , Obama &apos;s special envoy , Denis Ross , was greeted with resounding silence when he conveyed to the participants his boss &apos;s warm wishes . 
By contrast , China &apos;s culture minister was welcomed very warmly when he spoke , in typical fashion , of the growing need for global &quot; harmony . &quot; 
In the minds of a few Israeli strategic thinkers , Israel must resist firmly for two or three more generations in order to become an irreversible reality in the region and a legitimate &quot; accomplished fact &quot; of the international system . 
At that point , who would want to boycott a country whose technological prowess is needed all over the world ? 
In this context , the idea of a peace settlement with the Palestinians seems more abstract than ever . 
Indeed , it makes the current status quo seem comfortable . 
The gap between Israel &apos;s rich and poor nowadays may recall Brazil , but who remembers the original Zionists &quot; social-democratic ideals ? 
The country &apos;s prosperity is simply overwhelming . 
From Tel Aviv to Jerusalem , luxurious penthouses are multiplying . 
Are we in Singapore , Hong Kong , or São Paulo ? 
Why challenge the certainties of the present with the uncertainties of the future ? 
Moreover , Israel has not only become much more prosperous ; it has also moved decisively to the right . 
The second Intifada may very well have proven fatal to the Israeli left . 
Triumphant capitalism , idolatry of the land , and the comforts of the status quo produce a heady cocktail .
