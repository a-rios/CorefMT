The Misrule of Law 
MADRID - Once upon a time , despots simply acted like despots . 
Nowadays , they dress up their dictatorships in the trappings of the rule of law . 
Consider Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych . 
Less than a year after his narrow victory over opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko in the 2010 presidential elections , Tymoshenko was arrested on trumped-up contempt charges . 
She is now serving a seven-year prison sentence for supposedly abusing her position as Prime Minister by signing a gas deal with Russia - and awaits the completion of two more trials . 
Unlike most politically motivated trials , Tymoshenko &apos;s case benefits from the oversight of the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) , which recently ruled that her pre-trial detention violated the European Convention on Human Rights . 
But Yanukovych continues to feign respect for the rule of law , insisting that he cannot consider granting her a presidential pardon until the legal proceedings have been concluded . 
This type of &quot; misrule of law &quot; is not unique to Ukraine . 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has consistently used the courts to neutralize his opponents . 
Currently , the anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny , a prominent critic of Putin &apos;s regime , is being prosecuted for allegedly conspiring to embezzle from a state-owned timber firm , while Sergei Magnitsky , a lawyer who died in prison after accusing several Russian officials of large-scale embezzlement , is being tried posthumously on conspiracy charges . 
Similarly , opposition leaders in Zimbabwe have been prosecuted for treason ; sodomy charges were leveled against the Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim ; and former Belarusian presidential candidate Andrei Sannikov was imprisoned for allegedly organizing mass protests . 
Iran pursued mass prosecutions of government critics following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s controversial reelection in 2009 , and it now appears that some of Ahmadinejad &apos;s allies may themselves become collateral damage in his conflict with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei , facing politically motivated criminal trials . 
Of course , history is replete with examples of autocrats perverting justice : Stalin had his Moscow Trials , and Hitler had his People &apos;s Court . 
But the authority of those dictators did not rest primarily on the rule of law ; that of their modern counterparts does . 
The sociologist Max Weber described three bases of authority : traditional , charismatic , and rational ( legal ) . 
The first has fallen away , its accompanying social structures superseded by industrialization , urbanization , and feminization of the workforce , while the oft-seen link with despotism has delegitimized the second . 
As a result , legality has emerged as the main source of political legitimacy in the modern world . 
Consequently , those who are more interested in arbitrary authority than legality are using the language of law to legitimize their actions - and weakening the rule of law in the process . 
Barely a week after prosecutors accused Tymoshenko - based , yet again , on mere hearsay - of organizing the 1996 assassination of a member of parliament , Yanukovych proclaimed : &quot; Our goal is to ensure real economic and political independence , strengthen democracy and the rule of law , and establish Ukraine as &#91; a &#93; young , powerful , and modern state . &quot; 
This disturbingly common disconnect between official words and deeds devalues the rule of law in the eyes of the public . 
Two separate discussions about the rule of law are currently underway : an erudite , theoretical debate among elites at think tanks and universities , and a more general - and more consequential - popular &quot; conversation &quot; predicated on frustration with legal abuses . 
From southern Europe to Malaysia and China , citizens are taking to the streets to demonstrate their desire for equity and justice . 
They may not be able to define the rule of law precisely , but they know when it is being perverted . 
In countries with an engaged civil society and room for debate , the discourse on the rule of law can be wide-ranging and substantive . 
Too often , however , governments ignore or distort public aspirations , stripping the discussion of all but officially approved platitudes . 
In order to reverse this trend , a third discussion , one that engages the international community , is needed . 
While such a discussion is beginning to emerge in response to the Tymoshenko case , the ECHR is a lonely voice , and the international community has so far hesitated to challenge violations of the rule of law publicly . 
At the same time , some institutions that could provide effective international oversight have been coopted , as demonstrated by Libya &apos;s leadership of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights while under the control of deposed dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi . 
And others have been far too willing to accept at face value submissions from countries where the rule of law is routinely abused . 
For example , while Interpol recently rejected Russia &apos;s request to pursue the investment banker William F. Browder ( a fierce critic of the Russian government since the death of his lawyer , Magnitsky ) , it should apply Article 3 of its constitution , which bars it from participating in political matters , much more scrupulously . 
The response to legal abuses has often been timid or declaratory , carried out by individual countries or communities like the European Union in response to specific violations . 
For example , the United States recently banned 18 Russian officials , most of whom were allegedly linked to Magnitsky &apos;s death , from traveling to the US and froze all assets that they hold there . 
But , while unilateral pressure can make a difference , the rule of law &apos;s defenders must be willing to apply it convincingly . 
The EU &apos;s talks with Ukraine on a proposed Association Agreement , for example , provide some leverage , which the EU should not hesitate to use . 
At the same time , the potential impact of targeted action by individual governments is not enough . 
Protection of the rule of law must become an international priority - and that will require strong leadership . 
The EU - which was not only founded on the rule of law , but is also among its most vocal defenders in its diplomatic relationships - should fill this role . 
Beyond the ECHR and its rulings in cases like that of Tymoshenko , a strong European voice would go a long way toward galvanizing broader international action .
