Understanding Global Competitiveness 
This month the World Economic Forum and the Harvard Center for International Development issued the Global Competitiveness Report for 2001 . 
Finland , the US , and Canada ranked first through third among the 75 countries studied , while Nicaragua , Nigeria , and Zimbabwe ranked in the last three places . 
As a co-director of this annual study , I am often asked what competitiveness actually means . 
Do countries really compete economically , in the way that they do militarily ? 
Does it make sense to say that Finland is more competitive than , say , Germany or Italy ? 
For purposes of our report , we define competitiveness in a precise way : as a country &apos;s capacity to achieve sustained economic growth in the medium term - ie , five-years time . 
In defining competitiveness we are not claiming that one country &apos;s competitiveness means another country &apos;s lack of competitiveness . 
With better policies all countries in the world could simultaneously achieve higher growth . 
Even so , it does make sense to rank countries regarding their capacity to achieve growth . 
Each country is interested in knowing whether its policies and institutions stack up against those of other nations in the capacity to achieve and sustain economic growth . 
There are aspects of growth that are like head-to-head competition , in which the gains of one country or region can be at the expense of another country or region . 
Countries compete for internationally mobile capital . 
The more one country reaps in foreign direct investment , the less investment another country can attract . 
This is clear when countries compete for an individual investment project . 
When Intel plans a new semiconductor plant , it invites bids from various countries . 
The competition is fierce to attract the project , and usually involves tax breaks , commitments on infrastructure , and even promises about the engineering curriculum in the local university . 
In this year &apos;s rankings , we determined a country &apos;s competitiveness ( the capacity to grow ) according to three broad criteria : ( 1 ) technology ; ( 2 ) public institutions ; and ( 3 ) macroeconomic stability . 
Indexes were created in each of these categories and then averaged in a specific manner to create an overall Growth Competitiveness Index . 
Technology refers to the ability of the country to spur new inventions and to adopt technologies invented in other countries . 
Some countries , like the US , Japan , Korea , Israel , and Sweden , invest heavily in research and development , and so achieve high rates of innovation . 
Other countries , like Argentina and Brazil , invest less in research and development , and therefore achieve little in the way of new products and processes . 
Innovators enjoy a high level of prosperity as the result of their innovations . 
Here the US , Canada , and Finland rank 1st through 3rd . 
Public institutions refer to the quality of governance . 
Is there widespread corruption ? 
Are courts honest and impartial in their judgments ? 
Can governments be trusted to follow through on their commitments ? 
Countries with well-functioning public institutions achieve higher rates of economic growth than do countries plagued by corruption and rotten judges . 
High ethical standards promote better economic performance . 
Northern Europe stands at the top of the world in this regard , with Finland , Iceland , and Denmark ranking 1st through 3rd . 
Corruption is deemed nearly non-existent in these countries . 
Macroeconomic stability refers to the absence of inflation , budget balance , a realistic value for the exchange rate , the ability of businesses and government to obtain market loans , and high confidence that government financial obligations will be honored . 
We have learned in the past decade that even when businesses are internationally competitive , a macroeconomic crisis can derail economic growth , as it did in most of Asia in the late 1990s . 
Singapore , Ireland , and Switzerland are the three top-ranked countries in macroeconomic stability . 
In our competitiveness studies , we noticed that the world economy can be divided into two categories of countries : the innovators and the non-innovators . 
Only about 20 countries in the world are active creators of new inventions . 
For these countries , which tend to be among the world &apos;s richest , continued competitiveness requires an excellent system of technological innovation . 
Universities must be excellent , government laboratories should be world class , and government and industry should be investing heavily in research and development . 
A key determinant of future growth among these economies is the proportion of students that go on to higher education after high-school graduation . 
This proportion is now around 80 % of students in Canada and the US . 
For &quot; non-innovators , &quot; technology remains important , but in these countries most new technologies are imported from abroad rather than invented at home . 
Some of these countries are good at importing new technologies , and others are not . 
For the past decade or more , a great deal of technological imports came in the context of foreign direct investment . 
When American firms invested heavily in Mexico , or Taiwanese firms invested heavily in mainland China , the firms brought with them new technologies that upgraded the production efficiency of the host economy . 
So it made sense for countries to compete vigorously for such foreign investors : they offer not only capital , but also new technologies . 
A strength and weakness of our analysis of competitiveness is that it focuses on the medium term , not the coming year or two . 
Our rankings cannot be used to assess short run cyclical conditions in an economy , but do provide insights into the longer-term prospects of major economies . 
Thus , it is ironic that many of this year &apos;s leaders in competitiveness , such as the U S and Singapore , are in recession , while countries further down the list , like China ( 39th ) , will escape the global recession . 
Part of the slowdown relates to the terrorist attacks of September 11th , but it is becoming clear that America &apos;s economy , and other economies linked to the US through trade and production networks , were sliding into recession before September . 
Still , our best guess is that this cyclical downturn will prove temporary , and that on a five-year perspective , the US will continue to demonstrate a strong capacity to achieve economic growth .
