Consolidators versus Stimulators 
LONDON - All intellectual systems rely on assumptions that do not need to be spelled out because all members of that particular intellectual community accept them . 
These &quot; deep &quot; axioms are implicit in economics as well , but , if left unscrutinized , they can steer policymakers into a blind alley . 
That is what is happening in today &apos;s effort , in country after country , to slash spending and bring down budget deficits . 
The chief task that John Maynard Keynes set himself in writing his General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money was to uncover the deep axioms underlying the economic orthodoxy of his day , which assumed away the possibility of persistent mass unemployment . 
The question he asked of his opponents was : &quot; What must they believe in order to claim that persistent mass unemployment is impossible , so that government &quot; stimulus &quot; to raise the employment level could do no good ? &quot; 
In answering this question , Keynes reconstructed the orthodox theory - and then proceeded to demolish it . 
Today , despite the Keynesian revolution , the same question demands an answer . 
What do people who demand rapid &quot; fiscal consolidation &quot; amid heavy unemployment need to believe about the economy to make their policy coherent ? 
This question is not trivial , because the fiscal hair shirt has become the favored article of policy clothing among those who now dictate economic affairs . 
Prestigious bodies like the G-20 , the IMF , and the OECD join the &quot; markets &quot; and economic columnists in demanding that governments liquidate their deficits . 
Any other course , they say , spells disaster ; balancing budgets as soon as possible is the only way back to prosperity . 
A few Keynesian economists stand against this stampede to retrenchment - Paul Krugman , Joseph Stiglitz , and Brad DeLong in the United States ; 
Martin Wolf , Samuel Brittan , Danny Blanchflower , and I in the UK ; and Paul de Grauwe and Jean-Paul Fitoussi in continental Europe . 
Indeed , all Western governments , with the exception of the Obama administration , are committed to retrenchment - and Obama cannot get a new stimulus package through Congress . 
The question is : what must the cutters and slashers believe to justify their policies ? 
When I ask this question , I never get a coherent answer ; so let me retrace Keynes &apos;s steps . 
The first of the implicit assumptions of orthodox theory that Keynes identified was Say &apos;s Law , the doctrine that &quot; supply creates its own demand . &quot; 
This means that all money earned is bound to be spent , and therefore that at no point in time could there be a &quot; general glut &quot; of commodities . 
Keynes pointed out the fallacy here : while the income derived from production is , by definition , equal to the value of production , it does not follow that all this income will be spent . 
Some part of it may be &quot; hoarded , &quot; in which case demand may fall short of supply . 
Specifically , Keynes denied that saving is simply deferred spending . 
In a well-known passage , he wrote : &quot; An act of saving means ... a decision not to have dinner today . 
But it does not necessitate a decision to have dinner or to buy a pair of boots a week hence ... Thus it depresses the business of preparing today &apos;s dinner without stimulating the business of making ready for some future act of consumption . &quot; 
&quot; Getting to that realization , &quot; says Krugman , &quot; was an awesome intellectual achievement . &quot; 
Yet Say &apos;s Law is alive and well among new classical macroeconomists like John Cochrane and Eugene Fama . 
It amounts to claiming that the factors of production will always be fully employed , and that , in Cochrane &apos;s words , &quot; if the government borrows a dollar from you , that is a dollar that you do not spend , or that you do not lend to a company to spend on new investment . &quot; 
The second classical postulate Keynes identified was that the &quot; real wage is equal to the marginal disutility of labor . &quot; 
This means that , in a competitive labor market , real wages will always be instantly adjusted to changes in conditions of demand . 
In other words , there can never be involuntary , or unwanted , unemployment . 
Keynes denied that real wages are set in the labor market . 
Workers bargain for money wages , and a reduction in their money incomes might leave total demand too low to employ all those willing to work . 
This reinforces the idea that &quot; stimulus &quot; cannot do any good , since workers have as much employment as they want . 
Keynes thought that the chief implicit assumption underlying the classical theory of the economy was that of perfect knowledge . 
&quot; Risks , &quot; he wrote , &quot; were supposed to be capable of an exact actuarial computation . 
The calculus of probability ... was supposed to be capable of reducing uncertainty to the same calculable status as certainty itself ... &quot; 
For Keynes , this is untenable : &quot; Actually ... we have as a rule only the vaguest idea of any but the most direct consequences of our acts . &quot; 
This made investment , which is always a bet on the future , dependent on fluctuating states of confidence . 
Financial markets , through which investment is made , were always liable to collapse when something happened to disturb business confidence . 
Therefore , market economies were inherently unstable . 
Today &apos;s &quot; efficient market theory &quot; restored to economics the assumption of perfect knowledge by claiming that all risks are correctly priced . 
This means that the &quot; underpricing of risk worldwide , &quot; which Alan Greenspan identified as the root cause of the banking collapse of 2007-08 , is impossible . 
Yet it happened . 
The classical view of the economy , which Keynes set out to demolish , is not only alive , but in recent years has been dominant , feeding the belief that competitive markets can be left to regulate themselves , will always provide as much employment as is wanted , and are immune to large-scale collapse . 
This also fuels opposition to government intervention , and to &quot; stimulus &quot; policies , which are supposedly redundant , if not harmful , since the events that require them cannot happen ( but do ) . 
Unless we start discussing economics in a Keynesian framework , we are doomed to a succession of crises and recessions . 
If we don &apos;t , the next one will come sooner than we think .
