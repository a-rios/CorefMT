The Climate Extremists 
COPENHAGEN - Extreme weather is often said to be one of the main reasons for taking firm action on global warming . 
Nowadays , no hurricane or heat wave passes without a politician or activist claiming it as evidence of the need for a global climate deal , like the one that just got postponed until the end of the decade in Durban , South Africa . 
Such claims merit close scrutiny . 
In 2007 , the United Nations &quot; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) released a report on climate extremes that received considerable media attention . 
But , two years later , it was discovered that some of the IPCC report &apos;s key claims - for example , that global warming would cause the immense Himalayan glaciers to disappear by 2035 , or halve African crop yields by 2020 - were based on statements made in appeals by environmentalist organizations , and were backed by little or no evidence . 
Despite this error , the IPCC has long been a fairly reliable source of sensible and responsible estimates in an otherwise histrionic debate . 
Unfortunately , sensible estimates are not breaking news . 
For example , according to the IPCC , sea levels will rise by a relatively manageable 18-59 centimeters ( 7-23 inches ) by the end of the century , whereas news organizations and activists regularly claim that we should expect sea levels to rise by meters . 
The media similarly misrepresented the findings of the IPCC &apos;s 2010 report on climate extremes . 
Sweden &apos;s most prestigious daily newspaper , Svenske Dagbladet , filled almost an entire Sunday front page with an eviscerated body showing exposed arteries , adorned with the warning : &quot; Ever warmer climate threatens more death . &quot; 
Across two full pages inside , the paper presented a graph of seasonal deaths over the past decade , and indicated with alarming red spots how summer heat waves have killed dozens of Swedes . 
Yet , even a cursory reading of the graph showed clearly that many more people die from cold than from heat . 
The IPCC report did indeed state that global warming would mean more extreme warm temperatures , but it also pointed to fewer extreme cold temperatures . 
Because more people almost everywhere on the planet die each year from cold temperatures than from warm temperatures , the overall impact of global warming will be fewer deaths from temperature extremes . 
Indeed , according to one estimate , by mid-century , about 400,000 more people will die from heat than would have perished at current temperatures , but 1.8 million fewer people will die from cold . 
Unfortunately , non-deaths are a non-story . 
In November , The Christian Science Monitor focused on the IPCC &apos;s findings on hurricanes , the strength and frequency of which have been linked to global warming ever since former US Vice President Al Gore &apos;s film An Inconvenient Truth made media hay out of Hurricane Katrina . 
The Monitor &apos;s headline blared : &quot; Climate change warning : brace for hotter heat waves , stronger storms . &quot; 
Yet , while the IPCC suggests that hurricanes &quot; maximum wind speeds will most likely increase , it also predicts that the total number of tropical hurricanes may fall , and that extra-tropical hurricanes will most likely decline in frequency , too . 
The IPCC clearly states that hurricane-damage costs have increased steadily because more people , with more expensive property , now live where hurricanes strike . 
Population , exposure , and vulnerability , not greenhouse gasses , are the main factors underlying future damage as well . 
Indeed , the IPCC observes that increased hurricane costs &quot; have not been attributed to climate change . &quot; 
Thus , if we want to avoid future hurricane damage , we need to invest in adaptation . 
That means better risk management , including stricter building codes and improved wetlands to slow storm surges . 
Considerable evidence does suggest that global warming causes increases in rain , especially heavy rain . 
That has led many observers to blame global warming for devastating floods in Pakistan , Australia , and Thailand in recent years . 
But the IPCC tells a different story : the evidence cannot even reliably indicate whether increased precipitation has , in fact , affected the floods &quot; magnitude and frequency ( in UN-speak , &quot; low confidence at the global scale regarding even the sign of these changes &quot; ) . 
That may sound counter-intuitive . 
But much more important changes have taken place : in particular , construction of dams and large settlements on floodplains has left rivers nowhere to flood naturally . 
If we want to help potential flood victims , the evidence clearly shows that we should restore floodplains . 
Increased precipitation also has positive consequences - most significantly , more fresh water for a thirsty world . 
Today , about two billion people are water-stressed , meaning that they make do on less than 1,700 cubic meters ( 60,035 cubic feet ) per year . 
Population growth alone suggests that this number could increase to about three billion towards the end of the century . 
But more precipitation from global warming will most likely bring the actual number down to about 1.7 billion . 
Scary climate stories rely on a simple narrative : more CO2 means more environmental damage and death - and the only way to address it is to cut carbon emissions . 
While this makes for a catchy political message , it has the distinct disadvantage of being wrong . 
Global warming will cause certain phenomena , such as heat waves and hurricane wind speeds , to become more extreme , while others , including cold waves and hurricane frequency , will become less so . 
And , in some cases , such as increasing precipitation , global warming will have both positive and negative effects . 
Of course , none of this means that we should not address climate change by focusing on innovation to make for less costly green energy . 
The latest IPCC report is important precisely because it illustrates the real environmental problems posed by global warming , without exaggerating them for the sake of a good headline . 
It provides reliable climate information , and emphasizes that adaptation is essential to improving future generations &quot; quality of life . 
It also shows why the latest failure to conclude a comprehensive climate deal is not all bad news . 
But , when it comes to climate change , the media evidently do not like any other kind .
