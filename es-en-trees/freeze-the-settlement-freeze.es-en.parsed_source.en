Freeze the Settlement Freeze 
RAMALLAH - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s decision to approve new Jewish settlements on the eve of a possible settlement freeze is the latest round in a cycle that has been repeated so many times over the past 40 years that it would seem mundane if it were not so dangerous . 
The cycle goes something like this : American or international pressure mounts on Israel to stop settlement activities in the occupied territories . 
Israeli settlers and their supporters then gather even more energy to expand onto more Palestinian land , build more exclusively Jewish settlements , and destroy more Arab homes before the so-called &quot; freeze &quot; comes into effect . 
The peace process , not surprisingly , becomes a joke while this happens . 
Eventually , world pressure subsides and the freeze fails to materialize . 
In the end , more Jewish settlements appear . 
Indeed , the great paradox of this cycle is that more settlements are built during times of negotiations than during times of conflict . 
This pattern can be traced to 1967 . 
Israelis understand that the only reality in politics is the reality on the ground . 
So long as Israeli soldiers control the occupied territories , the idea of a settlement freeze will not take root . 
In fact , the demand for a settlement freeze is nothing more than a call to arms to a wide group of Israelis and their supporters to go and build on stolen Palestinian land . 
When Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was preparing for his historic visit to Jerusalem , a group of settlers created the settlement of Elon Moreh near Nablus , the most populated West Bank city . 
When former United States Secretary of State James Baker began his shuttle diplomacy for peace , his ultimately unsuccessful efforts actually resulted in more settlements , with a new one started just hours before he was due to arrive for talks . 
Baker postponed his visit and later vented his frustrations to the US Senate Committee on Appropriations . 
He resented &quot; being greeted &quot; every time he came to the Middle East with yet &quot; another settlement . &quot; 
Baker &apos;s efforts eventually led to the Madrid peace conference in 1991 , but that , too , failed to resolve the conflict . 
And , while Palestinians and Israelis did reach a secret agreement a few years later that was publicly declared at a White House ceremony , construction of Jewish settlements didn &apos;t stop . 
In fact , since the 1993 Oslo Accords the number of Jewish settlers in the occupied territories has doubled . 
The creation of new settlements has often been accompanied by hostile media reporting - even within Israel - as well as international condemnation , yet the settlement train has not stopped . 
It continued to race ahead even during the days when Israel &apos;s government rotated between Likud &apos;s Yitzhak Shamir and Labor &apos;s Shimon Peres between 1984 and 1990 . 
The Shamir government would be defeated at the polls , and the incoming Labor government would declare a freeze on all settlement construction , even on buildings that had already been started . 
But , despite the decrees , ways were found to continue building , to absorb new residents , and to increase the settler population . 
For the US , the settlements have proven to be an equal-opportunity obstacle , obstructing both Republican and Democratic diplomacy . 
The Clinton administration attempted to put brakes on then-Prime Minister Netanyahu &apos;s efforts to construct a new settlement near Bethlehem . 
After a short hiatus , construction resumed . 
The Bush-Cheney Administration , the most pro-Israeli in memory , fared no better . 
Today , Har Homa , built on Jabal Abu Ghnaim with the aim of cutting off Bethlehem from Jerusalem , is home to 19,000 settlers . 
This cycle has become so bizarre and confusing that Palestinians are not sure whether they should hope for continued tensions with Israel ( which usually means no new settlements ) or for continued negotiations ( which usually provide cover for building settlements ) . 
On January 5 , 2007 , the day Prime Minister Ehud Olmert met with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to discuss a new round of talks , the Israeli Construction and Housing Ministry issued a tender for the construction of more units in Ma &apos;ale Adumim , an exclusively Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank . 
Of course , whenever the Israelis defy the world over the settlements , as is now once again happening , US and other officials &quot; denounce &quot; and &quot; regret &quot; the decision . 
But , at the end of the day , despite these few statements and perhaps even a UN resolution of opposition , the pattern established over the past 40 years is clear : the decision stands . 
Jeff Aronson , a senior researcher at the Washington-based Foundation for Middle East Peace , concludes that Israeli leaders will continue to be able to fool their American counterparts on this issue . 
Some Israeli right-wing leaders like Menachem Begin , Shamir , and Netanyahu trumpet their settlement achievements . 
Others , including Yitzhak Rabin , Ehud Barak , and Ehud Olmert &quot; talked left and built right . &quot; 
Palestinians are caught in a Catch-22 : if they insist on a settlement freeze , Israel preemptively begins to build new settlements . 
Unless and until Israel pays a heavy price for its illegal activities in the occupied territories , it is hard to imagine a successful peace process taking shape .
