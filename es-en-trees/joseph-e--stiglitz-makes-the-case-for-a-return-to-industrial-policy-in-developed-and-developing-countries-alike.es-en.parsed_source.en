Creating a Learning Society 
NEW YORK - Citizens in the world &apos;s richest countries have come to think of their economies as being based on innovation . 
But innovation has been part of the developed world &apos;s economy for more than two centuries . 
Indeed , for thousands of years , until the Industrial Revolution , incomes stagnated . 
Then per capita income soared , increasing year after year , interrupted only by the occasional effects of cyclical fluctuations . 
The Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow noted some 60 years ago that rising incomes should largely be attributed not to capital accumulation , but to technological progress - to learning how to do things better . 
While some of the productivity increase reflects the impact of dramatic discoveries , much of it has been due to small , incremental changes . 
And , if that is the case , it makes sense to focus attention on how societies learn , and what can be done to promote learning - including learning how to learn . 
A century ago , the economist and political scientist Joseph Schumpeter argued that the central virtue of a market economy was its capacity to innovate . 
He contended that economists &quot; traditional focus on competitive markets was misplaced ; what mattered was competition for the market , not competition in the market . 
Competition for the market drove innovation . 
A succession of monopolists would lead , in this view , to higher standards of living in the long run . 
Schumpeter &apos;s conclusions have not gone unchallenged . 
Monopolists and dominant firms , like Microsoft , can actually suppress innovation . 
Unless checked by anti-trust authorities , they can engage in anti-competitive behavior that reinforces their monopoly power . 
Moreover , markets may not be efficient in either the level or direction of investments in research and learning . 
Private incentives are not well aligned with social returns : firms can gain from innovations that increase their market power , enable them to circumvent regulations , or channel rents that would otherwise accrue to others . 
But one of Schumpeter &apos;s fundamental insights has held up well : Conventional policies focusing on short-run efficiency may not be desirable , once one takes a long-run innovation / learning perspective . 
This is especially true for developing countries and emerging markets . 
Industrial policies - in which governments intervene in the allocation of resources among sectors or favor some technologies over others - can help &quot; infant economies &quot; learn . 
Learning may be more marked in some sectors ( such as industrial manufacturing ) than in others , and the benefits of that learning , including the institutional development required for success , may spill over to other economic activities . 
Such policies , when adopted , have been frequent targets of criticism . 
Government , it is often said , should not be engaged in picking winners . 
The market is far better in making such judgments . 
But the evidence on that is not as compelling as free-market advocates claim . 
America &apos;s private sector was notoriously bad in allocating capital and managing risk in the years before the global financial crisis , while studies show that average returns to the economy from government research projects are actually higher than those from private-sector projects - especially because the government invests more heavily in important basic research . 
One only needs to think of the social benefits traceable to the research that led to the development of the Internet or the discovery of DNA . 
But , putting such successes aside , the point of industrial policy is not to pick winners at all . 
Rather , successful industrial policies identify sources of positive externalities - sectors where learning might generate benefits elsewhere in the economy . 
Viewing economic policies through the lens of learning provides a different perspective on many issues . 
The great economist Kenneth Arrow emphasized the importance of learning by doing . 
The only way to learn what is required for industrial growth , for example , is to have industry . 
And that may require either ensuring that one &apos;s exchange rate is competitive or that certain industries have privileged access to credit - as a number of East Asian countries did as part of their remarkably successful development strategies . 
There is a compelling infant economy argument for industrial protection . 
Moreover , financial-market liberalization may undermine countries &quot; ability to learn another set of skills that are essential for development : how to allocate resources and manage risk . 
Likewise , intellectual property , if not designed properly , can be a two-edged sword when viewed from a learning perspective . 
While it may enhance incentives to invest in research , it may also enhance incentives for secrecy - impeding the flow of knowledge that is essential to learning while encouraging firms to maximize what they draw from the pool of collective knowledge and to minimize what they contribute . 
In this scenario , the pace of innovation is actually reduced . 
More broadly , many of the policies ( especially those associated with the neoliberal &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; ) foisted on developing countries with the noble objective of promoting the efficiency of resource allocation today actually impede learning , and thus lead to lower standards of living in the long run . 
Virtually every government policy , intentionally or not , for better or for worse , has direct and indirect effects on learning . 
Developing countries where policymakers are cognizant of these effects are more likely to close the knowledge gap that separates them from the more developed countries . 
Developed countries , meanwhile , have an opportunity to narrow the gap between average and best practices , and to avoid the danger of secular stagnation .
