Obama and Iran 
NEW YORK - While talking to an Iranian official in Tehran earlier this year , he reminded me of Ayatollah Khomeini &apos;s fondness for comparing the relationship between the United States and Iran to that between a wolf and a lamb . 
But the official went on to add his own twist , &quot; Nearly 30 years have passed , and we are not that lamb anymore , and maybe the US is not the same wolf it once was . &quot; 
His point was that Iran no longer feels the deep inequality with the US that it did in the past , and that it may be time to try engagement . 
Over the past three decades , five American presidents have struggled to figure out what to do about Iran . 
All five failed . 
As US President-elect Barack Obama and his advisers assess their foreign-policy priorities , they will encounter the immediate challenge of addressing Iran &apos;s nuclear program and the country &apos;s growing strategic importance in the Middle East and South Asia . 
They will need quickly to face up to the reality that in order to pursue US interests in the region , including stabilizing Iraq and Afghanistan , the current standoff with Iran cannot continue , and that a greater degree of cooperation is unavoidable . 
If they do not want to repeat the failures of past administrations , they will be well advised to do what none of Obama &apos;s predecessors have tried . 
They should make a strategic decision to engage Iran - without any pre-conditions - in discussions on a broad range of issues of significance to both sides . During his candidacy , Obama said of Iran that , &quot; For us not to be in a conversation with them doesn &apos;t make sense . &quot; 
Now , he has the opportunity to follow through . 
Such an approach does not mean having Obama sit down with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei or President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad anytime soon . 
A great deal of preparatory work will be required first . 
This can be carried out by a small team , which would hammer out the details of a mutually acceptable framework for a wide-ranging and unconditional dialogue that enables both governments to produce some modest initial successes , and gradually build the confidence and trust required to imagine solutions to larger problems . 
The process could include appointing a US envoy to Iran . 
Ultimately , direct dialogue at the highest levels should be a key objective . 
This will not be easy . 
At the heart of the American-Iranian conflict is a deep mistrust about each nation &apos;s readiness to tolerate the presence of the other on the world stage . 
Each nation feels that it has been humiliated and demonized by the other . 
What is needed is a process that rebuilds trust and communication so that the give-and-take of negotiation is perceived as serving mutual interests rather than serving up insults to national dignity or identity . 
Although it is far from an exact precedent , the historic 1972 Shanghai Communiqu√© signed by China and the US , which allowed both governments to &quot; agree to disagree &quot; on many issues while committing themselves to dialogue at the highest levels , offers a promising model . This far-sighted framework &apos;s effectiveness has been well proven over time . 
Dialogue with Iran will inevitably be frustrating and difficult , but it offers the only way to lay out possible grounds for constructive engagement and to devise a strategy for heading off a potentially disastrous confrontation . 
Dialogue focused on Iran &apos;s nuclear program or on Iraq alone will not work . 
Instead , the full range of issues that are significant to US-Iran relationship must be on the table . 
Such an approach will require that each side exercise broad restraint and live with the ambiguity of working with a strong adversary to manage profound differences . 
Distrust will continue , signals will be confused , setbacks will be frequent , but the results could well lead over time to greater mutual understanding and a learned capacity to work on some of the most pressing problems , just as the US learned to do with the Soviet Union and China . 
Direct diplomatic and strategic engagement between the US and Iran at the highest levels is a proposition yet to be tested . 
By pursuing this route after he takes office , Obama will force Iran to make a choice : does it want to be a state that is fully integrated into the global economy , or does it want to be an &quot; ideology &quot; with rogue status ? 
It is time that the world found out .
