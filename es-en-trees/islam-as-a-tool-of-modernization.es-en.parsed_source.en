Islam as a Tool of Modernization 
A big worry in Iraq and the wider Middle East is that Islam and modernization are enemies . 
But Malaysian history over the past three decades shows that this belief is mistaken . 
In fact , Islamization has proved to be an effective political means of reconciling the majority of Malays to the country &apos;s rapid economic development . 
In the early 1970 &quot; s , when it was still an overwhelmingly agrarian country and Islamization was just gaining momentum , Malaysia embarked on its so-called &quot; New Economic Policy &quot; ( NEP ) , designed to help the majority Malays gain a bigger share of the country &apos;s wealth . 
After three decades of spectacular economic growth , many Malays have become prosperous and content not only through secular capitalism , but through the country &apos;s renewed sense of Islamic identity , one which - for the most part - embraced modernization . 
( Of course , paradoxes appear every now and then , such as when globalization is advocated alongside demands for stronger censorship . ) 
Islamic-minded politicians such as Anwar Ibrahim gained prominence when Islamization took off in the 1970 &quot; s . 
But the Islam they promoted was not backward looking ; instead , it sought to shape a modernizing economic policy that took note of Muslim sensibilities . 
Faced with the grassroots popularity of this movement , by 1982 the government of then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed decided to co-opt Anwar Ibrahim into his United Malays National Organisation ( UMNO ) , the dominant party within the country &apos;s ruling coalition . 
The strategy worked well , and helped defuse Islamic opposition to the wrenching changes that accompanied the country &apos;s rapid economic modernization . 
During the 1990 &quot; s , however , Anwar increased his influence within the party , unsettling many of the old guard . 
Matters came to a head after the 1997 financial crisis , when Anwar , the deputy prime minister , adopted an even more economically liberal approach than Mahathir . 
Partly in response to this challenge , Anwar was sacked . 
Anwar &apos;s bizarre trial and sentencing on charges of sodomy and abuse of power invigorated the reformasi movement , as growing anti-UMNO and anti-Mahathir sentiments took hold among Islamic-minded Malays . 
This culminated in poor electoral results for the ruling coalition in November 1999 . 
The Islamist party , Parti Islam SeMalaysia ( PAS ) , took power in the states of Kelantan and Trengganu and strongly threatened UMNO in other northern states . 
The personal conflict between Mahathir and Anwar thus led to an apparent rupture between Malaysia &apos;s Islamist political forces and the modernizers of UMNO . 
So , once again , Mahathir felt pressure to adopt a strategy aimed at preventing Islam from becoming a tool of opposition . 
This impulse strongly affected his choice of a successor when he decided to step down as prime minister . 
His choice of Abdullah Badawi , the current prime minister , helped UMNO regain the Islamist moral high ground that the PAS had been claiming . 
It was the beginning of America &apos;s global &quot; war on terror &quot; in 2001 , however , that brought the political march of the Islamist parties to a screeching halt , as it provided an excuse for the government to crack down on the Malay right and the PAS . 
But this only renewed UMNO &apos;s desire to portray itself as sufficiently Islamist . 
So , before stepping down , Mahathir went so far as to declare Malaysia a de facto Muslim state . 
This trend continues . 
One of Badawi &apos;s first acts after taking over as prime minister in October 2003 was to introduce the concept of Islam Hadhari . 
This vague term was finally fleshed out with a list of ten principles in September 2004 , all but one of which , however , was without religious connotations . 
Nevertheless , this move appeared to be all that was needed for Islam-minded voters to return to the fold of the ruling front . 
In the general election in March 2004 - the first since Mahathir stepped down after 22 years in power - moderate Muslims helped Abdullah Badawi to a landslide victory . 
The release of Anwar Ibrahim soon afterwards raised the new premier &apos;s prestige further as a leader who could heal intra-Malay , and intra-Muslim , conflicts . 
Since then , Abdullah Badawi has been popularizing the concept of &quot; Hadhari , &quot; shaping it as a means to shift Islam &apos;s focus from its sanctioning function to its civilizing potential and rendering it less ideological . 
In Malaysia today , Islam is being presented as a generator of civilization and culture , and not merely as a source of religious inspiration . 
This has helped to counter extremist tendencies domestically and provides a conceptual platform for moderate Islam . 
Islam Hadhari tries to project the idea that UMNO &apos;s materialism and nationalism do not contradict Islam . 
With various feints and strategies , Malaysia has effectively managed the tensions between a secular , modernizing agenda and the Islamic faith that the Malays profess . 
By making Islamists and Islamist sentiments a part of the process of modernization , Malaysia demonstrates that Islamic faith and economic growth can be reconciled if politicians are clever enough not to treat them as contradictions .
