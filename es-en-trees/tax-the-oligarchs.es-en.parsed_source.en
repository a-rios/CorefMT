Tax the Oligarchs 
Around the world , there is concern about the arrest of Russian oil billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky . 
The worry is that Russia may be backtracking from democracy and the rule of law . 
Russia faces numerous problems posed by the legacy of Communism and the way the transition from Communism to a market economy was handled . 
One set of problems concerns politics and the difficulties of creating democracy and the rule of law after decades of totalitarianism . 
Another relates to economics . 
Two grievous economic policy errors were committed during Yeltsin &apos;s presidency . 
The first , as I argue in my book Globalization and its Discontents , was to create incentives that led to asset stripping rather than wealth creation . 
The other was to squander the few positive legacies left from the Communist era . 
One such legacy was a high level of human capital , especially in technical and scientific areas , much of which was lost , as many of the country &apos;s most talented people emigrated . 
Another squandered legacy  -  with serious political consequences  -  was the relative equality bequeathed by Communism . 
Politics and economics are in fact inextricably linked here : the erosion of the middle classes , which accompanied the rise of a few enormously wealthy oligarchs , and the descent of millions into poverty , made creation of a democratic society and the rule of law much more difficult . 
The reason is simple . 
It is not the Rockefellers and the Gateses of this world that are the strongest advocates of a &quot; level playing field &quot; and respect for law ( including the law of competition ) . 
Historically , it is the middle classes that have an inherent stake in fairness and equality , thus playing an instrumental role in instituting the rule of law . 
For this reason , coming to terms with the illegitimate privatizations of the 1990 &apos;s , which are at the root of wealth inequality in Russia , is something that still needs to be done  -  and not only as a matter of justice ; it is important for the long-term performance of Russia &apos;s economy . 
Ultimately , security of property rights  -  and the growth it enables  -  depends primarily on the legitimacy with which those rights are viewed by society . 
If those who hold wealth are seen as having obtained it in ways that lack legitimacy , no legal system can make property secure . 
If property is not secure  -  or even is not perceived as secure  -  incentives are distorted . 
Those in control of Russian businesses will thus continue to strip assets and convert them into forms of wealth that can be easily taken out of the country . 
Worse , if the legacy of illegitimate privatizations is not addressed , the economic oligarchy will likely be transformed into a political one as well . 
It is in light of this that Putin &apos;s moves against Khodorkovsky should be seen . 
For if the oligarchs succeed in keeping their ill-gotten gains , it is not hard to imagine someone like Khodorkovsky  -  who was already starting to build a political machine alongside his business empire  -  cashing in his Yukos shares , parking his wealth in a safe haven offshore , and using it to manipulate Russian politics . 
What is to be done , then , with the tainted property gained during the wild privatizations of the 1990 &apos;s ? 
It probably would have been easier for Russia &apos;s government to recapture some of the oligarchs &apos; ill-gotten gains earlier , say , after the ruble crisis of 1998 , when many of them fell into arrears on their loans . 
Although that opportunity has passed , I still think that it will be far easier to address this problem now than , say , in another decade . 
Once Khodorkovsky and his ilk sell their stakes to foreign interests and take their money out of Russia , there will be little that can be done . 
But wouldn &apos;t a reversal of the illegitimate privatizations of the 1990 &apos;s create new problems and undermine Russia &apos;s attempt to establish secure property rights ? 
I believe some of the inequities of the past can be addressed without any direct attack on &quot; property rights , &quot; no matter how dubiously acquired . 
Russia could impose an &quot; excess capital gains tax , &quot; analogous in spirit to the tax imposed on US oil companies when their profits soared , through no effort of their own , from high oil prices in the 1970 &apos;s . 
A tax could be imposed , say , at the rate of 90 % , on the &quot; excess &quot; gains from the acquisition of state assets - e.g. , on gains in excess of 10 % cumulative returns on original equity investments . 
The tax would be payable either when the company is listed on a stock market or when the assets are sold . 
Such a tax would leave the oligarchs with plenty , and could even compensate them for their efforts at restructuring enterprises . 
To encourage domestic investment , and recognizing that it is difficult to tax assets held abroad , an &quot; exit &quot; tax could also be imposed on capital taken out of the country . 
It would be a move somewhat similar to that contemplated in the US by the Clinton administration , which proposed a tax on billionaires who surrendered their citizenship in order to avoid taxation . 
The money raised by the new tax could help restore , for instance , Russia &apos;s ailing health and educational systems . 
To be sure , the tax would not solve all of Russia &apos;s problems . 
It would not eliminate huge inequalities . 
It would , however , go some way towards rectifying the consequences of the &quot; wealth grabs &quot; of the Yeltsin era . 
Most importantly , while it would not ensure the creation of a viable democracy , it would at least reduce the threat to democracy posed by the increasingly poisonous role played by money in Russian politics .
