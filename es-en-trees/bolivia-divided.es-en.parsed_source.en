Bolivia Divided 
Bolivia seems to be in danger of falling apart . 
Support for President Evo Morales , who won 53 % of the vote in December 2005 , represented a demand for democratic coexistence , social change , and national unity . 
Two years later , the country is marked by regional , social , ethnic , and ideological divisions , and its government is confused and disoriented . 
Morales passed a constitutional reform that included changes in the conception and role of the state , private property , and management of natural resources and taxes . 
His opponents have responded by proclaiming their right to self-determination and threatening to boycott the referendum with which he hopes to legalize the reform . 
Morales &quot; sympathizers threaten to erect roadblocks . 
Only three of Bolivia &apos;s nine departments support the government , while 60 % of the population is concentrated in the six other departments , which account for 70 % of the country &apos;s territory and two-thirds of its GDP . 
The government &apos;s desire to impose its will on the majority of the country is therefore potentially dangerous . 
Indeed , Bolivia , one of Latin America &apos;s poorest countries , has become increasingly polarized . 
The conflict is not , as the government claims , between the people and a few oligarchs . 
The urban population , already 70 % and growing rapidly , has begun withdrawing their support from Morales , except in La Paz , El Alto , and Oruro , and in the most unionized sectors . 
Rural peasants and Indians still support him , as do senior military officials . 
The erosion of support for the government is due to its inefficiency : inflation is triple official forecasts , and basic foodstuffs and fuel are scarce and their supply irregular . 
Investment has been discouraged by the rejection of corporate culture , social and political tension , and uncertainty about the reforms . 
Today , Bolivia is being led by its government toward antagonism between Indians and non-Indians , the eastern and western regions , and city and country , exacerbated by insults and actions that are acquiring an increasingly racist and ethnocentric edge . 
The identity of Bolivia &apos;s indigenous people , who were historically excluded from political , social , and economic life , is beginning to be seen as a synonym for confrontation , violence , and ethnic aggressiveness . 
The government is rapidly isolating itself from the regional , civic , and political opposition that , little by little , has been rising to causes such as autonomy , pluralism , the need for consensus , and freedom of expression . 
The official discourse is entrenched in statism and centralism , with growing disregard for democratic principles and procedures . 
The government accuses the opposition of advocating the secession of hydrocarbon-rich territories , threatening them with repression . 
In turn , the most radical regional opposition groups threaten secession if the central government blocks their demands for greater self-government . 
The first consequence of this process has been a transition from legality to arbitrary power . 
Key institutions , including the Constitutional Court , the Supreme Court , and the Senate of the Republic , are being eroded . 
The Constituent Assembly , which should build national unity and democratic legitimacy , has been turned into a mechanism for division and absolute power . 
The government has had the National Congress surrounded by unionists so that only its ardent supporters can enter for the Senate &apos;s sessions . 
Similarly , the government cut the department governors &quot; revenue in order to finance an expanded pension plan and weaken them politically and economically . 
The government &apos;s closing of democratic and institutional spaces produces responses of a proportional and equivalent force , which in turn tends to expand the political conflict toward areas where force and violence prevail . 
A presidential order recalling the unionist , police , and army troops is urgently needed to avoid greater tragedy ( there have already been 30 deaths in the last two years ) and create conditions for dialogue and a democratic covenant with regional , civic , and political opposition forces . 
Otherwise , the referendum to ratify the government &apos;s proposed &quot; MAS ( Movement for Socialism ) constitution &quot; will only fuel more strife . 
Two-thirds of Bolivians are dissatisfied with the way the Constituent Assembly has carried out its work , and a majority believes that the constitutional text is illegal . 
In this conflict , both sides have raised their bets , and their threats could become a reality . 
But this is not inevitable , above all because Aymaras and non-Aymaras , Indians and non-Indians , will continue to work to preserve unity in democracy as the basis for a more just future .
