Broadband Liberation 
NEW DELHI - In July , I was among 30 men and women from around the world - government ministers , bureaucrats , technologists , and strategic thinkers - who gathered at the International Telecommunications Union ( ITU ) in Geneva to discuss how broadband can transform the world for the better . 
This &quot; Broadband Commission &quot; met under the Chairmanship of Rwanda &apos;s President Paul Kagame and the Mexican communications mogul Carlos Slim . 
The ITU , a United Nations body , established the Commission in partnership with UNESCO , and the joint chairmanship was no accident . 
The UN recognizes that if the information revolution is to advance further , it will take a public-private effort . 
As ITU Secretary-General Hamadoun Tour√© has put it , &quot; In the twenty-first century , affordable , ubiquitous broadband networks will be as critical to social and economic prosperity as networks like transport , water , and power . &quot; 
The Swiss writer and playwright Max Frisch once dismissed technology as &quot; the art of arranging the world so that we need not experience it . &quot; 
Today , however , technology is essential to effective participation in our world . 
And , although mankind cannot live by technology alone , the information revolution has liberated millions of people . 
Information is liberating in the traditional political sense of the term : the spread of information has had a direct impact on the degree of accountability and transparency that governments must deliver if they are to survive . 
It is also liberating economically . 
Information technologies are a cost-effective form of capital . 
Estonia and Costa Rica are well-known examples of how information-access strategies can help accelerate output growth and raise income levels . 
Some of the least developed countries , such as Mali and Bangladesh , have shown how determined leadership and innovative approaches can , with international support , connect remote and rural areas to the Internet and mobile telephony , thereby helping to liberate subsistence farmers who were previously tied to local knowledge and local markets . 
Likewise , mobile networks are delivering health services to the most remote areas of India . 
One successful UNESCO initiative is the creation of multipurpose community telecenters throughout the developing world , providing communication and information facilities - phone , fax , Internet , computers , audio-visual equipment - for a wide range of community uses . 
India &apos;s Unique Identification Number project , under the capable stewardship of information-technology pioneer Nandan Nilekani , will enable access to government , banking , and insurance services at the grass-roots level . 
There is no doubt that the Internet can be a democratizing tool . 
In some parts of the world - and certainly in most of the West - it already is , since large amounts of information are now accessible to almost anyone . 
But the stark reality of today &apos;s world is that you can tell the rich from the poor by their Internet connections . 
Indeed , economic development nowadays requires more than thinking only of the poverty line ; one must also think of the high-speed digital line , the fiber-optic line - indeed , all the lines that exclude those who are not plugged into the possibilities of our world . 
But the digital divide is no immutable gap . 
On the contrary , the technology gap between developed and developing countries , measured by levels of penetration by personal computers and information-technology and communications services , has narrowed markedly over the course of the past decade , with rapid growth in mobile phone and Internet use . 
The average level of Internet and mobile-phone penetration in the rich world in 1997 - 4.1 Internet users and 10.7 mobile phones per 100 inhabitants - was reached in developing countries only five years later . 
By contrast , the average level of fixed-line telecommunication penetration in developing countries is nearly 50 years behind the levels of the West . 
Not surprisingly , it was in Africa - not Europe or America - where the cell phone first overtook the housebound handset . 
More Africans have become telecommunications users in the last four years than in the entire twentieth century . 
The Indian story is even more remarkable . 
When I left India in 1975 for graduate studies in the United States , the country had roughly 600 million residents and just two million land-line telephones . 
Today , India holds the world record for the number of cell phones sold in a month -20 million - and for the most telephone connections made in a single month in any country in the history of telecommunications . 
The growth in mobile-telephone technology demonstrates that the digital divide is shifting , and the focus of development efforts must change with it . 
India , for example , has 525 million mobile phone users and fewer than 150 million people with Internet access , so using mobile-phone technology as a tool of e-governance has become vital . 
This calls for creative means of effecting information transfer and making and receiving official payments by telephone . 
Security is a key area of concern today in e-governance - both physical security , in an age of terrorism , and cyber security . 
Using technology to deliver security will become even more important in areas such as information sharing , disaster management , and data-privacy standards . 
Information and communications technology is a powerful tool to address underdevelopment , isolation , poverty , and the lack of political accountability and political freedom . 
But people need access first and foremost . 
Delivering these benefits to ever more people will require resources , international cooperation , and political will .
