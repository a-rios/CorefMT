The Road to Food Security 
ROME - Recently , I was on a road in the Southern Choma District of Zambia to meet with Rosemary Pisani , a smallholder farmer and mother of eight who struggled to feed her children prior to joining a farmer &apos;s cooperative to raise goats . 
Thanks to the cooperative and support from other farmers , she now has a thriving business and all of her children are in school . 
On the way to meet her , I passed women walking through mud to the market with large loads of fruit and vegetables stacked on their heads . 
I imagined how I might be on my way to a very different rural community if the road we were on was paved and well maintained . 
Often in Africa , the few paved roads that do exist are littered with potholes and lead to unpaved ones that are nearly impossible to navigate without a proper vehicle . 
Closer to farming communities , roads disappear entirely . 
In sub-Saharan Africa , almost 70 % of all people living in rural areas live more than a 30-minute walk from the nearest maintained road . 
Kofi Annan , Chairperson of the Board of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa ( AGRA ) , has acknowledged this isolation : &quot; The average African smallholding farmer swims alone . 
She has no insurance against erratic weather patterns , gets no subsidies , and has no access to credit . 
I say &quot; she &quot; because the majority of small-scale farmers in Africa are women . &quot; 
Indeed , half of the world &apos;s smallholders are women , and we must keep in mind their punishing task of walking long lengths to get their produce to market . 
At the International Fund for Agricultural Development ( IFAD ) , we believe that farming , regardless of size or scale , must be seen as a business , and smallholder farmers as small-scale business owners rather than poor people who need handouts . 
There is growing recognition that these smallholder farmers and their rural communities are a major part of the solution to food insecurity and poverty - but only if they have what they need to do their jobs . 
The Green Revolution of the last century had a tremendous impact on agricultural yields and food production , transforming the lives of millions of people . 
Much of this success stemmed from infrastructure that was already in place . 
India &apos;s road density at the start of its Green Revolution in the 1970 &quot; s was 388 kilometers per 1,000 square kilometres . 
New roads bring other essential services to rural communities . 
In Ethiopia , only 2 % of rural people have access to electricity , and telephone communication is more or less absent . 
Researchers believe that this is because only 17 % of rural communities in the country live within one mile of a paved road . 
Together with poor infrastructure , many small farmers in Africa have insufficient access to productive assets , such as land , water , and new technologies . 
As a result , yields are generally too low to allow the millions of rural households to generate marketable surpluses . 
Even if smallholders are able to produce a surplus , their lack of access to downstream activities , such as processing and marketing , prevents them from selling it easily . 
The cause of these missing , but vital , resources lies in the shameful neglect of agriculture in the past two decades . 
Both developed and developing countries - caught up in rapid economic expansion and technological development - got distracted . 
They turned off the tap to agriculture , leaving small farmers to rely on basic farming practices and on government and donor handouts . 
That tap must be turned back on . 
In IFAD &apos;s experience , working simply to double the income of a smallholder farmer who scrapes by on less than a dollar a day is poverty management , because at two dollars a day , he or she still remains poor . 
But supporting that smallholder in launching a farming business that could generate a five-fold increase in income amounts to poverty eradication . 
If smallholder farmers are to be given the opportunity to become viable businesses , it is essential that they be connected to markets . 
Each link in the value chain , from the smallholder to the local trade agents and agro-processors to regional and national markets , needs to be strengthened . 
In addition , we need to provide them with research and technology to ensure that they can grow the best-quality produce , and storage capabilities so that they can sell at peak prices . 
If smallholder farmers have the basic infrastructure they need to get their goods to market , they will not only be able to feed themselves and their communities , but will contribute to wider food security . 
We just need to put the pavement down so that farmers like those I saw in Zambia can more easily make their way on the road to food security .
