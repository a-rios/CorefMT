Denying Democracy in Hong Kong 
This week marks the 15th Anniversary of the promulgation of Hong Kong &apos;s constitution , the Basic Law , by China &apos;s National People &apos;s Congress . 
The Basic Law supposedly established a political framework to accord with the late Deng Xiaoping &apos;s policy of &quot; one country , two systems , &quot; with Hong Kong &apos;s people ruling Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy . 
Under this policy , Hong Kong &apos;s capitalist system , the rule of law , and its people &apos;s freedoms and way of life were to be preserved . 
It provided for a popularly elected Chief Executive and Legislative Council . 
Indeed , apart from defense and foreign affairs , Hong Kong was to be master of its own house . 
But , despite its promise of universal suffrage , the Basic Law restricts democratic development during the first ten years after the handover of Hong Kong to China . 
As a result , full democracy is to be permitted only in 2007 . 
I said in my maiden speech in the Legislative Council in 1985 that the policy of &quot; one country , two systems &quot; cannot work without democracy . 
As Deng once said of China : &quot; With a good system , even evil men cannot do evil . 
For Hong Kong , the only good system is democracy . 
For under a democratic system , those in power realize that it is the people who put them in office , and they will be voted out if they are perceived to be serving Beijing &apos;s interests rather than Hong Kong &apos;s . 
Of course , Deng &apos;s policy can work only if Beijing wants it to work . 
Indeed , not only must China refrain from interfering in Hong Kong &apos;s internal affairs , but it must encourage the people of Hong Kong to defend their much smaller system . 
Unfortunately , Beijing has other ideas . 
On July 1 , 2003 , the sixth anniversary of the handover , nearly a million people took to Hong Kong &apos;s streets in a peaceful protest against an anti-subversion bill that would have eroded freedom of the press , of religion , and of association . 
The demonstration led to a postponement of the bill , and ultimately to its withdrawal , as well as to the resignation of the Secretary for Security , who was responsible for it . 
But that demonstration also spurred a major change in China &apos;s policy towards Hong Kong . 
Until then , interference from China was covert and subtle , so that the public perception was that Hong Kong &apos;s Chief Executive , Tung Chee-hwa , was in charge . 
After the demonstration , China &apos;s government adopted a hands-on approach , letting the people of Hong Kong know who the boss really is . 
Thus , on April 26 , 2004 , China announced its unilateral decision that Hong Kong is not to have democracy in 2007 without saying when Hong Kong will have it . 
Then came Tung &apos;s resignation as Chief Executive in March . 
The popular belief is that Tung was sacked or pressured to step down . 
Tung was handpicked by former Chinese President Jiang Zemin in 1996 and was openly endorsed by Jiang for a second term in 2002 . 
But he was not popular because the public viewed him as a puppet of China and a crony of big developers , particularly Li Ka-shing , Hong Kong &apos;s richest person . 
Although the election of the next Chief Executive will not take place until July , China has let it be known that our present Chief Secretary , Donald Tsang , is the chosen one . 
Moreover , although the Basic Law prescribes a five-year term for the Chief Executive , China is insisting that the winner will only serve for the remainder of Tung &apos;s term , until June 30 , 2007 . 
The clear message is that after almost eight years of Chinese rule , China &apos;s leaders do not trust anyone in Hong Kong to govern for five years . 
This , surely , is the greatest indictment of China &apos;s Hong Kong policy since 1997 . 
But the solution lies in changing the system , not just the leader . 
The way forward is not more control or suppression , but more trust and democracy . 
The latter leads to the full implementation of Deng &apos;s policy , enshrined in the Basic Law , of &quot; one country , two systems , &quot; while the former turns the Basic Law into a worthless piece of paper . 
In 1984 , British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , said of the impending handover of Hong Kong , &quot; The eyes of the world are on us . &quot; 
That may or may not be true today , but at least the people of Taiwan are watching .
