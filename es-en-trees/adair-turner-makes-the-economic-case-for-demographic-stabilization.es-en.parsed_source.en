When Fewer Is Better 
LONDON - Is a shrinking population always a bad thing ? 
Judging by the lamentations of some economists and policymakers in the advanced economies , where people are living longer and birth rates have fallen below replacement levels , one certainly might think so . 
In fact , the benefits of demographic stability - or even slight decline - outweigh any adverse effects . 
To be sure , an aging population poses obvious challenges for pension systems . 
And , as economists like Paul Krugman have suggested , it could also mean that advanced economies face not only a slow recovery , but also the danger of &quot; secular stagnation . &quot; 
With slower population growth , the need to invest in capital stock diminishes . 
Meanwhile , people planning for longer retirements may save more to ensure adequate pensions . 
If these savings exceed investment needs , they could lead to inadequate aggregate demand , depressing economic growth . 
But the policy challenges associated with these demographic shifts are manageable . 
And , perhaps more important , the benefits of increased longevity and reduced fertility are considerable . 
Rising life expectancy is the welcome product of medical and economic progress , and additional increases are almost certain . 
Indeed , the average life expectancy for children born in prosperous countries could soon exceed 100 . 
That implies an ever-rising ratio of those over 65 to younger cohorts . 
But as long as average retirement ages rise to keep stable the proportions of life spent in work and in retirement , the fact that working and retirement years are growing at equal rates has no adverse economic effect . 
There is , moreover , strong evidence that rising longevity can mean more years of healthy active life , not unhealthy dependency . 
Only bad policies , such as the recent German commitment to reduce retirement ages , can turn longer lives into an economic problem . 
Declining fertility , including in some lower- and middle-income countries , such as Iran and Brazil , also reflects hugely positive social developments - particularly the empowerment of women . 
Wherever women have the right to an education and to choose how many children to have , fertility rates fall to or slightly below replacement levels . 
Falling birth rates challenge pension systems more than rising longevity , because they imply a rising old-age dependency ratio even if retirement ages increase in line with life expectancy . 
But as long as birth rates are only slightly below replacement level , pension systems &quot; sustainability can be ensured by means of affordable increases in contribution rates . 
And lower birth rates deliver the offsetting benefit of lower child dependency ratios , reducing education costs or enabling increased investment in education per child . 
Slower population growth might also reduce the increase in wealth-to-income ratios , and the resulting increase in inequality that Thomas Piketty recently highlighted . 
In many countries , the increase results primarily from the rise in real-estate prices relative to income , as more prosperous people devote a growing share of their income to purchasing property in desirable locations . 
Continued population growth would intensify competition for such &quot; positional goods , &quot; which are not easily supplied in greater volume . 
A stable population , or actual decline , would reduce their importance somewhat . 
It would also make it easier to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions at an acceptable cost , and to preserve and enhance local environmental quality , which people increasingly value as their incomes rise . 
For today &apos;s advanced economies , a stable or slightly declining population would likely be optimal for human welfare . 
For the world as a whole , it is a desirable goal . 
But it is also a distant goal . 
Indeed , population decline in the advanced countries remains far less of a problem than rapid population growth in many developing countries . 
The United Nations &quot; medium fertility scenario projects that the world &apos;s population will rise from seven billion today to ten billion by 2050 . 
Nigeria &apos;s population could rise from 123 million in 2000 to 440 million by 2050 , while Yemen &apos;s could grow from 18 million to 42 million . 
High fertility rates in many countries are partly a consequence of low income . 
But causation also runs the other way . 
High fertility rates stymie prospects for economic growth , because excessively rapid population growth makes it impossible to accumulate per capita stocks of physical and human capital at the pace required to drive rapid income gains . 
That said , efforts to control population growth through measures like China &apos;s compulsory one-child policy are both morally abhorrent and unnecessary . 
As examples like Iran show , even low-income countries can achieve dramatic fertility reductions simply by providing choice and education . 
But that does not change the fact that China &apos;s rapid fertility decline played a major role in its extraordinary economic breakthrough . 
Facile commentary often suggests the opposite : countries with high fertility rates supposedly enjoy the demographic dividend of a rapidly rising and youthful population . 
But , beyond some rate of population growth , jobs cannot be created fast enough to absorb the growing workforce . 
Almost all countries with fertility rates well above replacement levels face economically and socially harmful youth-unemployment rates . 
Political instability in the Middle East has many causes , but among them is the lack of jobs for young people , especially young men . 
Yes , demographic slowdown may , as Krugman and others have argued , increase the risk of deficient demand and below-potential growth . 
But if the problem is inadequate demand , the danger can be averted . 
Governments and central banks can always create additional nominal demand if they are willing to use all of the policy tools available to them , such as debt- or money-financed public investment . 
And if there are underused resources , additional real growth will result . 
If aging populations lead to secular stagnation , the cause will be deficient policies . 
By contrast , the problems created by excessively rapid population growth are rooted in real and unavoidable constraints . 
The manageable challenges created by rising life expectancy and lower birth rates should not be allowed to obscure the huge benefits of greater longevity and population stabilization . 
And it certainly should not blind us to the adverse economic and social consequences of rapid population growth .
