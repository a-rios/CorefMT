Talking Sense About Global Warming 
LONDON - In February , 14 distinguished climate scientists , economists , and policy experts came together to discuss how to tackle global warming . 
This week , the London School of Economics and Oxford University are publishing their conclusions . 
They are worth considering . 
The group was brought together by Gwyn Prins , a well-regarded expert in security policy and international relations who heads LSE &apos;s Mackinder Programme for the Study of Long Wave Events . 
Participants included climate scientist Mike Hulme of the University of East Anglia , climate policy expert Roger Pielke Jr. of the University of Colorado , and climate economist Christopher Green of McGill University . 
The group &apos;s report , &quot; The Hartwell Paper , &quot; outlines a new direction for climate policy after the collapse of last year &apos;s attempts to negotiate a global climate deal . 
The authors note that 18 years of the &quot; Kyoto Protocol approach &quot; to international climate policy have failed to produce any discernable real-world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases . 
What defines the Kyoto approach , of course , is a single-minded focus on cutting carbon-dioxide emissions . 
&quot; The Hartwell Paper &quot; argues that the Kyoto approach , based as it is on past experience with relatively simple environmental problems like acid rain , was always doomed to failure . 
The group points out that it makes no sense to compare climate change to other environmental challenges that we have faced and solved . 
Climate change is much more complicated , involving open , complex , and imperfectly understood systems . 
Unlike , say , acid rain or smog , it is not &quot; a conventional environmental &quot; problem . &quot; &quot; 
It is as much &quot; an energy problem , an economic development problem , or a land-use problem . &quot; 
Climate economists widely acknowledge that there are only four policy levers that can be used in an attempt to lower carbon emissions and rein in climate change : reducing the world &apos;s population , shrinking the global economy , increasing the efficiency of energy consumption , and decreasing carbon intensity ( meaning that we create less carbon for each unit of energy that we produce ) . 
Reducing global population is implausible , and deliberately reducing the size of the global economy would result in increased hardship for billions . 
&quot; The Hartwell Paper , &quot; then , sets out to develop a strategy that identifies a number of ways of pulling the levers of energy efficiency and carbon intensity . 
The Hartwell group proposes that we adopt three basic climate-related goals : ensuring secure , affordable energy supplies for everyone ( which means developing alternatives to fossil fuels ) ; ensuring that economic development doesn &apos;t wreak environmental havoc ( which means not just reducing CO2 emissions , but also cutting indoor pollution from burning biomass , reducing ozone , and protecting tropical forests ) ; and making sure that we are prepared to cope with whatever climate changes may occur , man-made or natural ( which means recognizing , at last , the importance of adapting to climate change ) . 
Achieving these goals will obviously require heavy lifting . 
The Hartwell group correctly notes that in order to be successful , our approach to climate policy should offer obvious advantages ( &quot; rapid and demonstrable pay-back &quot; ) , appeal to a wide variety of people , and produce measurable results . 
The Kyoto approach , of course , does none of these things . 
Instead of single-mindedly trying to force people to do without carbon-emitting fuels , the Hartwell group suggests that we pursue a number of other worthy goals - for example , adaptation , reforestation , encouraging biodiversity , and improving air quality - each of which is important , and all of which may also reduce carbon emissions . 
As the report notes , &quot; the all-inclusive &quot; Kyoto &quot; type of climate policy ... needs to be broken up into separate issues again , each addressed on its merits and each in its own ways . &quot; 
At the same time , the group adds , we must recognize that we won &apos;t make any real progress in cutting CO2 emissions until we can provide developing economies with affordable alternatives to the fossil fuels on which they currently depend . 
&quot; In short , &quot; the report notes , &quot; we need to ignite ... an energy technology revolution . &quot; 
The Hartwell group argues that mass improvements are needed across many technologies , requiring the determined participation of governments . 
They suggest partially funding the required research and development with a &quot; slowly rising but initially low carbon tax &quot; that would avoid undermining economic growth . 
If any - or all - of this sounds familiar , it may be because I have been arguing much the same points for some time . 
If my experience is any guide , the members of the Hartwell group should expect to be attacked as heretics for questioning the Kyoto orthodoxy . 
As the saying goes , &quot; insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result . &quot; 
With respect to global warming , it &apos;s time we came to our senses .
