America &apos;s Political Class Struggle 
NEW YORK - America is on a collision course with itself . 
This month &apos;s deal between President Barack Obama and the Republicans in Congress to extend the tax cuts initiated a decade ago by President George W. Bush is being hailed as the start of a new bipartisan consensus . 
I believe , instead , that it is a false truce in what will become a pitched battle for the soul of American politics . 
As in many countries , conflicts over public morality and national strategy come down to questions of money . 
In the United States , this is truer than ever . 
The US is running an annual budget deficit of around $ 1 trillion , which may widen further as a result of the new tax agreement . 
This level of annual borrowing is far too high for comfort . 
It must be cut , but how ? 
The problem is America &apos;s corrupted politics and loss of civic morality . 
One political party , the Republicans , stands for little except tax cuts , which they place above any other goal . 
The Democrats have a bit wider set of interests , including support for health care , education , training , and infrastructure . 
But , like the Republicans , the Democrats , too , are keen to shower tax cuts on their major campaign contributors , predominantly rich Americans . 
The result is a dangerous paradox . 
The US budget deficit is enormous and unsustainable . 
The poor are squeezed by cuts in social programs and a weak job market . 
One in eight Americans depends on Food Stamps to eat . 
Yet , despite these circumstances , one political party wants to gut tax revenues altogether , and the other is easily dragged along , against its better instincts , out of concern for keeping its rich contributors happy . 
This tax-cutting frenzy comes , incredibly , after three decades of elite fiscal rule in the US that has favored the rich and powerful . 
Since Ronald Reagan became President in 1981 , America &apos;s budget system has been geared to supporting the accumulation of vast wealth at the top of the income distribution . 
Amazingly , the richest 1 % of American households now has a higher net worth than the bottom 90 % . 
The annual income of the richest 12,000 households is greater than that of the poorest 24 million households . 
The Republican Party &apos;s real game is to try to lock that income and wealth advantage into place . 
They fear , rightly , that sooner or later everyone else will begin demanding that the budget deficit be closed in part by raising taxes on the rich . 
After all , the rich are living better than ever , while the rest of American society is suffering . 
It makes sense to tax them more . 
The Republicans are out to prevent that by any means . 
This month , they succeeded , at least for now . 
But they want to follow up their tactical victory - which postpones the restoration of pre-Bush tax rates for a couple of years - with a longer-term victory next spring . 
Their leaders in Congress are already declaring that they will slash public spending in order to begin reducing the deficit . 
Ironically , there is one area in which large budget cuts are certainly warranted : the military . 
But that is the one item most Republicans won &apos;t touch . 
They want to slash the budget not by ending the useless war in Afghanistan , and by eliminating unnecessary weapons systems , but by cutting education , health , and other benefits for the poor and working class . 
In the end , I don &apos;t think they will succeed . 
For the moment , most Americans seem to be going along with Republican arguments that it is better to close the budget deficit through spending cuts rather than tax increases . 
Yet when the actual budget proposals are made , there will be a growing backlash . 
With their backs against the wall , I predict , poor and working-class Americans will begin to agitate for social justice . 
This may take time . 
The level of political corruption in America is staggering . 
Everything now is about money to run electoral campaigns , which have become incredibly expensive . 
The mid-term elections cost an estimated $ 4.5 billion , with most of the contributions coming from big corporations and rich contributors . 
These powerful forces , many of which operate anonymously under US law , are working relentlessly to defend those at the top of the income distribution . 
But make no mistake : both parties are implicated . 
There is already talk that Obama will raise $ 1 billion or more for his re-election campaign . 
That sum will not come from the poor . 
The problem for the rich is that , other than military spending , there is no place to cut the budget other than in areas of core support for the poor and working class . 
Is America really going to cut health benefits and retirement income ? Will it really balance the budget by slashing education spending at a time when US students already are being out-performed by their Asian counterparts ? 
Will America really let its public infrastructure continue to deteriorate ? 
The rich will try to push such an agenda , but ultimately they will fail . 
Obama swept to power on the promise of change . 
So far there has been none . 
His administration is filled with Wall Street bankers . 
His top officials leave to join the banks , as his budget director Peter Orszag recently did . 
He is always ready to serve the interests of the rich and powerful , with no line in the sand , no limit to &quot; compromise . &quot; 
If this continues , a third party will emerge , committed to cleaning up American politics and restoring a measure of decency and fairness . 
This , too , will take time . 
The political system is deeply skewed against challenges to the two incumbent parties . 
Yet the time for change will come . 
The Republicans believe that they have the upper hand and can pervert the system further in favor of the rich . 
I believe that they will be proved wrong .
