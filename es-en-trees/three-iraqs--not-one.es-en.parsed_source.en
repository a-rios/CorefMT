Three Iraqs , Not One 
America &apos;s mounting difficulties in setting up a coherent form of government in Iraq , let alone a democratic one , inspire a question that most statesmen consider unthinkable : is it possible that there is no way to re-constitute Iraq as one state , and that alternative options must be considered , unpalatable as they may appear ? 
Like so many problems in the re-birth of states wounded by dictatorship - Eastern Europe is a good example - Iraq &apos;s difficulties have deep historical roots . 
To blame everything on the heavy-handedness of the Americans is too simplistic and shallow , even if their mistakes have , indeed , been legion . 
Iraq was established in the 1920 &apos;s by the British , who occupied the region after the Ottoman Empire disintegrated at the end of WWI . 
Their policies were dictated by British imperial interests , and gave no consideration to the wishes , interests , or characteristics of the local population . 
What British imperial planners did was to stitch together three disparate provinces of the old Ottoman Empire and put at their head a prince from Hedjaz ( now a part of Saudi Arabia ) . 
The three provinces - Mosul , Baghdad , and Basra - each had very distinct characters and very different population structures . 
Mosul had a Kurdish majority , with significant Assyrian-Christian and Turkoman minorities ; 
Baghdad was mainly Sunni ; and Basra was predominantly Shi &apos;ite . 
Throwing such disparate groups into one body politic doomed the newly invented country to decades of strife and repression . 
The old Ottoman Empire ruled these three provinces - as it ruled all of its imperial possessions - through its historically autocratic means . 
The challenge facing the new Iraqi state was to try to create a non-despotic , relatively representative form of government in which all sectors of the population would find an expression of their political will . 
This turned out to be an impossible mission . 
For this reason Iraq - even before Saddam Hussein - always suffered the most repressive regime of any Arab state . 
In a country where Shi &apos;ites form the majority , the Sunnis - traditionally the hegemonic group in all Arab countries - were totally unwilling to allow any democratic process to jeopardize their rule . 
A Shi &apos;ite insurrection was brutally put down in the 1920 &apos;s ( with the help of the British Royal Air Force ) . 
Similarly , Kurdish attempts at autonomy before WWII were drowned in bloody massacres of tens of thousands of innocent civilians , and even the Assyrian Christian minority - a relatively small group , with no political ambitions - was exposed to murderous assaults in the 1930 &apos;s . 
Under these conditions , with the Sunni ruling minority constantly feeling threatened , it was no accident that the only attempt in any Arab country to establish something like a pro-Nazi fascist regime occurred in Iraq in the early 1940 &apos;s under Rashid Ali al-Khailani . 
The British suppressed this misadventure , but not before hundreds of Jews in Baghdad were murdered in a wild farhood ( pogrom ) instigated by the short-lived pro-Nazi government . 
Saddam &apos;s regime was merely the most extreme manifestation of the harsh underlying fact that Iraq &apos;s geography and demography condemned it to rule by the iron fist . 
Nor has Saddam &apos;s fall changed this fact : anti-US violence is not only an expression of anger at foreign occupation ; it is also a Sunni attempt to abort the establishment of a democratic order that would put them - the historical masters - in a subordinate position . 
Similarly , one cannot see the Kurds in the north submitting willingly to a Baghdad-dominated Arab regime , let alone a Shi &apos;ite one ( most Kurds are Sunnis ) . 
There is little understanding in the West of how deep the Sunni / Shi &apos;ite divide runs . 
Put yourself in pre-1648 Europe , a time when Protestants and Catholics slaughtered each other with abandon , and you &apos;ll understand the enmity immediately . 
So what can be done ? 
Yugoslavia &apos;s example shows that in multi-ethnic and multi-religious countries deeply riven by conflict , partition and separation may be the only way to ensure stability and democratization . 
There is no doubt today that Croatia and Serbia - despite their difficulties - stand a better chance of becoming more or less stable democracies than if they were still fighting for mastery among themselves within the Procrustean bed of the former Yugoslavia . 
Nor is federation an alternative - as the terms of the federation itself become the bones of contention ( see Bosnia or Cyprus ) . 
Even the pacific Czechs and Slovaks found it easier to develop their respective democratic structures through a velvet divorce rather than be joined in an unworkable marriage . 
The time has come to think the unthinkable , about creating a Kurdish state in the north , an Arab Sunni one in the center around Baghdad , and an Arab Shi &apos;ite state in the south around Basra . 
Repeating mantras about territorial integrity - the conventional wisdom of international relations - is productive only as long as it ensures stability and averts chaos . 
Again , as Yugoslavia - and the Soviet Union - showed , once strife replaces stability , territorial integrity loses its strategic meaning and legitimacy . 
This is not a universal prescription for ethnically homogenous states . 
The point is simply that there are moments in history when democratization and nation building coincide , and that in deeply divided societies the minimum consensus needed for both to succeed simultaneously is difficult to achieve . 
All this may run contrary to conventional wisdom , but who thought that the USSR would disintegrate ? 
Creative and innovative thinking is needed about Iraq ; otherwise today &apos;s mayhem will continue - and worsen .
