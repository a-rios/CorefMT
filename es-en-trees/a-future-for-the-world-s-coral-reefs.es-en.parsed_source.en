A Future for the World \ u0027s Coral Reefs ? 
Coral reefs are the world &apos;s most biologically rich marine ecosystems , harboring some of the world &apos;s most beautiful organisms . 
They provide the principal source of protein for over ten million people worldwide . 
Reef-based activities ( principally fishing and tourism ) form the economic livelihood of millions more . 
Clearly , the human costs of a worldwide breakdown of these ecosystems are enormous . 
Yet global deterioration of coral reefs is severe and ongoing . 
Wholesale disintegration of reef ecosystems has occurred in some places , and collapse on a worldwide scale is a real risk . 
But there is some good news , too : we know what steps the international community can take now to protect and restore reefs &apos; &quot; resilience &quot;  -  their capacity to maintain integrity in the face of the environmental fluctuations that are a natural part of life in any ecosystem . 
We must mediate the severity of global warming , while simultaneously conserving the resilience of coral reefs . 
Historically , the principal agents of reef degradation have been over-fishing and pollution , not global warming . 
In healthy ecosystems , when prey numbers decline , predators become malnourished , and their numbers decline , too , giving their prey a chance to recover . 
But human predators are different . 
When our prey numbers decline , their economic value tends to increase , so fishing intensifies . 
This means that once predator species become depleted , fishing pressure shifts towards plant-eating fish species , leading to precipitous declines in the numbers of herbivores on coral reefs . 
Herbivorous fish are key players on coral reefs . 
When coral populations decline in the aftermath of cyclones , diseases , and other disturbances , it is the herbivores that keep seaweed in check , and allow coral populations to recover . 
Without them , fast-growing seaweed quickly monopolizes space on the reef , preventing restoration of healthy quantities of coral cover . 
Because corals provide the habitat structure on which other reef organisms depend , the decreases in coral cover lead to big decreases in a reef &apos;s biodiversity . 
Pollution by nutrients and toxins from adjacent land areas further vitiate coral populations &apos; ability to recover , giving seaweed an even greater competitive edge . 
Corals are formed by a symbiosis between an animal and a one-celled plant . 
The animal provides shelter and nutrients for the plant ; the plant converts sunlight into energy , which it shares with the animal . 
For reasons that are not yet fully understood , this partnership breaks down when corals experience unusually high temperatures . 
The plant is expelled , and corals turn a brilliant white color . 
If temperatures soon return to normal , the partnership can be restored . 
But if corals remain &quot; bleached &quot; for too long , they die . 
For many species of coral , this bleaching threshold is usually only a couple of degrees centigrade above the typical maximum temperature for a given location . 
Interpreted in light of even the most optimistic global warming scenarios , this is disturbing news . 
If coral bleaching thresholds remain steady , local summer temperatures will exceed those thresholds regularly within a few decades . 
Corals grow slowly , so reefs sustaining severe bleaching will not recover before they bleach again . 
Fortunately , there is evidence that bleaching thresholds evolve . 
Most coral species have broad geographical distributions , and bleach at different temperatures depending on location . 
Many species that bleach at 28 
Two things can be done to protect coral reefs . 
The first is obvious : minimize global warming by , say , honoring the Kyoto Treaty &apos;s emissions targets . 
Second , we must restore coral reefs &apos; capacity to cope with environmental change - their resilience - by protecting the fish stocks that keep seaweed in check , and thereby facilitate the recovery of coral populations from bleaching . 
These recovery phases enable adaptations to higher temperatures to spread . 
Without fish , seaweed dominance will prevent that recovery . 
The catastrophic collapse of fish stocks around the world - on coral reefs and elsewhere - has provided hard lessons about managing fisheries . 
Many intensively regulated fisheries have collapsed along with the unregulated ones . 
So there is a growing consensus that standard techniques for managing fisheries must be complemented with a system of &quot; no-take zones &quot;  - areas in which fishing is prohibited altogether . 
As fish populations in these no-take zones recover , they create &quot; spill-over &quot; effects , with catches often increasing in areas outside the no-take zones . 
More importantly , they provide a refuge for fish populations , a kind of insurance policy against stock collapse . 
On coral reefs , these no-take zones can help insure that a portion of coral reef habitat sustains a healthy fish community , and secure the coral reef resilience that this brings . 
Scientific evidence indicates that , to be effective , 30-50 % of available habitat should be set aside as no-take zones . 
This figure is far higher than levels of protection in even the wealthiest countries that harbor significant coral reefs , the US and Australia , where current levels of protection are less than 5 % . 
Given the magnitude of the threat to the world &apos;s coral reefs , the international community &apos;s response has been frighteningly slow . 
But there is some encouraging news : in June , Australia &apos;s government proposed a major increase in no-take areas within the Great Barrier Reef to over 30 % . 
If adopted , this policy would set a new global standard and perhaps prompt other nations to follow suit . 
The future of tropical marine ecosystems , and the millions of people whose lives are linked to them , depend on it .
