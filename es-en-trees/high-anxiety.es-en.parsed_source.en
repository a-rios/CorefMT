High Anxiety 
CHICAGO - The United States has reached a point where almost half its population is described as being in some way mentally ill , and nearly a quarter of its citizens - 67.5 million - have taken antidepressants . 
These eye-popping statistics have sparked a widespread , sometimes rancorous debate about whether people are taking far more medication than is needed for problems that may not even be mental disorders . 
Studies indicate that 40 % of all patients fall short of the diagnoses that doctors and psychiatrists give them , yet 200 million prescriptions are still written annually in the US to treat depression and anxiety . 
Those who defend such widespread use of prescription drugs insist that a significant part of the population is under-treated and , by inference , under-medicated . 
Those opposed to such rampant use of drugs note that diagnostic rates for bipolar disorder , in particular , have skyrocketed by 4,000 % and that overmedication is impossible without over-diagnosis . 
To help settle this long-standing dispute , I studied why the number of recognized psychiatric disorders has ballooned so dramatically in recent decades . 
In 1980 , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders added 112 new mental disorders to its third edition ( DSM-III ) . 
Fifty-eight more disorders appeared in the revised third ( 1987 ) and fourth ( 1994 ) editions . 
With over a million copies in print , the manual is known as the bible of American psychiatry ; certainly it is an invoked chapter and verse in schools , prisons , courts , and by mental-health professionals around the world . 
The addition of even one new diagnostic code has serious practical consequences . 
What , then , was the rationale for adding so many in 1980 ? 
After several requests to the American Psychiatric Association , I was granted complete access to the hundreds of unpublished memos , letters , and even votes from the period between 1973 and 1979 , when the DSM-III task force debated each new and existing disorder . 
Some of the work was meticulous and commendable . 
DSM-III grew out of meetings that many participants described as chaotic . 
One observer later remarked that the small amount of research drawn upon was &quot; really a hodgepodge -scattered , inconsistent , and ambiguous . &quot; 
The interest and expertise of the task force was limited to one branch of psychiatry : neuropsychiatry . 
That group met for four years before it occurred to members that such one-sidedness might result in bias . 
Incredibly , the lists of symptoms for some disorders were knocked out in minutes . 
The field studies used to justify their inclusion sometimes involved a single patient evaluated by the person advocating the new disease . 
Experts pressed for the inclusion of illnesses as questionable as &quot; chronic undifferentiated unhappiness disorder &quot; and &quot; chronic complaint disorder , &quot; whose traits included moaning about taxes , the weather , and even sports results . 
Social phobia ( later dubbed &quot; social anxiety disorder &quot; ) was one of seven new anxiety disorders created in 1980 . 
At first it struck me as a serious condition . 
By the 1990 &quot; s experts were calling it &quot; the disorder of the decade , &quot; insisting that as many as one in five Americans suffers from it . 
Yet the complete story turned out to be rather more complicated . 
For starters , the specialist who in the 1960 &quot; s originally recognized social anxiety ( London-based Isaac Marks , a renowned expert on fear and panic ) strongly resisted its inclusion in DSM-III as a separate disease category . 
The list of common behaviors associated with the disorder gave him pause : fear of eating alone in restaurants , avoidance of public toilets , and concern about trembling hands . 
By the time a revised task force added dislike of public speaking in 1987 , the disorder seemed sufficiently elastic to include virtually everyone on the planet . 
To counter the impression that it was turning common fears into treatable conditions , DSM-IV added a clause stipulating that social anxiety behaviors had to be &quot; impairing &quot; before a diagnosis was possible . 
Doubtless , their understanding of impairment was looser than that of the task force . 
After all , despite the impairment clause , the anxiety disorder mushroomed ; by 2000 , it was the third most common psychiatric disorder in America , behind only depression and alcoholism . 
Over-medication would affect fewer Americans if we could rein in such clear examples of over-diagnosis . 
We would have to set the thresholds for psychiatric diagnosis a lot higher , resurrecting the distinction between chronic illness and mild suffering . 
Failure to reform psychiatry will be disastrous for public health . 
Consider that apathy , excessive shopping , and overuse of the Internet are all serious contenders for inclusion in the next edition of the DSM , due to appear in 2012 . 
If the history of psychiatry is any guide , a new class of medication will soon be touted to treat them . 
Sanity must prevail : if everyone is mentally ill , then no one is .
