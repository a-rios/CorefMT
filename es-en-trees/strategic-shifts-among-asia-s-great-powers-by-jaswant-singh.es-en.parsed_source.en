Asia &apos;s Game Without Frontiers 
NEW DELHI - Nowadays , many people seem to be more relaxed than ever about nationality , with the Internet enabling them to forge close connections with distant cultures and people . 
After all , territory - including land , oceans , air space , rivers , and seabeds - is central to a country &apos;s identity , and shapes its security and foreign policy . 
States can respond to territorial disputes either by surrendering some aspects of sovereignty , thus weakening their power and influence , or by adopting a more robust national-defense strategy aimed at fending off current challenges and precluding future threats . 
Today , many Asian countries are choosing the latter option . 
Consider the territorial disputes roiling the Indian Ocean and other East Asian regions , sparked by China &apos;s repeated - and increasingly assertive - efforts to claim sovereignty over vast maritime areas . 
As China &apos;s incursions reignite long-smoldering disagreements and threaten to destabilize the regional status quo , countries throughout Asia are reconsidering their strategic positions . 
For example , the Philippines is revamping its security strategy by enhancing cooperation with the United States - China &apos;s counterweight in the region - only two decades after it closed two major American military installations , the naval base at Subic Bay and Clark Air Base . 
Vietnam , too , has strengthened its ties with the US . 
More significant , Japan &apos;s leaders are now openly debating ways to transform the country &apos;s post-World War II pacifism into a much more assertive nationalism . 
In fact , in August , the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force unveiled the helicopter destroyer Izumo , whose structure and capabilities resemble those of an aircraft carrier , with possible offensive applications . 
This emerging strategic shift will likely have far-reaching consequences , raising the stakes of Sino-Japanese sparring over islands in the East China Sea . 
But , while Japan &apos;s tense relationship with China dominates headlines worldwide , the strategic rivalry between China and India is more likely to shape Asian power dynamics in the coming decades . 
In April , a platoon of Chinese People &apos;s Liberation Army ( PLA ) border-security personnel crossed the so-called &quot; line of actual control &quot; into India &apos;s Depsang Valley in Ladakh to erect an encampment , where they remained for almost three weeks . 
China &apos;s leaders have yet to explain what prompted the incursion - but there is no shortage of speculation . 
Some claim that the local PLA commander initiated the &quot; stand-off , &quot; while others contend that China &apos;s new president , Xi Jinping , was using the transgression to assert his authority over the PLA . 
The incursion has even been linked to the scandal surrounding Chongqing &apos;s disgraced former Communist Party chief , Bo Xilai , who had close ties with high-ranking PLA and security-services officers . 
As it stands , India and China are openly competing for influence in Sri Lanka , Myanmar , Nepal , and Bangladesh . 
So far , they have largely relied on economic and commercial mechanisms - especially rival port and pipeline projects - to secure their positions . 
China is not allowing its economic slowdown to derail its efforts to enlarge and modernize its navy and expand its commercial interests around Eurasia &apos;s southern rim . 
It has been investing or demonstrating interest in deep-water port projects in Kenya , Tanzania , and Bangladesh , and it has been directly involved in financing and constructing Indian Ocean ports in Myanmar , Sri Lanka , and Pakistan . 
Just as China is helping to develop Pakistan &apos;s port of Gwadar , India is helping to develop Iran &apos;s Chabahar port 70 kilometers ( 43.5 miles ) away . 
Chabahar is not useful only to counter China ; it will serve as a vital link for India to transport goods to Afghanistan , Central Asia , and beyond . 
India could even develop a major communication hub with the port as its nexus . 
Moreover , India is working to safeguard its naval superiority over China . 
In August , the reactor aboard India &apos;s first indigenously built nuclear submarine , INS Arihant , was activated , bringing the country one step closer to realizing its long-sought goal of a &quot; nuclear triad &quot; - the capability to launch nuclear weapons from land , air , and sea . 
Just three days later , India launched the aircraft carrier INS Vikrant . 
But , as The Economist observed , &quot; rarely does nemesis follow hubris so quickly . &quot; 
Indeed , just two days after the Vikrant &apos;s launch , explosions at the naval dockyard in Mumbai sank INS Sindhurakshak - one of the ten Kilo-class submarines that form the backbone of India &apos;s aging conventional-submarine fleet - killing 18 crew members . 
Perhaps China &apos;s apparent economic , strategic , and military advantages will prove less significant than many believe - especially given continuing uncertainty over the terms of America &apos;s strategic &quot; pivot &quot; toward Asia . 
Indeed , with the US on their side , either Japan or India could conceivably tip the scales in its own favor .
