Argentina the Outcast 
BRASILIA - Roughly 20 years ago , an important Argentine minister startled a newly arrived Brazilian ambassador by telling him that &quot; Argentina is prodigal in three things : meat , wheat , and insane gestures . &quot; 
The decision to expropriate 51 % of YPF , Argentina &apos;s biggest energy firm , from the Spanish company Repsol is one of those gestures . 
Added to its contempt for foreign creditors , and to the growing and arbitrary protectionism that violates all global and regional rules , President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner &apos;s decision pushes Argentina closer to being deemed internationally as a lawless country . 
Whatever their short-term benefits and popularity , gestures of such gravity always entail serious long-term consequences . 
In particular , they risk cutting a country off from the main flows of credit , investment , and commerce - that is , all of the activities that generate economic opportunity and prosperity . 
Bad governments are always guided by their yearning for an immediate surge in popularity , regardless of the future costs . 
Argentina &apos;s governments have made this a habit ever since Juan Perón first came to power in 1946 . 
Indeed , as a result of Fernández &apos;s decision , Argentina now finds itself ostracized in international energy and financial markets . 
Unable to provide either the investment or technological resources and knowhow to develop YPF &apos;s resources , her government must invite others to fill the financial and technological void created by Repsol &apos;s forced eviction . 
But any international corporation that participates in exploiting the assets stripped from Repsol would face serious legal problems . 
Brazil &apos;s energy giant Petrobrás , one of the largest corporations in the world , was publicly invited to expand its production in Argentina through new investments . 
Petrobrás , with its global interests , could never accept this invitation , particularly given its effort to obtain the financing that it needs to develop Brazil &apos;s immense offshore oil reserves . 
Sinopec , China &apos;s second largest oil company , was reportedly holding discussions with Repsol to acquire a substantial share of its assets in Argentina . 
As an unnamed Chinese source told Reuters , &quot; this is a challenging situation for anyone , given the action taken by the government . 
For me , it would be political suicide to allow a Chinese company to prospect YPF control rights after the nationalization announcement . &quot; 
Repsol was gravely harmed by Fernández &apos;s action , having lost about 50 % of its productive capacity and a third of its income . 
Spain &apos;s government , outraged , promises strong retaliation , and will certainly have the European Union &apos;s political support . 
But it is hard to imagine what measures could actually lead Fernández to reconsider . 
After all , given that all of this was predictable , and that foreign investors will now be even more reticent to enter the market , she has clearly calculated that the political benefits outweigh the economic costs . 
But that depends on whether nationalization brings about an increase in production . 
It seems clear that it will not , unless the government decides to inject massive fiscal resources into YPF at the expense of other pressing needs . 
Given that this is unlikely , supply shortages are inevitable . 
Oil stirs great popular fascination . 
For countries that possess it in abundance , it is one of the most solid and central pillars of nationalism . 
And , everywhere , it is the real or imaginary explanation for many wars , the &quot; black gold &quot; that fuels dreams and awakens greed . 
For rulers who don &apos;t care if their victories are Pyrrhic , it is also an easily accessible resource for manipulating the public imagination with conspiracy theories and patriotic posturing . 
The Fernández government has been sending signals that it is determined to continue on its erratic course , not only creating chaos in the economy , but also marginalizing the country in the eyes of the international community . 
But decisions like this , which sometimes seem to start well , invariably end badly . 
Personally , I am deeply sorry that Argentina has ventured into this realm of mistakes and delusions . 
It is a great country , with sophisticated and highly accomplished people in all fields . 
For Brazil , there can be no satisfaction in seeing so close a neighbor separate itself from international law and engage in dangerous adventures , to the ultimate detriment of its own people .
