Truce and Truth in Venezuela 
President Hugo Chávez was forced from power not because of opposition protests but because of his own mistakes . 
He returned to power two days later because of his opponents &apos; mistakes . 
Understanding the positions of the actors is a necessary step if today &apos;s impasse is to be bridged . 
By 2001 &apos;s end , a growing but dispersed opposition believed that President Chávez should go but disagreed how this should happen . 
Their complaints were many : the government &apos;s land reform law , its oil policy , poor record on corruption , politicization and militarization of the public sector , disrespect for unions and other institutions , support for guerrillas in Colombia and for Fidel Castro , illegal arming of militants , hostility to the US , and threats to free speech . 
Even though the charges were serious , the opposition lacked a smoking gun to clearly disqualify President Chávez , especially in the eyes of foreign governments . 
President Chávez scorned the opposition &apos;s litany . 
His legitimacy rested on free elections and his project for economic and social justice . 
He predicted resistance from those whose privileges would disappear . 
They would seek to block him , especially through their control of the media . 
He would respect their right to say as they pleased but would pull no punches in countering their &quot; lies . &quot; 
He used his appearances on television to denounce his enemies and mobilize citizens , particularly poor ones , to support his revolution . 
He sowed conflict . 
The tide of events shifted to favor the opposition and facilitate coordination among its disparate parts , including politicians , business leaders , civil society organizations , active and retired military officials , intellectuals , labor unions and even members of religious groups . 
A successful national strike last December convinced many that the president no longer commanded a majority among voters . 
Chávez responded with intransigence , seeming to think that his hold on power depended on whether he could still turn out a big crowd . 
Like a flawed hero , Chávez fell prey to his aggressive character in ways that endangered his international standing . 
In mid-February , the Organization of American States criticized his abusive language in television broadcasts that chilled public debate . 
Shortly after , Chávez recklessly decided to consolidate his hold on the state oil company by appointing cronies to its board . 
The move sparked a managerial revolt that threatened Venezuela &apos;s biggest source of income . 
Smelling blood , business and labor leaders called for a national strike to support the company . 
Any observer could see that the march of several hundred thousand people on the presidential palace on April 11 th would likely provoke repression and a clash with Chávez supporters . 
As violence exploded , Chávez began a television address announcing the shutdown of private television stations ; meanwhile the media projected scenes of blood and chaos on one half of the TV screen and afterwards reported that snipers were firing against the defenseless crowd . 
Here , at last , was the smoking gun . 
Or so it seemed . 
Representatives of the armed forces announced that , as defenders of the constitution , they could not support the president . 
After announcing that the president had resigned , they charged Pedro Carmona , head of the businessmen &apos;s federation , with forming a government . 
Many people expected that Venezuela would follow the example of several Latin American countries by respecting constitutional procedures to legitimize a new government . 
No one can understand why Carmona abandoned his allies , entrenched a narrow group of associates in his proposed government , or declared himself virtual dictator for a year instead of following the democratic script . 
He thus validated the condemnation of Latin American leaders and lost vital military and political support even before he swore himself in . 
The next day , chaos , looting and panic spread . 
Arbitrary arrests of Chávez officials began , even as their colleagues regrouped to retake the presidential palace . 
The news media suspiciously stopped reporting on these facts , later protesting ( too much ) that they were under threat and feared instigating further violence . 
Unwilling to go to war amongst themselves or against the enraged crowds , the military brought back the president as the only hope for restoring order . 
A repentant Chávez sought pardon for his errors , promised generous treatment for the rebels and moved swiftly to negotiate a solution for the oil industry . 
But his return leaves the political constellation of forces much as before . 
The dictatorial turn of the transitional government fortified the view in the Chávez camp that the opposition is a tool of right-wing economic groups and opportunists willing to turn confused citizens into cannon fodder . 
For the opposition , the government &apos;s attempts to close down the media strips bare Chávez &apos;s anti-democratic credentials . 
They blame the president for the dead and wounded on both sides and consider him incapable of changing his ways or his policies , despite his promises . 
A fragile consensus for conciliation and an independent commission to investigate the facts opens a window for dialogue , but no one thinks the crisis has ended . 
Many on both sides may prefer that the full facts not come out . 
Early elections would divert attention from a serious effort to discover what really happened , although a new cabinet and resignations by autonomous judicial and investigative bodies would help restore faith in these key institutions . 
They would help Venezuela to let the truth to emerge , no matter what the truth may be .
