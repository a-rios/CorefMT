Europe , Italian-Style 
MILAN - Last summer , after two years of growing uncertainty , systemic risk in the eurozone finally began to wane , as conditional commitments came together . 
Italy and Spain offered credible fiscal and growth-oriented reforms , and the European Central Bank , with Germany &apos;s backing , promised intervention as needed to stabilize the banking sector and sovereign-debt markets . 
Unfortunately , that trend may be reversing . 
Growth in the eurozone has turned negative overall , significantly so in the south . 
Unemployment stands at about 12 % in Italy , and 38 % for the young . 
Likewise , Spain &apos;s unemployment rate is above 25 % ( and 55 % for young people ) . 
And French economic indicators are slipping quickly . 
Meanwhile , the outcome of Italy &apos;s election will most likely leave the country - the eurozone &apos;s third-largest economy and the world &apos;s third-largest sovereign-debt market - without a stable government . 
As a result , it will be difficult to sustain a reform program that is vigorous enough to satisfy the ECB and the eurozone core . 
Surprisingly ( to me , at least ) , markets have reacted stoically . 
Interest-rate spreads on Italian sovereign debt have widened , but not sharply . 
External investors may not be rushing for the exits , but they are not piling in , either . 
It feels like wait and see at this point . 
Italy is the only debt-distressed eurozone country in which the negative competitiveness trends ( productivity relative to income ) have not reversed direction in the post-crisis period . 
With a debt / GDP ratio of more than 120 % , Italy lacks the flexibility to implement fiscal stimulus to bridge the transition to higher growth . 
Outgoing Prime Minister Mario Monti &apos;s government accomplished a major pension reform , cut public spending , and raised taxes . 
But Italian voters overwhelmingly rejected his approach , in part because austerity did not appear to extend to elected officials or to major parts of the large ecosystem of departments , enterprises , and unions that surround government . 
Systemic reform of Italy &apos;s government may be a prerequisite to achieving consensus on a path to fiscal health and growth . 
But this is not the ideal moment for a timeout to do that . 
The real issues , in any case , are distributional and reflect a shortage of policy instruments . 
For example , tax evasion is pervasive , so increases disproportionately hit those who already pay , fueling a widespread perception of unfairness . 
Monti attempted to address this , but moving from the current equilibrium to a better one , in which tax evasion is the exception rather than the norm , is a long-term project . 
As a result , the burden of the crisis is being borne mainly by the unemployed and the young . 
Given Italy &apos;s adverse competitiveness position , devaluation of the currency , were it possible , would not be a long-term substitute for productivity-boosting reforms , but it certainly would help in at least three ways . 
First , devaluation would distribute the costs of rebalancing more evenly , making it easier to clear the burden-sharing hurdle to deeper reforms . 
Second , floating exchange rates imply that devaluation is an automatic adjustment mechanism , so it occurs without the appearance of an explicit burden-sharing choice and the accompanying potential for political gridlock . 
Finally , as is true in many of the advanced countries , weak demand constrains Italy &apos;s short- and medium-term growth . 
This means that , unless government spending provides the demand bridge , the large non-tradable part of the economy cannot drive growth and job creation . 
But Italy &apos;s government , like that of the United States and other fiscally constrained countries , is subtracting effective demand . 
Some parts of the global economy are growing . 
So a negative domestic demand shock need not completely constrain the roughly one-third of the Italian economy that is tradable - and thus could grow and generate employment if the competiveness parameters were reset quickly . 
Obviously , in the context of the eurozone , this is not an option . 
The alternative is muted wage and income growth shared across the income spectrum , combined with productivity-enhancing measures . 
This was a component of Germany &apos;s successful reform program of a decade ago , which included labor-market and social-security reforms , the combined effect of which was to restore competitiveness and growth potential in the tradable sector , while improving productivity on the non-tradable side . 
This process does work in the long run . 
But Germany &apos;s reforms took place in a much healthier global economy , and , when the initial divergences are large , it may take too long to restore growth . 
Some observers have argued for a higher stable inflation target in the eurozone to facilitate the &quot; relative deflation &quot; process in countries that need it , and to put the &quot; zero bound &quot; on interest rates further away , thereby enhancing the potential impact of monetary policy . 
But inflation has its own adverse distributional and efficiency implications , and would be fiercely resisted . 
It is hard to see how this ends well . 
The alternatives seem to be a lengthy and difficult return to growth and employment , or declining enthusiasm for the common currency . 
Beyond that , the main lessons concern design flaws . 
In the eurozone , for the most part , national governments separately choose investment levels in infrastructure , education , research , and technology . 
Their labor-market , social-welfare , and competition policies vary . 
All affect the trajectories of growth , income , and employment . 
So , even if the eurozone &apos;s structure is modified to achieve the desired level of fiscal discipline and balance , in its current highly decentralized structure , countries will continue to diverge in other important respects . 
Divergence in policies and convergence in outcomes is not a realistic expectation . 
Adjustment mechanisms are needed , but external devaluation and inflation are not available , while labor mobility is partial at best . 
Perhaps one could interpret the common currency as &quot; forcing &quot; eventual convergence in policies . 
But , realistically , loss of support for the euro might come first , precisely because the adjustment mechanisms are so limited . 
No one doubts the depth of Europe &apos;s official long-run commitment to integration . 
The huge design challenge is to find the right level of mandatory policy convergence - one that works economically and is acceptable politically .
