Are Israel and Syria Ready for Peace ? 
JERUSALEM - The resumption of peace talks between Israel and Syria after eight years of saber-rattling is not a diversion from the political troubles of Israel &apos;s lame-duck prime minister . 
Nor are the talks a Syrian ploy to avoid facing an international tribunal on the assassination of Lebanon &apos;s former prime minister , Rafik Hariri . 
An Israeli-Syrian peace deal is strategically vital for both sides , and both sides know it . 
The two major formative experiences of Syria &apos;s Ba &apos;ath regime have been Hafez al-Assad &apos;s loss of the Golan Heights in the 1967 war with Israel , and the loss of Lebanon by his son , Bashar , who was forced to withdraw his army under irresistible American-led international pressure . 
Recovering the Golan Heights and protecting Syria &apos;s vital interests in Lebanon are not only major strategic concerns for Syria &apos;s president ; they are also crucial to the regime &apos;s drive for national legitimacy , and to Bashar &apos;s assertion of his own leadership . 
Peace with Israel is not Assad &apos;s priority . 
Indeed , the regime has hinted that it may be willing to compromise on the issue - the delineation of the 1967 border along a tiny piece of land on the Eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee - that wrecked the negotiations eight years ago . 
An Israeli-Syrian peace is a weighty strategic necessity for Israel , too . 
The complexities of the threats to Israel are such that a possible confrontation with Hamas in Gaza might trigger a flare-up with Hezbollah in Lebanon . 
In that case , Syria would likely seize the opportunity to break the deadlock over the Golan Heights through a military move that could develop into a massive war of missiles targeting Israel &apos;s vulnerable home front . 
And Iran , in its drive to protect its nuclear program from an Israeli-American attack , might be very active in supporting this ominous scenario . 
Admittedly , the strategic conditions in the region are far more complex today than they were eight years ago , when Israel &apos;s requirements for a deal with Syria focused mainly on security arrangements on the Golan Heights , and on Syria using its leverage in Lebanon to permit an Israeli settlement with that country . 
Syria &apos;s alliance with Iran was not a major issue . 
Syria &apos;s subsequent forced withdrawal from Lebanon was not good news for Israel . 
In the last round of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks eight years ago , it was clear that a deal with Syria would automatically pave the way to a settlement with Lebanon , and an end to Hezbollah &apos;s threat to Israel &apos;s northern border . 
Today , peace with Syria might facilitate an Israeli peace with Lebanon down the road , but that will not be an automatic outcome . 
Indeed , while Hezbollah prospered under Syrian occupation , it never reached the extraordinary political power that it has today . 
Nevertheless , peace with Syria could be a major building block in a wider Israeli-Arab settlement , and consequently of a more stable Middle East , though it is unrealistic to expect that Syria would automatically sever its special relationship with Iran in exchange for the Golan Heights . 
These are peace talks , not a defense treaty , and Syria would not abruptly disengage from its Iranian friends . 
But good relations between an Arab state at peace with Israel and Iran are not necessarily a bad thing . 
Syria &apos;s stance might limit , rather than extend , the reach of Iran &apos;s strategy of regional destabilization . 
As always , much will depend on America &apos;s readiness to move away from military solutions and rigid ideological imperatives and instead embrace the pragmatic culture of conflict resolution . 
A US-backed Israeli-Syrian peace could transform the strategic environment , potentially drawing other Middle East spoilers into a system of regional cooperation and security .
