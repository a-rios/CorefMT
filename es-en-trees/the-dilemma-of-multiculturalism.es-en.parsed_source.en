The Dilemma of Multiculturalism 
Many people have suddenly become very hesitant about using the term &quot; multicultural society . &quot; 
July &apos;s terrorist attacks in London demonstrated both the strength and the weakness of the concept . 
London is certainly a multicultural metropolis . 
An indiscriminate attack such as a bomb in the Underground will necessarily hit people of many cultural backgrounds and beliefs . 
Sitting , or more likely standing , in the &quot; tube &quot; ( as London &apos;s Underground is affectionately known ) , one never ceases to be amazed at the ease with which Jewish mothers and Muslim men , West Indian youngsters and South Asian businessmen , and many others endure the same stressful conditions and try to lighten its impact by being civil to one another . 
The terror attacks demonstrated not only how particular people helped each other , but also how the whole city , with all the ingredients of its human mixture , displayed a common spirit of resilience . 
This is the positive side of a multicultural society . 
Careful observers have always noted that it is strictly confined to the public sphere , to life in those parts of the city that are shared by all . 
It does not extend in quite the same way to people &apos;s homes , let alone to their ways of life in the private sphere . 
This is one reason why London has experienced the other , darker side of the multicultural society : the veneer of multiculturalism is thin . 
It does not take much to turn people of one group against those of others with whom they had apparently lived in peace . 
We know this because it lies at the core of the murderous environment that gripped the Balkans in the 1990 &quot; s . 
For decades ( and in some cases much longer ) , Serbs and Croats , - indeed , Orthodox , Catholic , and Muslim &quot; Yugoslavs &quot; - had lived together as neighbors . 
Few thought it possible that they would turn against each other in a bloodletting of such brutal enormity that it is very unlikely that Bosnia-Herzegovina can ever become a successful multicultural society . 
Yet it happened , and in a different way it is happening now in Britain . 
It is important to recognize that we are not talking about the return of age-old hostilities . 
Ethnic and cultural conflicts today , often in the form of terrorism , are not the eruption of a supposedly extinct volcano . 
They are , on the contrary , a specifically modern phenomenon . 
For the terrorists themselves , such conflicts are one consequence of the unsettling effects of modernization . 
Beneath the veneer of integration into a multicultural environment , many people - especially young men with an immigrant background - are lost in the world of contradictions around them . 
Their seamless , all-embracing world of tradition is gone , but they are not yet confident citizens of the modern , individualistic world . 
The question is not primarily one of employment , or even poverty , but of marginalization and alienation , of the lack of a sense of belonging . 
It is in such circumstances that the key feature of terrorism comes into play : the preaching of hate by often self-appointed leaders . 
They are not necessarily religious leaders ; in the Balkans and elsewhere , they are nationalists who preach the superiority of one nationality over others . 
But to call these hate-mongers &quot; preachers &quot; is fitting nonetheless , because they invariably appeal to higher values to sanctify criminal acts . 
The mobilization of criminal energies by such preachers of hate is itself a modern phenomenon . 
It is a far cry even from such doubtful claims as the self-determination of peoples defined as ethnic communities . 
Hate preachers use highly modern methods to enhance their personal power and to create havoc around them . 
But countering them does not involve warfare , or even a rhetorically looser &quot; war on terror . &quot; 
Of course , part of the answer is to identify the relatively small number of people who are prepared to use their lives to destroy the lives of others without distinction or purpose . 
But the more important issue is to identify the preachers of hate and stop their murderous incitement . 
This is why it is so important to capture and prosecute Radovan Karadzic , who spurred on the homicidal rage of so many Bosnian Serbs . 
And this is why militant Islamist preachers must be stopped . 
Beyond this carefully targeted - and , in principle , limited - task , there remains the need to strengthen the sphere of common values and cooperation in societies that will , after all , remain multicultural . 
This will be difficult , and it must not be approached naively . 
Differences will not - and need not - go away ; but ensuring that all citizens can rely on each other requires us to find a way to extend and bolster the civic trust that we see in the public sphere .
