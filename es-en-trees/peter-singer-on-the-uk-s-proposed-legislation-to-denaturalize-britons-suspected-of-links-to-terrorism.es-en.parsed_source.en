Is Citizenship a Right ? 
MELBOURNE - Should your government be able to take away your citizenship ? 
In the United Kingdom , the government has had the legal authority to revoke naturalized Britons &quot; citizenship since 1918 . 
Since then , the British government has revoked the citizenship of 42 people , including 20 cases in 2013 . 
British Home Secretary Theresa May has said that citizenship is &quot; a privilege , not a right . &quot; 
Most of the 42 held dual nationality . 
Mohamed Sakr , however , did not . 
His parents came to Britain from Egypt , but he was not an Egyptian citizen . 
Therefore , by stripping him of citizenship , the UK government made him stateless . 
Sakr appealed the decision from Somalia , where he was living . 
His case was strong , because the UK Supreme Court subsequently ruled in a different case that the government does not have the power to make a person stateless . 
Nevertheless , Sakr discontinued his appeal , apparently because he was concerned that the use of his cellphone was revealing his location to US intelligence services . 
Months later , while still in Somalia , he was killed in an American drone attack . 
Now , partly in response to fears that Britons who have joined the fighting in Syria may return to carry out terrorism at home , the government has proposed legislation enabling it to revoke the citizenship of naturalized Britons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities - even if this makes them stateless . 
( Since the start of the year , more than 40 Britons have been arrested on suspicion of engaging in military activities in Syria . ) 
The House of Commons passed the legislation in January , but in April the House of Lords voted to send it to a joint parliamentary committee for additional scrutiny . 
In the United States , citizenship can be revoked only on limited grounds , such as fraud committed in the citizenship application or service in another country &apos;s military . 
Arguably , joining a terrorist organization hostile to the US is even worse than joining a foreign army , because terrorist organizations are more likely to target civilians . 
But one important difference is that if people who join other countries &quot; military forces lose their US citizenship , they can presumably become citizens of the country for which they are fighting . 
Terrorist organizations usually have no such ties to a particular government . 
The 1961 United Nations Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness , to which Britain is a signatory , does allow countries to declare their citizens stateless if it is proved that they have done something &quot; prejudicial to the vital interests of the country . &quot; 
The legislation currently before the UK Parliament does not require any judicial or public proof even of the weaker claim that someone &apos;s presence in the country is not conducive to the public good . 
Should the person whose citizenship is revoked mount an appeal , the government is not required to disclose to the appellant the evidence on which it has based its decision . 
Though governments are bound to make mistakes from time to time in such cases , judges or tribunals will be unable to probe the evidence put before them . 
Another , more sinister possibility is deliberate abuse of these powers to get rid of citizens whose presence in the country is merely inconvenient . 
There is a strong case for an appeal system that allows for full and fair review of decisions to revoke citizenship . 
The ability to revoke citizenship without presenting any evidence in public is one reason why a government may prefer this course to arresting and trying terrorism suspects . 
The larger question raised by the UK &apos;s proposed legislation is the desirable balance between individual rights , including the right to citizenship , and the public good . 
Suppose that the government gets it right 19 times out of 20 when it relies on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities to revoke people &apos;s citizenship . 
If that were the case with the decisions made by the UK government in 2013 , there would still be a high probability that an innocent naturalized citizen was made stateless . 
That is a grave injustice . 
Suppose , however , that the 19 people correctly suspected of involvement in terrorism were able to return to Britain , and one carried out a terrorist attack similar to the London transport bombings , which killed 52 innocent people ( the four bombers also died ) . 
In the face of such atrocities , it is difficult to insist that individual rights are absolute . 
Is it better to have one innocent person unjustly made stateless , or to have 52 innocent people killed and many others injured ? 
The much greater harm done by the terrorist attack cannot be ignored ; but when a democratic government starts to revoke citizenship and make people stateless , it sets a precedent for authoritarian regimes that wish to rid themselves of dissidents by expelling them , as the former Soviet Union did to the poet and later Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky - among many others . 
In the absence of global citizenship , it may be best to retain the principle that citizenship is not to be revoked without a judicial hearing .
