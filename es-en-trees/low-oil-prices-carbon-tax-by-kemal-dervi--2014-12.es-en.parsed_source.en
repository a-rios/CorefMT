The Oil Price Opportunity 
WASHINGTON , DC - The sharp drop in the price of crude oil since late June has been grabbing headlines worldwide - and producing a lot of contradictory explanations . 
Some attribute the fall largely to declining global growth expectations . 
Others focus on the expansion of America &apos;s oil and gas production . 
Still others suspect a tacit agreement between Saudi Arabia and the United States aimed at , among other things , weakening political rivals like Russia and Iran . 
Regardless of the reason for the price drop - probably to be found in some combination of these factors - the consequences are the same . 
Though , as International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde has noted , lower oil prices may boost overall global growth , with the oil-importing advanced economies gaining the most , the impact on efforts to combat climate change could be devastating . 
Indeed , a sustained decline in oil prices would not only make renewable energy sources less competitive now ; it would impede their future competitiveness by discouraging research and investment . 
More generally , it would reduce the incentive for consumers , companies , and governments to pursue more energy-efficient practices . 
Even if we remained on our current trajectory , keeping temperatures from rising more than 2ยบ Celsius above pre-industrial levels - the threshold beyond which the most disruptive consequences of climate change would be triggered - would be next to impossible to achieve . 
As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change &apos;s most recent report reinforced , we cannot afford a slowdown in progress . 
Of course , climate science is not precise ; instead , it works in terms of probability ranges . 
But uncertain estimates do not mean that the risk is any less acute . 
World leaders increasingly seem to recognize this in theory , including at the just-concluded climate-change meeting in Lima , Peru . 
But they continue to depend on non-binding commitments - leaving the world on a dangerous climate trajectory . 
A sharp decline in oil prices does , however , provide a rare political opportunity to introduce more carbon pricing . 
After all , one of the major arguments against a &quot; carbon tax &quot; has been that it would make energy more expensive . 
Even assurances that the revenue from such a tax would be refunded to taxpayers were inadequate to overcome political resistance , particularly in the US . 
But , with declining oil prices now exerting downward pressure on oil substitutes , a carbon tax could be introduced without raising the price of energy for consumers . 
Policymakers must simply be willing to forego some of the short-term stimulus effects of cheaper energy . 
In fact , with low enough prices , consumers could still benefit from lower energy costs - just not quite as much as they are now . 
The structure of a carbon-pricing scheme remains up for discussion . 
One option would be to introduce flexible pricing , tied to the price of oil . 
For example , for every $ 5 decline in the price per barrel , the carbon tax could be raised by a specified amount ; for every $ 5 increase , the tax could be lowered by , say , two-thirds of that amount . 
The carbon price would thus increase over time - the optimal outcome , according to growth models that account for climate constraints . 
At the same time , it would buffer consumers from oil-price volatility , thereby stabilizing their energy spending . 
Finally , and perhaps most important , such an approach would be more politically attractive than a fixed carbon tax , especially if it is introduced at a time of sharply declining oil prices . 
In short , world leaders must take advantage of falling oil prices to move beyond indirect carbon pricing - achieved through the prices of carbon-emitting substances - to an explicit carbon tax that can help steer the world onto a more sustainable growth path . 
Crucially , in order to make a real impact , carbon-pricing schemes would have to be introduced in all major economies . 
Of course , given the multitude of existing taxes , fees , and subsidies on energy products in various countries , the goal of aligning the effective cost of carbon with its most economically efficient level would take time to achieve . 
But introducing a modest , flexible carbon tax in major economies would be an important first step . 
Today &apos;s environment of falling oil prices enables the world to take that step . 
It should be modest , so that it is politically feasible ; flexible , so that it helps stabilize user prices ; and it should increase over time , to place the global economy on a more sustainable path . 
Most important , it should be implemented quickly . 
After all , this window of opportunity will not remain open for very long .
