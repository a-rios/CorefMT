The Congress of Vienna Revisited 
PARIS - Two hundred years ago , on September 25 , 1814 , Russia &apos;s Czar Alexander I and Friedrich Wilhelm III , the King of Prussia , were greeted at the gates of Vienna by Austria &apos;s Emperor Franz I. The start of the Congress of Vienna ushered in the longest period of peace Europe had known for centuries . 
So why has its anniversary all but been ignored ? 
True , the Congress of Vienna is mostly viewed as marking the victory of Europe &apos;s reactionary forces after the defeat of Napoleon . 
Yet , given today &apos;s growing global confusion , if not chaos , something like &quot; Proustian &quot; nostalgia for the Congress may not be out of order . 
Here , after all , was a meeting that , through tough but successful negotiations , reestablished international order after the upheavals caused by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars . 
Can we apply any of its lessons today ? 
To answer that question , we should consider not just the 1815 Treaty of Vienna , but also the 1648 Peace of Westphalia and the 1919 Treaty of Versailles , each of which in its own way brought to an end a bloody chapter in European history . 
The treaties signed in 1648 concluded nearly a century of religious warfare by enshrining the principle of cuius regio , eius religio ( &quot; whose realm , his religion &quot; ) . 
The Congress of Vienna reinstated the principle of the balance of power , based on the belief that all parties shared a common interest transcending their respective ambitions , and re-established the Concert of Nations , which for two generations stopped territorial and ideological revisionism of the type seen from 1789 to 1815 . 
By contrast , the Treaty of Versailles , too harsh to be honored and too weak to be enforced , paved the way for World War II . 
Of the three treaties , the one produced by the Congress of Vienna offers a sort of mirror image to help us understand the specificity of our current conditions . 
In Vienna , the European powers were among themselves . 
Their feeling of belonging to a great and unified family was reinforced by the common aristocratic origins of their diplomats . 
The cultural &quot; other &quot; was not an issue . 
Of course , the ambition today cannot be to recreate that world ( or to reestablish an anachronistic Westphalian order of religious separation ) , but rather to devise a new order predicated on different assumptions . 
Indeed , one of the keys to our current global disorder is that , in contrast to the Congress of Vienna - or , for that matter , the parties of 1648 - the international system &apos;s main actors are not united by a common will to defend the status quo . 
The main actors fall into three categories : open revisionists , like Russia and the Islamic State ; those ready to fight to protect a minimum of order , such as the United States , France , and Great Britain ; and ambivalent states - including key regional players in the Middle East , such as Turkey and Iran - whose actions fail to match their rhetoric . 
In such a divided context , the alliance of &quot; moderates &quot; created by US President Barack Obama to defeat the Islamic State - a group that includes Saudi Arabia , Qatar , and the United Arab Emirates - is weak at best . 
A multicultural coalition is probably a requirement of legitimate military action in the Middle East ; the dilemma is that unless Obama &apos;s regional coalition broadens considerably , his current allies &quot; enthusiasm for US military intervention is likely to diminish quickly . 
Or perhaps something like the &quot; bipolar hegemony &quot; of Great Britain and Russia after 1815 ( though other players like Austria , Prussia , and France mattered ) could be reconstituted , with the US and China substituting for Great Britain and Russia . 
This seems to be Henry Kissinger &apos;s ultimate dream - a dream that one can glimpse in his latest book , Germanically entitled World Order : Reflections on the Character of Nations and the Course of History . 
But can we depend on that dream &apos;s realization ? 
At a time when we are confronted by Russian expansionism and the extremism of messianic thugs , the lessons from the Congress of Vienna may seem distant and irrelevant . 
Yet one is obvious : States possess common interests that should trump national priorities . 
China , India , and Brazil are stakeholders in the world system , which means that they , too , need a minimum of order . 
But that implies that they also contribute to maintaining it . 
China &apos;s interests , for example , would be best served not by playing Russia against the US , but by choosing the party of order over the party of disorder . 
A gathering of the modern equivalents of Metternich , Castlereagh , Alexander I , and Talleyrand is also a dream : there are none . 
But , in confronting today &apos;s growing disorder and escalating violence , the leaders we have would do well to draw some inspiration from their forebears , who 200 years ago this week opened the way to nearly a century of peace .
