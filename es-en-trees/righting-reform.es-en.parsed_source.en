Righting Reform 
Most economists now agree that institutional quality holds the key to prosperity . 
Rich countries are places where investors feel secure in their property rights , the rule of law prevails , private incentives are aligned with social objectives , monetary and fiscal policies are solidly grounded , risks are mediated through social insurance , and citizens have recourse to civil liberties and political representation . 
Poor countries are where these arrangements are absent or ill-formed . 
Compare Russia and China . 
In Russia , an investor has in principle the full protection of a private property-rights regime enforced by an independent judiciary . 
In China , there is no such protection , because private property was not legally recognized until recently , and the court system is not independent . 
Yet during the mid-to late-1990 &apos;s , investors consistently gave China higher marks than Russia on the rule of law . 
That investors evidently felt better protected in China than they did in Russia is perhaps no surprise to anyone who has observed the evolution of Russia &apos;s legal system over the last decade . 
To be effective , a formal legal regime protecting investors &apos; rights requires a non-corrupt , independent judiciary with enforcement power . 
Setting up such a judiciary is difficult and takes time . 
So the efficacy of enhancing property rights by rewriting domestic legislation - changing the formal aspects of the institutional environment - is naturally uncertain . 
That seems to have been the trap in which Russia &apos;s transition was caught for some time . 
How did China evade this trap ? 
The largest boom in &quot; private &quot; investment in China took place ( at least until the mid-1990 &apos;s ) in Township and Village Enterprises ( TVEs ) . 
These were firms in which local governments typically held ownership . 
Private entrepreneurs were effectively partners with government . 
In a system where courts cannot be relied upon to protect property rights , letting the government hold residual rights in an enterprise may have been a second-best mechanism for avoiding expropriation . 
In such circumstances , the expectation of future profits can exert a stronger discipline on the public authority than fear of legal sanction . 
Private entrepreneurs felt secure not because the government was prevented from expropriating them , but because , sharing in the profits , it had no interest in expropriating them . 
This illustrates a broader point : there is no unique , non-context specific way of achieving desirable institutional outcomes . 
China could provide a semblance of effective protection of private property despite the absence of formal rights . 
The Russian experience strongly suggests that the obvious alternative of legal reform would not have been nearly as effective . 
We can multiply the examples . 
For instance , China provided market incentives through two-track economic reform rather than across-the-board liberalization , which is usually the standard advice . 
In agriculture and industry , price efficiency was achieved not by abolishing quotas and planned allocations , but by allowing producers to trade at market prices at the margin . 
In international trade , openness was achieved not by reducing import barriers , but by creating special economic zones with different rules than those applied to domestic production . 
The good news is that everything we know about economic development suggests that large-scale institutional transformation is hardly ever a prerequisite for jump-starting growth . 
True , sustained economic convergence eventually requires high-quality institutions . 
But the initial spurt in growth can be achieved with minimal changes in institutional arrangements . 
In other words , we need to distinguish between stimulating economic growth and sustaining it . 
Solid institutions are much more important for the latter than for the former . 
Ricardo Hausmann , Lant Pritchett , and I recently identified and examined more than 80 episodes of growth acceleration - in which a country increased its growth rate by 2 % or more for at least seven years - in the period since 1950 . 
The surprise was not only that there were so many cases , but that the vast majority seemed unrelated to conventional economic reforms , such as liberalization of trade and prices . 
To the extent that we can identify growth triggers , they seem to be related to relaxing constraints that held back private economic activity . 
Even in the better-known cases , institutional changes at the outset of growth acceleration were typically modest . 
China &apos;s gradual , experimental steps towards liberalization in the late 1970 &apos;s were similar to South Korea &apos;s experience in the early 1960 &apos;s . 
After taking power in 1961 , Park Chung Hee &apos;s military government moved in a trial-and-error fashion , without recourse to system-wide transformation , experimenting at first with various public investment projects . 
The hallmark reforms associated with the Korean miracle - devaluation and a hike in interest rates - came in 1964 and fell far short of full liberalization of currency and financial markets . 
Such instances indicate that an attitudinal change on the part of political leaders towards a more market-oriented , private-sector-friendly policy framework often plays as large a role in boosting economic growth as the scope of actual institutional reform . 
Such an attitudinal change appears to have had a particularly profound effect in one of the important growth miracles of the last quarter century - India since the early 1980 &apos;s . 
The trick for policymakers is to identify the binding constraint on economic growth at the relevant moment in time . 
In South Korea in 1961 , the major constraint was the gap between the social and private return on investment . 
In China circa 1978 , the constraint was the absence of market-oriented incentives . 
In the India of 1980 , it was government hostility to the private sector . 
In the Chile of 1983 , it was an overvalued exchange rate . 
Of course , it is easier to determine these constraints after the fact . 
We need to develop a framework for &quot; growth diagnostics &quot; capable of pinpointing where even a little reform can go a long way .
