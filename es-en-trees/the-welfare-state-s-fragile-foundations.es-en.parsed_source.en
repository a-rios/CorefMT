The Welfare State \ u0027s Fragile Foundations 
Tensions have existed between liberty and equality ever since modern democracy placed citizenship at the root of political legitimacy . 
In every democratic society , freedom for all has been at odds with equality for all , and vice versa . 
But no matter how frequently we proclaim that all &quot; are born free and equal in dignity and rights , &quot; this clash of principles has not diminished . 
Indeed , it has simply taken new forms , partly owing to economic and technical progress - and with it an increase in available wealth - and partly owing to efforts aimed at allaying it . 
The tension between civil , legal , and political equality and the reality of economic and social inequality was noted as far back as the French Revolution . 
Today , citizens inevitably use their civil , legal , and political rights to demand economic and social equality - or at least reduction of inequality . 
Equal rights , according to this logic - as socialist thought has emphasized - imply public policies aimed at narrowing inequalities in the actual living conditions of all citizens . 
Indeed , contemporary democracies are distinguished precisely by their ambition to combine respect for liberty and formal equality of rights with public policies that , as the Preamble of the 1946 French Constitution puts it , provide all citizens with &quot; adequate living conditions . &quot; 
Contemporary democracies base their legitimacy on ensuring both political and social rights . 
But intervention by modern democratic states goes beyond the boundaries of the post-1945 welfare state , which sought to protect individuals against risks linked to old age , family responsibilities , accidents , illness , and the labor market . 
Intervention has now been broadened to include education , culture , sport , and ethnicity , in the belief that only citizens who receive equal education and training , and have their historical and cultural specificity recognized , can enjoy genuine equality . 
As a result , the number of participants in educational institutions , as well as the absolute and relative costs of these institutions , is increasing . 
State-funded cultural programs strengthen &quot; welfare democracy &quot; even more , while the economic and symbolic importance of sporting events has led to state intervention that increasingly organizes athletic training along the lines of the public school system . 
Thanks to the welfare state , organized sports , which first appeared among the leisured upper classes , are now practiced by everyone . 
Moreover , communal rights have progressively been accorded to the various groups that compose a nation . 
Can there be real equality for citizens whose language , history , and collective identity are marginalized by the dominance of the majority &apos;s language , history , and collective identity ? 
Even in France , where universal republican principles theoretically contradict such policies , public action is being &apos; ethnicized &apos; under the mask of geographical or social criteria . 
Greater equality reinforces the ambition for still more equality . 
&quot; When inequality is the common law , the strongest inequalities are not conspicuous , &quot; Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in his classic Democracy in America , but &quot; when everything is more or less leveled , the slightest inequality hurts . &quot; 
Because no society can ensure complete equality , &quot; welfare democracy &quot; feeds dissatisfaction and frustration - and hence demands for more welfare democracy , not less . 
As a result , the welfare state becomes unavoidably particularizing , as it constantly adds and refines categories and groups entitled to formal recognition and resources . 
With the surge in unemployment in the 1970 &apos;s , for example , several new categories of beneficiaries were created and subsequently modified to adapt to funding limitations . 
All European countries then established a minimum income policy to help those whose benefits had run out . 
It is the source of the inflation in legislation in the European countries . 
So the birth and development of the welfare state reflects an inescapable fact : freedom and equality are both in tension and intimately linked , because both values are part and parcel of the democratic project . 
Democratic principles call for organizing society in such a way that both values can be realized to the greatest possible extent . 
But the path for particularistic action that does not undermine the liberty and equality of all citizens is narrow . 
This is a paradox intrinsic to democracy , and it is the duty of politicians to deal with the tensions to which it gives rise . 
Yet it is also the duty of citizens to preserve the formal , political meaning of citizenship as state intervention broadens to ensure the well being of all . 
This might restrict political freedom in the name of greater equality . 
Still more probably , it might confine politics to the day-to-day management of redistributing wealth among groups that coexist in the same society but do not necessarily share much else . 
Such an outcome , however , would quickly render all efforts to ensure material equality unsustainable . 
For without a common political identity on which to base social solidarity , redistribution of wealth by the welfare state loses its legitimacy .
