The Federal Reserve and the Currency Wars 
NEW YORK - The United States Federal Reserve &apos;s recent decision to launch a third round of &quot; quantitative easing &quot; has revived accusations by Brazil &apos;s finance minister , Guido Mantega , that the US has unleashed a &quot; currency war . &quot; 
In emerging-market countries that are already struggling with the impact of rapid currency appreciation on their competitiveness , expansionary measures announced in recent weeks by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have heightened the sense of alarm at the Fed &apos;s decision . 
My sense is that both sides are right . 
The Fed was right to adopt new expansionary monetary measures in the face of a weak US recovery . 
Furthermore , tying it to improvements in the labor market was a particularly important step - one that other central banks , especially the ECB , should follow . 
Of course , monetary expansion should be accompanied by a less contractionary fiscal stance in industrial countries . 
But the advanced economies &quot; room for fiscal maneuver is more limited than it was in 2007-2008 , and America &apos;s political gridlock has deepened , all but ruling out further stimulus through budgetary channels . 
Although the effectiveness of a new round of quantitative easing will be limited , as Mantega argues , the Fed had no choice but to act . 
But Mantega is also right . 
Given the role of the US dollar as the dominant global currency , the Fed &apos;s expansionary monetary policy generates significant externalities for the rest of the world - effects that the Fed is certainly not taking into account . 
The basic problem is that there are essential imperfections in an international monetary system that is based on the use of a national currency as the world &apos;s main reserve currency . 
This problem was highlighted as far back as the 1960 &quot; s by the Belgian economist Robert Triffin , and , more recently , by the late Italian economist Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa . 
&quot; The stability requirements of the system as a whole , &quot; Padoa-Schioppa argued , &quot; are inconsistent with the pursuit of economic and monetary policy forged solely on the basis of domestic rationales . &quot; 
In particular , expansionary monetary policies in the US ( indeed , in all advanced countries ) are generating high risks for emerging economies . 
Because interest rates must remain very low in developed countries at least for the next several years , there are now strong incentives to export capital to higher-yielding emerging economies . 
But such capital inflows threaten exchange-rate overvaluation , rising current-account deficits , and asset-price bubbles , all of which have in the past led to crises in these economies . 
In short , the medium-term benefits that emerging economies could receive from faster growth in the US are now being swamped by short-term risks generated by the &quot; capital tsunami , &quot; as Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has called it . 
The basic problem is the lack of a broader agenda that would make the Fed &apos;s position consistent with that of Mantega and other emerging-country officials . 
That agenda must include two issues of global monetary reform that remain unaddressed : coordinated global regulation of capital flows in the short term , and a long-term shift toward a new international monetary system based on a true global reserve currency ( possibly based on the International Monetary Fund &apos;s Special Drawing Rights ) . 
The US could benefit from such policies , as capital-account regulation would force investors to find opportunities at home , while a true global reserve currency would free the US from concerns - and harsh rebukes - about the implications of its monetary policy on the global economy . 
At the same time , emerging markets would gain the full benefits of expansionary monetary policy in the US , to the extent that it boosts demand for their exports . 
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde has called for coordinated action to sustain the global recovery . 
Moreover , in October , the IMF is set to release official &quot; rules of the road &quot; for the use of capital-account regulations . 
The IMF / World Bank meetings in Tokyo on October 12-13 thus might be the ideal opportunity to begin broadening the international monetary agenda - by giving the green light to coordinated regulation of cross-border capital flows , and launching a discussion about the future of the international monetary system .
