The Moral Limits of Markets 
TOKYO - Today , there are very few things that money can &apos;t buy . 
If you are sentenced to a jail term in Santa Barbara , California , and don &apos;t like the standard accommodations , you can buy a prison-cell upgrade for about $ 90 per night . 
If you want to help to prevent the tragic fact that , each year , thousands of babies are born to drug-addicted mothers , you can contribute to a charity that uses a market mechanism to ameliorate the problem : a $ 300 cash grant to any drug-addicted woman willing to be sterilized . 
Or , if you want to attend a US Congressional hearing , but don &apos;t want to wait for hours in line , you can enlist the services of a line-standing company . 
The company hires homeless people and others in need of work to wait in line - overnight if necessary . 
Just before the hearing begins , the paying customer can take his or her line-stander &apos;s place in the queue , and claim a front-row seat in the hearing room . 
Is there anything wrong with buying and selling these things ? 
Some would say no ; people should be free to spend their money to buy whatever someone else is willing to sell . 
Others believe that there are some things that money should not be able to buy . 
But why ? 
What exactly is wrong with selling prison-cell upgrades to those who can afford them , or offering cash for sterilization , or hiring line-standers ? 
To answer questions such as these , we need to pose a bigger question : What role should money and markets play in a good society ? 
Asking this question , and debating it politically , is more important than ever . 
The last three decades have witnessed a quiet revolution , as markets and market-oriented thinking have reached into spheres of life previously governed by non-market values : family life and personal relations ; health and education ; environmental protection and criminal justice ; national security and civic life . 
Almost without realizing it , we have drifted from having market economies to becoming market societies . 
The difference is this : A market economy is a tool - a valuable and effective tool - for organizing productive activity . 
A market society , by contrast , is a place where almost everything is up for sale . 
It is a way of life in which market values seep into social relations and govern every domain . 
We should be worried about this trend for two reasons . 
First , as money looms larger in our societies , affluence - and its absence - matters more . 
If the main advantages of affluence were the ability to afford yachts and fancy vacations , inequality would matter less than it does today . 
But , as money comes to govern access to education , health care , political influence , and safe neighborhoods , life becomes harder for those of modest means . 
The marketization of everything sharpens the sting of inequality . 
A second reason to resist putting a price tag on all human activities is that doing so can be corrupting . 
Prostitution is a classic example . 
Some object to it on the grounds that it typically exploits the poor , for whom the choice to sell their bodies may not be truly voluntary . 
But others object on the grounds that reducing sex to a commodity is inherently degrading and objectifying . 
The idea that market relations can corrupt higher goods is not restricted to matters of sex and the body . 
It also applies to civic goods and practices . 
Consider voting . 
We don &apos;t allow a free market in votes , even though such a market would arguably be &quot; efficient , &quot; in the economist &apos;s sense of the term . 
Many people don &apos;t use their votes , so why let them go to waste ? 
Why not let those who don &apos;t much care about an election &apos;s outcome sell their vote to someone who does ? 
Both parties to the transaction would be better off . 
The best argument against a market in votes is that the vote is not a piece of private property ; rather , it is a public responsibility . 
To treat a vote as an instrument of profit would be to degrade it , to corrupt its meaning as an expression of civic duty . 
But , if a market in votes is objectionable because it corrupts democracy , what about systems of campaign finance ( including the one currently in place in the United States ) that give wealthy donors a disproportionate voice in elections ? 
The reason to reject a market in votes - preserving the integrity of democracy - may be a reason to limit financial contributions to political candidates as well . 
Of course , we often disagree about what counts as &quot; corrupting &quot; or &quot; degrading . &quot; 
To decide whether prostitution is degrading , we have to decide how human sexuality is properly valued . 
To decide whether selling prison-cell upgrades corrupts the meaning of criminal justice , we have to decide what purpose criminal punishment should serve . 
To decide whether we should allow the buying and selling of human organs for transplantation , or hire mercenaries to fight our wars , we have to think through hard questions about human dignity and civic responsibility . 
These are controversial questions , and we often try to avoid addressing them in public discourse . 
But that is a mistake . 
Our reluctance to engage morally contested questions in politics has left us ill-equipped to deliberate about one of the most important issues of our time : Where do markets serve the public good , and where do they not belong ?
