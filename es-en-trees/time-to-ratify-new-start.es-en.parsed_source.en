Time to Ratify New START 
WARSAW - As a long-time observer of American politics , I know that United States senators will decide whether to ratify New START , the arms control treaty with Russia negotiated this year , on the basis of a thorough evaluation of their country &apos;s national interests . 
As the democratically elected representatives of the American people , they alone can determine what those interests are . 
The US remains the world &apos;s most powerful state , however , and the senators &quot; decision will inevitably have an impact beyond their country &apos;s borders . 
It will be particularly significant for Poland , a staunch ally of the US in NATO . 
So it is important to make clear : my government supports the ratification of New START , because we believe it will bolster our country &apos;s security , and that of Europe as a whole . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s nuclear-disarmament efforts have gained wide support in Poland . 
The country &apos;s first democratic prime minister , along with two former presidents , including Lech Wałęsa , the legendary leader of Solidarity , published a joint article last year in support of Obama &apos;s bold disarmament agenda . 
For almost a year now , since the expiration of the original START treaty in December 2009 , no US inspectors have been on the ground in Russia to verify the state of its nuclear arsenal . 
The START verification provisions provide crucial information that is essential for the force-planning process . 
Without a treaty in place , holes will soon appear in the nuclear umbrella that the US provides to Poland and other allies under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty , the collective security guarantee for NATO members . 
Moreover , New START is a necessary stepping-stone to future negotiations with Russia about reductions in tactical nuclear arsenals , and a prerequisite for the successful revival of the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE ) . 
While we in Poland do not perceive an immediate military threat from Russia , most of the world &apos;s active tactical or sub-strategic nuclear weapons today seem to be deployed just east of Poland &apos;s borders , in speculative preparation for conflict in Europe . 
The cataclysmic potential of such a conflict makes it essential to limit and eventually eliminate this leftover from the Cold War . 
This was the reasoning behind the Polish-Norwegian initiative aimed at addressing the issue of tactical nuclear weapons within the larger arms-control framework that was launched in this past April . 
In effect , New START is the sine qua nonfor effective US leadership on the arms-control and non-proliferation issues that matter to Europe - from reviving the CFE treaty to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . 
More broadly , New START will cement the new , more positive tone in relations between Russia and the West . 
Indeed , we in Poland have adopted our own way of reconciliation with Russia , one based on dialogue and reciprocity . 
As a result , Polish-Russian relations have improved significantly over the last three years - no easy feat , given the burden of our shared history . 
Though difficulties still lie ahead , Poland is determined to build a relationship with Russia based on mutual respect . 
Also in the cards is more substantive cooperation between NATO and Russia in the field of missile defense , an issue discussed at this year &apos;s NATO-Russia Summit in Lisbon , and that has the potential to transform NATO-Russia relations . 
In order for that to happen , Russia &apos;s leaders must come to view missile defense as an opportunity to work together to address common threats , rather than a threat in itself . 
Ratification of New START will increase mutual trust and show that the West and Russia , despite our disagreements , can work together on issues critical to our common security . 
Any delay to the treaty , however , will embolden those in Moscow who would rather have the West as an enemy than as a partner - and who thus would like to see the tenuous progress made in recent months to be undone . 
Meanwhile , the Obama administration continues to pursue its plans for European missile defense . 
More than a year ago , Poland decided to take part in the new Phased Adaptive Approach , which will primarily protect America &apos;s European allies . 
The Polish government has agreed to host elements of the modified European Missile Defense System on Polish territory in the second half of the decade . 
I hope that US senators take into account the view from Warsaw in making their decisions . 
New START is in the interest of disarmament and of Europe . 
Poland supports ratification of this vitally important treaty .
