The ECB &apos;s New Macroeconomic Realism 
NEW YORK - The European Central Bank has finally launched a policy of quantitative easing ( QE ) . 
The key question at this stage is whether Germany will give the ECB the freedom of maneuver needed to carry out this monetary expansion with sufficient boldness . 
Though QE cannot produce long-term growth , it can do much to end the ongoing recession that has gripped the eurozone since 2008 . 
The record-high stock-market levels in Europe this week , in anticipation of QE , not only indicate growing confidence , but are also a direct channel by which monetary easing can boost both investment and consumption . 
But some observers , such as Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman and former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers , continue to doubt whether QE can really be effective . 
As Krugman recently put it , a &quot; deflationary vortex &quot; is dragging down much of the world economy , with falling prices causing an inescapable downward spiral in demand . 
The World Bank and International Monetary Fund seem to agree , as both recently lowered their growth forecasts a few notches . 
Pessimists argue that the world economy suffers from an insurmountable shortage of aggregate demand , leading to a new &quot; secular stagnation . &quot; 
Monetary policy is seen to be relatively ineffective , owing to the notorious zero lower bound ( ZLB ) on nominal interest rates . 
With policy interest rates near zero , the argument goes , central banks are more or less helpless to escape the deflationary vortex , and economies become stuck in the infamous liquidity trap . 
In this scenario , the demand insufficiency feeds on itself , pushing down prices , raising real ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rates , and lowering demand further . 
This perspective has been prominent among Keynesian economists in the United States and the United Kingdom since 2008 . 
Krugman argues that Japan was only the first of the major economies to succumb to chronic deflation , back in the 1990s , and has now been followed by the European Union , China , and most recently Switzerland , with its soaring franc and falling prices . 
The US , in this view , remains near the vortex as well , prompting the Keynesians &quot; repeated calls for more fiscal stimulus , which , unlike monetary policy , is seen by the pessimists to be especially efficacious at the ZLB . 
In my view , the pessimists have exaggerated the risks of deflation , which is why their recent forecasts have missed the mark . 
Most notably , they failed to predict the rebound in both the US and the UK , with growth rising and unemployment falling even as deficits were cut . 
Without a proper diagnosis of the 2008 crisis , an effective cure cannot be prescribed . 
The pessimists believe that there has been a large decline in the will to invest , something like the loss of &quot; animal spirits &quot; described by Keynes . 
Even with very low interest rates , according to this view , investment demand will remain low , and therefore aggregate demand will remain insufficient . 
Deflation will make matters worse , leaving only large fiscal deficits able to close the demand gap . 
But the causes of 2008 &quot; s deep downturn were more specific , and the solutions must be more targeted . 
A large housing bubble preceded the 2008 crisis in the hardest-hit countries ( the US , the UK , Ireland , Spain , Portugal , and Italy ) . 
As Friedrich Hayek warned back in the 1930s , the consequences of such a process of misplaced investment take time to resolve , owing to the subsequent oversupply of specific capital ( in this case , of the housing stock ) . 
Yet far more devastating than the housing bubble was the financial panic that gripped capital markets worldwide after the collapse of Lehman Brothers . 
The decision by the US Federal Reserve and the US Treasury to teach the markets a lesson by allowing Lehman to fail was a disastrously bad call . 
The panic was sharp and severe , requiring central banks to play their fundamental role as lenders of last resort . 
As poorly as the Fed performed in the years preceding the Lehman Brothers &quot; collapse , it performed splendidly well afterward , by flooding the markets with liquidity to break the panic . 
So , too , did the Bank of England , though it was a bit slower to react . 
The Bank of Japan and the ECB were , characteristically , the slowest to react , keeping their policy rates higher for longer , and not undertaking QE and other extraordinary liquidity measures until late in the day . 
Indeed , it required new leaders in both institutions - Haruhiko Kuroda at the BOJ and Mario Draghi at the ECB - finally to set monetary policy right . 
The good news is that , even near the ZLB , monetary policy works . 
QE raises equity prices ; lowers long-term interest rates ; causes currencies to depreciate ; and eases credit crunches , even when interest rates are near zero . 
The ECB and the BOJ did not suffer from a lack of reflationary tools ; they suffered from a lack of suitable action . 
The efficacy of monetary policy is good news , because fiscal stimulus is a weak instrument for short-term demand management . 
Ironically , in an influential 1998 paper , Krugman explained why . 
He argued at that time , and rightly in my view , that short-term tax reductions and transfers would be partly saved , not spent , and that public debt would multiply and create a long-term shadow over the fiscal balance and the economy . 
Even if interest rates are currently low , he noted , they will rise , thereby increasing the debt-service burden on the newly accumulated debt . 
With all major central banks pursuing expansionary monetary policies , oil prices falling sharply , and the ongoing revolution in information technology spurring investment opportunities , the prospects for economic growth in 2015 and beyond are better than they look to the pessimists . 
There are rising profits , reasonable investment prospects for businesses , a large backlog on infrastructure spending almost everywhere in Europe and the US , and the opportunity to finance capital-goods exports to low-income regions , such as Sub-Saharan Africa , and to meet the worldwide need for investment in a new , low-carbon energy system . 
If there is a shortfall of private investment , the problem is not really a lack of good projects ; it is the lack of policy clarity and complementary long-term public investment . 
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker &apos;s plan to finance long-term investments in Europe by leveraging relatively small amounts of public funds to unlock large flows of private capital is therefore an important step in the right direction . 
Obviously , we should not underestimate the capacity of policymakers to make a bad situation worse ( for example , by pressing Greek debt service beyond the limits of social tolerance ) . 
But we should recognize that the main threats to growth this year , such as the unresolved Greek debt crisis , the Russia-Ukraine conflict , and turmoil in the Middle East , are more geopolitical than macroeconomic in nature . 
In 2015 , wise diplomacy and wise monetary policy can create a path to prosperity . 
Broad recovery is within reach if we manage both ingredients well .
