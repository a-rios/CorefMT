Endgame for Evo ? 
LA PAZ - The populist government of Bolivian President Evo Morales seems to be heading for political failure . 
Faced with 11 % annual price growth and mounting complaints from the country &apos;s worst-affected sectors , Morales promises change , but delays decisions , leaving in place the policies that are stoking the problem . 
Of course , economic common sense sometimes prevails , but it is usually short-lived . 
At the end of 2010 , for example , the Morales government decided to eliminate fuel subsidies in order to reduce the fiscal drain of importing market-rate energy and selling it at prices that have not changed in ten years . 
But the decision was reversed within a week , because the groups that brought Morales to power took to the streets in protest . 
Morales then promised to &quot; govern by obeying . &quot; 
Opinion polls have registered a sharp fall in Morales &apos;s popularity , with social protest of the type he once engineered now raised against him . 
A long strike by public transport workers was followed by another , just as long , staged by the Central Obrera ( Bolivia &apos;s trade union federation ) and state employees . 
The transport workers wanted a pay increase , following a multi-year wage freeze , while other workers want higher salaries to compensate for inflation , which is higher in Bolivia than the Latin American average , while economic growth is lower . 
Morales has yielded to the protests by making concessions and short-term promises , which will only fuel further inflation . 
Moreover , the lack of effective results from the state &apos;s administration of companies is endangering the popular backing of the nationalizations that brought Morales to power . 
For example , Morales tried to appease the Central Obrera unions by offering to nationalize three important mines . 
But the workers , having seen what Morales-style management is like , refused , preferring to remain in the private sector . 
The government , however , seems unwilling to recognize public dissatisfaction with its ideologically driven policies or the failure of forced industrialization . 
None of the new state-owned factories ( paper , cardboard , milk , urea , cement , textiles , and citric products ) created in recent years is fully up and running , and nationalized companies ( particularly the country &apos;s oil refineries ) have experienced declines in output and efficiency . 
Convinced that he can increase production and employment , Morales has forced the central bank to give credit on favorable terms to state-owned companies . 
In other words , his government remains determined to increase the state &apos;s hold over the economy . 
Meanwhile , drug trafficking grows and diversifies , despite more police . 
Efforts to eradicate coca plantations have achieved the bare minimum , and increasingly frequent seizures of cocaine and coca paste originating in Peru indicate that trafficking activities are relocating to Bolivia , thus bringing more illicit money and more organized - and violent - criminal groups . 
Bolivia &apos;s neighbors , Brazil and Chile in particular , have expressed growing concern about this trend . 
While they have gained new verbal commitments from Morales to contain the narcotics trade , the government &apos;s ineffectiveness was evident when a Bolivian police general was arrested in Chile while transporting a huge shipment of cocaine to the United States . 
The official , convicted in the US for drug trafficking , was the head of the intelligence agency on whose efficiency the fight against drug trafficking depends . 
In the face of his growing problems , Morales has resorted to two tactics that successfully diverted public opinion in the past : conflict with Chile over landlocked Bolivia &apos;s claims to Chilean territory that would give it an outlet to the sea , and a new electoral campaign , this time for judges . 
But the claim against Chile does not seem to have the same attraction that it had in the past , and the election of judges to the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Tribunal backfired . 
Indeed , Morales endured a resounding defeat , with 60 % of voters rejecting the government &apos;s initiative with ballots that were either nullified or blank . 
A movement of indigenous people from Bolivia &apos;s lowlands played a crucial role , staging a march on La Paz to demand respect for the Indigenous Territory and National Park &quot; Isiboro-Sécure &quot; ( TIPNIS ) . 
Their efforts forced Evo to ban road construction through the park , part of a project financed by Brazil and backed by that country &apos;s former president , Luiz Ignácio Lula da Silva . 
Evo &apos;s political prospects look grim . 
Government spending is using up a large share of the country &apos;s export revenues . 
A fiscal deficit has returned . 
Inflation - mainly from higher food prices - is generating discontent , and legal insecurity is discouraging the investment that could increase supply . 
Organized groups ( unions , neighborhoods , and communities ) are increasingly impatient , and management of state institutions is becoming increasingly incompetent . 
Changing direction and adjusting policies to the people &apos;s demands should be easy in a regime that concentrates power in the president . 
A caudillo can make key decisions alone , because popular support is personalized : only he is indispensable . 
But Morales is persisting in his policies , despite the absence of positive results . 
As this inclination continues to alienate his electoral base , the formulas that brought him to power may ultimately lead to his downfall .
