America &apos;s Perilous Pivot 
MADRID - The Pacific or the Middle East ? 
For the United States , that is now the primary strategic question . 
The violence in Gaza , coming as President Barack Obama was meeting Asia &apos;s leaders in Phnom Penh , perfectly encapsulates America &apos;s dilemma . 
Instead of being able to focus on US foreign policy &apos;s &quot; pivot &quot; to Asia , Obama was forced to spend many hours in conversation with the leaders of Egypt and Israel , and to dispatch Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from Asia , in order to facilitate a cease-fire in Gaza . 
Of the two geopolitical focal points demanding America &apos;s attention , one represents the future and the other the past . 
Whereas Asia played an important role in a US presidential election campaign that was marked by often-heated references to China &apos;s rise , the Middle East has kept the US bogged down for decades . 
In addition to the eternal Israel-Palestine conflict , Iraq &apos;s instability , the Arab Spring , Syria &apos;s civil war , and the ongoing nuclear standoff with Iran all demand America &apos;s attention . 
If the Iran crisis were to boil over , the pivot to Asia would no longer be America &apos;s main foreign-policy priority . 
But if the dispute with Iran is resolved diplomatically , the Middle East might , perhaps , be relegated to a position of lesser importance , as Obama clearly desires . 
The question , therefore , is whether the US will find itself drawn into another war in a region on which it depends less and less for energy . 
Indeed , the revolution in non-conventional hydrocarbons , particularly shale gas and oil , which the International Energy Agency recently predicted would make the US the world &apos;s largest oil producer by 2020 , and the top energy producer overall by 2030 , will have enormous global repercussions . 
For the US , energy self-sufficiency is the perfect excuse for a phased withdrawal from the Middle East ; freed from energy dependency , America should be able to concentrate on the Pacific . 
Although maintaining stable global energy prices and its alliance with Israel means that the US cannot cut itself off completely from the Middle East &apos;s troubles , the shift in focus to Asia began early in Obama &apos;s first administration , with Clinton announcing America &apos;s strategic reorientation even before US troops began withdrawing from Iraq . 
Following his re-election , Obama &apos;s first foreign visit was to Myanmar , Thailand , and Cambodia - a choice that cannot have pleased China , as all three are ASEAN members , while Myanmar was , until it began its democratic transition , a close Chinese ally . 
Asia is , of course , experiencing rapid economic growth , but managing the region &apos;s strong nationalist tensions calls for the creation of regional security structures , together with closer economic integration . 
Complicating matters even more is what US scholar Kenneth Lieberthal and Wang Jisi , the dean of international studies at Peking University , called in a recent paper for the Brookings Institution &quot; strategic distrust . &quot; 
Cultivating strategic trust between the twenty-first century &apos;s leading powers will be fundamental to the international system &apos;s harmonious functioning . 
But how can this be achieved ? 
After the January 2013 Israeli elections , Iran will again move to the top of Obama &apos;s foreign-policy agenda . 
Military intervention in Iran - which itself will be holding a presidential election in June - would incite not only regional , but global , instability . 
The Arab world , Russia , and China would be forced to take sides , straining global relations between the different poles of power and raising tensions in the Pacific . 
Beyond Iran , the volatile situation throughout the Middle East urgently demands solutions . 
The latest eruption of violent conflict between Hamas and Israel underscores the importance of reviving the peace process . 
Syria &apos;s civil war , in which a growing number of regional players have become involved , is beginning to look increasingly like a trial run for all-out war between Sunni Muslims ( Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf States , Turkey , and Egypt ) and Shia Muslims ( Iran and Hezbollah ) for regional dominance . 
Iran &apos;s leaders appear to believe that the US , having incurred extremely high economic and human costs from more than a decade of war , would rather avoid another military intervention . 
US public opinion seems to confirm this . 
A recent survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs indicated that 67 % of Americans believe that the Iraq war was not worthwhile . 
Moreover , 69 % do not believe that the US is safer from terrorism since the war in Afghanistan , and 71 % say that the experience in Iraq shows that the US should take greater care in how it uses force . 
But , if Americans seem unlikely to be willing to invest billions of dollars in another dead-end foreign adventure , Iran &apos;s leaders , for their part , are increasingly hemmed in by international sanctions , which are beginning to wreak havoc on the country &apos;s economy . 
Both sides may believe that their best option - at least for now - is to negotiate . 
Peaceful resolution of the Iranian question would help the US to complete its shift toward Asia . 
China may not wish for that outcome , but its own vital interest in the security of Middle East energy supplies should compel it to cooperate . 
After all , another Middle East conflict would poison and distort relations in the region for decades , which would be the worst of all possible consequences - for the US and China alike .
