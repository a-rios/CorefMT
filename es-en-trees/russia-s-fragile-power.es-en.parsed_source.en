Russia &apos;s Fragile Power 
Russia sent an impressive delegation to the World Economic Forum at Davos this year . 
After strong representation under Boris Yeltsin , the level of Russia &apos;s participants had slipped since Vladimir Putin became president . 
This year , however , the Russians sent their &quot; A &quot; team , and a well-attended session focused on &quot; Russia &apos;s More Muscular Foreign Policy . &quot; 
With higher energy prices , many Russian officials are enjoying their renewed power . 
I was asked to comment on United States-Russian relations at a dinner with top officials from the government and Gazprom , the giant energy company . 
I said that America and Europe had too many illusions about democracy in Russia in the 1990 &quot; s , and were now going through a stage of disillusionment . 
There is concern about Russia &apos;s future , how it will use its newfound power , and how the West should respond . 
One view is that Russian politics is like a pendulum . 
It had swung too far in the direction of chaos under Yeltsin , and has now swung too far in the direction of order and state control under Putin . 
It has not swung back to Stalinism ; 
Observers debate whether it will eventually reach a new equilibrium . 
The optimistic view is that property rights are becoming more deeply anchored than they were in the past , and that Russia &apos;s future will depend on how fast a middle class with a stake in law-based government can be created . 
Sometimes pendulums continue to oscillate wildly unless there is some friction to slow them down , and sometimes they get stuck . 
Pessimistic observers foresee a continual decline of freedom rather than a liberal equilibrium . 
Faced with this uncertainty about the future of liberal democracy in Russia , how should western countries respond ? 
This question is particularly difficult for the Bush administration , which is torn between the president &apos;s early endorsement of Putin and his pro-democracy agenda . 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice declared in 2005 that &quot; the fundamental character of regimes matters more today than the international distribution of power , &quot; and Senator John McCain , a US presidential candidate , has urged removing Russia from the Group of Eight advanced countries . 
Yet , in addition to its democracy agenda , the West has a realist agenda based on very tangible interests . 
The West needs Russian cooperation in dealing with issues like nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea , the control of nuclear materials and weapons , combating the current wave of radical Islamist terrorism , and energy production and security . 
Moreover , Russia possesses talented people , technology , and resources that can help to meet new challenges like climate change or the spread of pandemic diseases . 
There may not be as much conflict between these two agendas as first appears . 
If the West were to turn its back on Russia , such isolation would reinforce the xenophobic and statist tendencies present in Russian political culture and make the liberal cause more difficult . 
A better approach would be to look to the long run , use the soft power of attraction , expand exchanges and contacts with Russia &apos;s new generation , support its participation in the World Trade Organization and other market-oriented institutions , and address deficiencies with specific criticisms rather than general harangues or isolation . 
In any case , the sources of political change in Russia will remain largely rooted in Russia , and Western influence will inevitably be limited . 
But advocating engagement over isolation should not prevent friendly criticism , and in Davos I offered four reasons why Russia will not remain a major power in 2020 unless it changes its current behavior and policies . 
First , Russia is failing to diversify its economy rapidly enough . 
Oil is a mixed blessing . 
Riding on record-high energy prices and raw material exports , in January 2007 Russia became the world &apos;s tenth-largest economy . 
Russian industrial exports primarily consist of armaments , with advanced aircraft accounting for more than half of sales . 
That leaves Russia vulnerable . 
A related problem is that Russia lacks a rule of law that protects and encourages entrepreneurs . 
These are precisely the people needed to help foster a vibrant middle class - the bedrock of a stable democratic market economy . 
Instead , corruption is rampant . 
Moreover , Russia &apos;s demographic crisis continues , sustained by poor public health and inadequate investment in a social safety net . 
Most demographers expect Russia &apos;s population to shrink significantly over the coming decades . 
Adult male mortality is much higher than in the rest of Europe , and it has not been improving . 
Finally , while one can understand a former superpower &apos;s temptation to seize its opportunity to return to a muscular foreign policy , Russia &apos;s bullying in the energy area is destroying trust and undercutting Russia &apos;s soft power in other countries . 
Both Russia &apos;s neighbors and Western Europe have become more wary of depending upon Russia . 
Most Russian participants at the Davos dinner seemed to ignore these criticisms , but it was interesting to hear one important official admit that reform might progress faster if oil prices dropped somewhat , and another accept the point that criticism should be welcomed as long as it is offered in a friendly spirit . 
The mere fact that high-level Russians reappeared in Davos to defend themselves may be a small but healthy sign .
