A Global Perfect Storm 
NEW YORK - Dark , lowering financial and economic clouds are , it seems , rolling in from every direction : the eurozone , the United States , China , and elsewhere . 
Indeed , the global economy in 2013 could be a very difficult environment in which to find shelter . 
For starters , the eurozone crisis is worsening , as the euro remains too strong , front-loaded fiscal austerity deepens recession in many member countries , and a credit crunch in the periphery and high oil prices undermine prospects of recovery . 
The eurozone banking system is becoming balkanized , as cross-border and interbank credit lines are cut off , and capital flight could turn into a full run on periphery banks if , as is likely , Greece stages a disorderly euro exit in the next few months . 
Moreover , fiscal and sovereign-debt strains are becoming worse as interest-rate spreads for Spain and Italy have returned to their unsustainable peak levels . 
Indeed , the eurozone may require not just an international bailout of banks ( as recently in Spain ) , but also a full sovereign bailout at a time when eurozone and international firewalls are insufficient to the task of backstopping both Spain and Italy . 
As a result , disorderly breakup of the eurozone remains possible . 
Farther to the west , US economic performance is weakening , with first-quarter growth a miserly 1.9 % - well below potential . 
And job creation faltered in April and May , so the US may reach stall speed by year end . 
Worse , the risk of a double-dip recession next year is rising : even if what looks like a looming US fiscal cliff turns out to be only a smaller source of drag , the likely increase in some taxes and reduction of some transfer payments will reduce growth in disposable income and consumption . 
Moreover , political gridlock over fiscal adjustment is likely to persist , regardless of whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney wins November &apos;s presidential election . 
Thus , new fights on the debt ceiling , risks of a government shutdown , and rating downgrades could further depress consumer and business confidence , reducing spending and accelerating a flight to safety that would exacerbate the fall in stock markets . 
In the east , China , its growth model unsustainable , could be underwater by 2013 , as its investment bust continues and reforms intended to boost consumption are too little too late . 
A new Chinese leadership must accelerate structural reforms to reduce national savings and increase consumption &apos;s share of GDP ; but divisions within the leadership about the pace of reform , together with the likelihood of a bumpy political transition , suggest that reform will occur at a pace that simply is not fast enough . 
The economic slowdown in the US , the eurozone , and China already implies a massive drag on growth in other emerging markets , owing to their trade and financial links with the US and the European Union ( that is , no &quot; decoupling &quot; has occurred ) . 
At the same time , the lack of structural reforms in emerging markets , together with their move towards greater state capitalism , is hampering growth and will reduce their resiliency . 
Finally , long-simmering tensions in the Middle East between Israel and the US on one side and Iran on the other on the issue of nuclear proliferation could reach a boil by 2013 . 
The current negotiations are likely to fail , and even tightened sanctions may not stop Iran from trying to build nuclear weapons . 
With the US and Israel unwilling to accept containment of a nuclear Iran by deterrence , a military confrontation in 2013 would lead to a massive oil price spike and global recession . 
These risks are already exacerbating the economic slowdown : equity markets are falling everywhere , leading to negative wealth effects on consumption and capital spending . 
Borrowing costs are rising for highly indebted sovereigns , credit rationing is undermining small and medium-size companies , and falling commodity prices are reducing exporting countries &quot; income . 
Increasing risk aversion is leading economic agents to adopt a wait-and-see stance that makes the slowdown partly self-fulfilling . 
Compared to 2008-2009 , when policymakers had ample space to act , monetary and fiscal authorities are running out of policy bullets ( or , more cynically , policy rabbits to pull out of their hats ) . 
Monetary policy is constrained by the proximity to zero interest rates and repeated rounds of quantitative easing . 
Indeed , economies and markets no longer face liquidity problems , but rather credit and insolvency crises . 
Meanwhile , unsustainable budget deficits and public debt in most advanced economies have severely limited the scope for further fiscal stimulus . 
Using exchange rates to boost net exports is a zero-sum game at a time when private and public deleveraging is suppressing domestic demand in countries that are running current-account deficits and structural issues are having the same effect in surplus countries . 
After all , a weaker currency and better trade balance in some countries necessarily implies a stronger currency and a weaker trade balance in others . 
Meanwhile , the ability to backstop , ring-fence , and bail out banks and other financial institutions is constrained by politics and near-insolvent sovereigns &quot; inability to absorb additional losses from their banking systems . 
As a result , sovereign risk is now becoming banking risk . 
Indeed , sovereigns are dumping a larger fraction of their public debt onto banks &quot; balance sheet , especially in the eurozone . 
To prevent a disorderly outcome in the eurozone , today &apos;s fiscal austerity should be much more gradual , a growth compact should complement the EU &apos;s new fiscal compact , and a fiscal union with debt mutualization ( Eurobonds ) should be implemented . 
In addition , a full banking union , starting with eurozone-wide deposit insurance , should be initiated , and moves toward greater political integration must be considered , even as Greece leaves the eurozone . 
Unfortunately , Germany resists all of these key policy measures , as it is fixated on the credit risk to which its taxpayers would be exposed with greater economic , fiscal , and banking integration . 
As a result , the probability of a eurozone disaster is rising . 
And , while the cloud over the eurozone may be the largest to burst , it is not the only one threatening the global economy . 
Batten down the hatches .
