Inequality and the Internet 
BERKELEY - The conclusion that America has become vastly more unequal over the past 35 years is beyond doubt . 
Since 1979 , the pattern has been clear : The richer you were , the far richer you have become . 
And if you were poor , you probably stayed poor . 
But the same period has also been an era of rapid technological change . 
The United States is undergoing a third industrial revolution , an information-age upheaval that could be as momentous as its predecessors , which transformed society through the introduction of steam , iron , cotton , and machinery , and then internal combustion , electricity , and steel . 
Today , nearly every resident of a developed country - and soon most of the rest of the world - can easily afford a smartphone , thereby gaining inexpensive access to a universe of human knowledge and entertainment that , until a generation ago , was far beyond the reach of all but the rich . 
Is it possible that conventional measures of inequality and income vastly underestimate just how good we have it ? 
According to conventional economics , the answer , at first glance , seems to be no . 
The calculations of economic growth that reveal growing inequality already take into account spending on telecommunications , information processing , and audiovisual entertainment . 
Unless the benefits from information-age goods and services greatly outstrip what we spend on them , the wellbeing they provide will have already been accounted for . 
But is that &quot; unless &quot; really so far-fetched ? 
When we invest in our wellbeing , we not only spend money to purchase goods and services ; we allocate a portion of our free time to use them properly . 
A movie ticket will not do you much good if you leave before the curtain rises . 
Time , like money , is a scarce resource ; and , because goods and services related to information require our attention , they are time-intensive . 
Ever since Homer chanted his Iliad around the campfire after dark , we have been willing to pay dearly for stories , entertainment , and information . 
The technology of the information age has given us the possibility to invest our time in ways that once only the most powerful could afford . 
If , in the seventeenth century , you wanted to watch Macbeth in your house , you had to be named James Stuart , have William Shakespeare and his acting company on retainer , and have a full-sized theater in your royal palace . 
We spend , on average , two hours a day with our audio-video devices . 
Assume for a minute that the opportunities provided by the rollout of broadband Internet has at least doubled the utility - the pleasure - that we get during that time . 
That is the equivalent of receiving an extra two hours of free time every day , on top of the ten hours on average that we spend awake and not at work . 
Put in economic terms , that is an extra rise of 0.6 % per year in standards of living since 1990 , a far larger increase than the 0.2 % per year that reliance on conventional measures would lead us to conclude . 
The question then becomes whether our smartphones , Kindles , tablets , and computers actually do provide us that extra utility . 
Do we value what we get from Netflix , YouTube , Facebook , and the Internet &apos;s online library of humanity far more than what we previously learned , listened to , watched , or gossiped about through traditional means ? 
Is watching television on demand more rewarding than visiting a movie theater ? 
Is your Twitter stream more illuminating than a trip to a nearby library ? 
Are Facebook friends more valuable than , well , friends ? 
Whatever the answer to those questions , there is an even bigger wrinkle . 
We do not consume goods and services in a vacuum . 
Part of the pleasure we receive from them derives from a feeling that our status is rising relative to that of our peers . 
The information age has not only provided us with new entertainment options ; it has opened new vistas into our neighbors &quot; lifestyles - and what we have noticed is that some of them are getting much , much richer . 
If I were to hazard a guess , I would say that , as a society , the benefits we have received from information-age technology have been neutralized by the envy and spite that results from living in a world that is ever more unequal .
