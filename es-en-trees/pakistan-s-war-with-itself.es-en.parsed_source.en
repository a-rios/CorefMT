Pakistan &apos;s War with Itself 
LAHORE - Pakistan is now a nation caught between its army and the Taliban , fighting a war not of its own making . Its population lives in fear of bombings and suicide attacks - the next one could be at the local mosque , an internet caf√© , or a roadside restaurant . Most Pakistanis are now resigned to full-scale army action being extended across the country . 
They were not evacuated . 
They were left to walk for miles and days to safety . 
The United States and the Pakistani army , meanwhile , evidently believe that their sole responsibility is to keep the Taliban at bay . 
Indeed , only when the mass of internally displaced people swelled to 1.5 million - the worst humanitarian disaster since the Rwanda genocide - did foreign countries , including the US , decided to provide emergency aid . 
If the government of Pakistan and its friends do not accept that this human suffering was preventable , a chain of similar disasters will take place as army action heats up in Waziristan and other parts of the country . 
The US administration is extremely concerned about the Taliban &apos;s advances in Pakistan . 
But the two have different sets of concerns - and herein lie their inherently different perceptions of the situation . 
The US media and government focus their rhetoric on the possibility of Pakistan &apos;s nuclear arsenal falling into Taliban hands . 
The other obvious Western concern - recently expressed by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown - is the threat of a &quot; crucible of terrorism &quot; in the border areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan endangering world security . 
Pakistanis , on the other hand , are the people actually living with that threat . 
The Taliban have brought violence and terror . 
Now the Taliban are blasting girls &quot; schools and flogging women . 
This is not Pakistan . 
Had it been Pakistan &apos;s ethos , the Taliban in Swat wouldn &apos;t have needed to blast schools - people would have happily pulled their daughters from the schools themselves . 
Ordinary men and women in Swat believe in education , but the Taliban were terrorizing them out of exercising their legal and constitutional rights . 
This illiterate , armed , Wahhabi brand of ideology was imported - as US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted recently before House Appropriations Committee - by the US from Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries in order to undermine the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980 &quot; s . 
Once the mission was accomplished and the Soviets vanquished , the Wahhabi virus was left to fester in Pakistan &apos;s border areas . 
In the eight years of General Pervez Musharraf &apos;s dictatorship , the US and Pakistan &apos;s army fought against the Taliban in Pakistan &apos;s tribal regions . 
Only occasionally was the fighting &quot; officially &quot; reported . 
Access to the area was denied to independent media . 
Many locally-based correspondents were killed in suspicious circumstances . 
There was a simple reason why Musharraf was the Western media &apos;s blue-eyed boy : he delivered . 
He and the Pakistani army delivered many of the Al Qaeda members most wanted by the US - Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , Egyptians , Yemenis , Saudis , and so on . 
For Pakistanis , however , Musharraf &apos;s martial rule emasculated civil liberties , pressured media whenever he disagreed with editorial content , massively increased the intelligence service &apos;s meddling in politics , and papered over the genuine grievances of disenfranchised people . 
Eight years and many billions of dollars later , the Pakistani Taliban seized control of the Swat region , terrorizing the adjoining district of Buner and raising alarm and consternation through the rest of Pakistan . 
Post-Musharraf Pakistan is a rather fragile democracy . 
Even today , the government &apos;s focus remains killing and bombing . 
There is no genuine attempt at politically mainstreaming the troubled areas , no understanding of what democracy entails . 
There is not even any money being spent on equipping hospitals in Peshawar and the rest of Pakistan with adequate blood banks and trauma units , despite the regular inflow of bombing victims . 
The Pakistani army would rather be seen as the country &apos;s savior than own up to its own shortsightedness and make clear whether it has decided to change course by obeying the constitution . 
Meanwhile , many worries and concerns remain : Will the internally displaced be able to return home and - despite the countless hastily dug graves that scar their beautiful landscape - reconnect with their old lives ? 
Will the political parties finally realize that they must stop looking to the US and start being more responsive to their own people ? 
But the most important questions are these : Will the face of the enemy become clear ?
