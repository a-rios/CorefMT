The Eclipse of British Reason 
BERLIN - When placed under too much strain , chains tend to break at the weakest link . 
Figuratively speaking , the same applies to the European Union . 
So the entire world quite naturally assumed that any process of EU disintegration would start primarily in the crisis-ridden European south ( Greece , first and foremost ) . 
But , as British Prime Minister David Cameron has now demonstrated , the European chain is most likely to break not at its weakest link , but at its most irrational . 
The United Kingdom - the homeland of pragmatism and realism , a country of unflappable principles and unmatched adaptability that stoically gave up its empire after successfully defending Europe &apos;s freedom against Nazi Germany - has now lost its way . 
More precisely , it has been led astray by the Conservative Party &apos;s ideological fantasy that certain EU powers can and should be returned to British sovereignty . 
The UK &apos;s national interests have not changed , and no fundamental shifts within the EU have worked against those interests . 
What has changed is Britain &apos;s domestic politics : a prime minister too weak to control his roughly 100 anti-European backbenchers ( call them the &quot; High Tea Party &quot; ) in the House of Commons , and a Conservative establishment wary of the UK Independence Party &apos;s rise , which could cost the Tories enough votes on the right to give Labour an electoral advantage . 
Cameron claims that he does not want the UK to leave the EU . 
But his strategy - &quot; renegotiation &quot; of EU membership , followed by a British referendum on the new agreement - is the product of two illusions : first , that he can ensure a positive outcome , and , second , that the EU is able and willing to give him the concessions that he wants . 
In fact , there is good reason to believe that such a course would take on a dynamic of its own , possibly leading to an unintended British exit from the EU . 
That would be a severe setback for the EU ; for the British , blundering through history , it would be a veritable disaster . 
While Britain surely would survive outside the EU , the quality of its existence is another matter . 
By exiting the EU , the UK would severely damage its economic interests , losing both the single market and London &apos;s role as a financial center . 
An exit would also harm Britain &apos;s geopolitical interests , both in Europe ( where , ironically , it favors EU enlargement ) and , worldwide , in its global standing and special relationship with the United States ( which has made clear its preference for a European UK ) . 
Unfortunately , Cameron &apos;s track record in European politics does not inspire confidence in his ability to manage a different outcome . 
When , in 2009 , he ordered the Conservative MEPs to withdraw from the European People &apos;s Party , the Europe-wide grouping of center-right political forces , he merely deprived the Tories - now consigned to sit with the sectarians and obscurantists - of any influence in the European Parliament . 
By weakening the UK &apos;s position within the EU , he ended up strengthening the Euro-skeptics within his party . 
But , while Cameron should know from grim experience what is looming , it seems that he has abandoned rational considerations . 
Indeed , the belief that the EU would renegotiate Britain &apos;s membership terms - which assumes , further , that Germany would not object - borders on magical thinking . 
Such a precedent would be applicable to the other member states , which would mean the end of the EU . 
With all due respect to the UK , dismantling the EU as the price of its continued membership is an absurd idea . 
Cameron should recognize that his strategy cannot be allowed ( even if he fears that a few cosmetic corrections to the treaty won &apos;t help him at home ) . 
In the meantime , the Tories risk losing their way on a crucial issue - reform of the relationship between the eurozone and non-euro EU members - if they try to use it as leverage to renegotiate the various European treaties . 
Britain knows that the euro &apos;s survival requires much closer political integration , and also that London &apos;s role as a financial center - as important for the UK as the nuclear industry is for France and the auto industry is for Germany - would be greatly damaged if the euro should fail . 
Although no one should expect the British to join the euro any time soon , political leadership within the EU requires the acumen to take account of the central interests of one &apos;s own country and those of the other member states without indulging in threats . 
This , however , requires an adequate understanding of those interests and a willingness to cooperate on the basis of mutual trust , which should be a given within the European family . 
Speeches , particularly when delivered by leaders of great nations , can be useful , irrelevant , or dangerous . 
Cameron &apos;s long-planned speech on Europe was postponed time and again . 
Perhaps he should have taken that as a sign that he should rethink his position . 
He still can , before it is too late . 
The best starting point would be a re-reading of Winston Churchill &apos;s famous speech in Zurich in 1946 . 
&quot; We must build a kind of United States of Europe , &quot; urged Britain &apos;s greatest twentieth-century statesman . 
That remains our task - and Britain &apos;s - to this day .
