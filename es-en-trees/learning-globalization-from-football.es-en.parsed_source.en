Learning Globalization From Football 
Football is not only the world &apos;s most popular sport , but also probably its most globalized profession . 
It is inconceivable that Brazilian , Cameroonian , or Japanese doctors , computer scientists , blue-collar workers , or bank tellers could move from one country to another as easily as Brazilian , Cameroonian , or Japanese football players do . 
Indeed , London &apos;s Arsenal football club is composed entirely of foreigners , including a French coach . 
Even the captain roles are no longer reserved for domestic players : Thierry Henry , a Frenchman , is Arsenal &apos;s captain , Andriy Shevchenko , a Ukrainian , is often the captain of AC Milan , and Christiano Zanetti , an Argentine , is captain of Inter Milan . 
Similarly , dozens of South Americans and Africans play in Russian , Turkish , Polish , and various Southeast European leagues . 
Football thus provides a glimpse of how true globalization of labor would work . 
In football , as in other occupations , restrictions on labor mobility came entirely from the demand side . 
No limits were ever imposed on players &quot; movements , except by Communist countries . 
But the demand side was heavily regulated , owing to a rule that clubs could field no more than two foreign players in any single game . 
The Bosman ruling , named after a Belgian player who successfully challenged the rule &apos;s application to players from other European Union countries , eroded the limit , which collapsed altogether under the onslaught of the richest European clubs &quot; demand for a free hand in hiring the best players , wherever they might be found . 
So wherever globalization and full commercialization reign supreme , there is an unmistakable concentration of quality and success . 
Consider the number of clubs that have qualified for the European Champions &quot; League top eight slots . 
If we look at five-year periods between 1967 and 1986 , the number of different teams that qualified for the quarterfinals varied between 28 and 30 . 
In the next two five-year periods , however , the number fell to 26 , and in the most recent period ( 2000-2004 ) , there were only 21 . 
The bottom line is simple : fewer and fewer clubs are making it into the European elite . 
National leagues are similar . 
Since the English Premier League was started in 1992 , only one championship was not won by Manchester United , Arsenal , or Chelsea . 
In Italy , all but two Serie A championships since 1991 have been won by either Juventus or AC Milan . 
In Spain , all but three championships since 1985 have been won by either Real Madrid or Barcelona . 
The reason for this concentration at the top is obvious : the richest clubs are now able to attract the best players in the world . 
Yet this has arguably been accompanied by improved quality in the game itself , owing to what economists call &quot; increasing returns to scale . &quot; 
When the best players play together , the quality of each , and of the team as a whole , increases exponentially . 
When Ronaldinho and Messi , or Kaka and Shevchenko , play together , their combined &quot; output &quot; ( number of goals ) is greater than the sum of goals that each would score if he played in a different club with less talented co-players . 
Free mobility of labor in other areas would probably produce the same effect . 
If doctors , computer specialists , or engineers ( let alone the proverbial Polish plumbers ! ) were allowed to move freely , the concentration of talent in the richest countries would most likely increase . 
Inequality in the distribution of talent across countries would rise , even if total world output of goods and services , and their average quality , improved , as with football today . 
Poorer or smaller countries can hardly dream of winning a European championship , as Steaua ( Romania ) , Red Star ( Serbia ) , or Nottingham Forest ( now languishing in the English third division ) once did . 
But , while we see inequality and exclusion in club-level football , the opposite is true for competitions between national teams . 
The average winning margin among the top eight World Cup national teams has steadily decreased , from more than two goals in the 1950 &quot; s , to about 1.5 goals in the 1960 &quot; s , 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s , and only 0.88 goals in the 2002 World Cup . 
The same is true of all games played at the final tournament , not only those among the top eight national teams . 
The decrease in winning margins is all the more impressive because the World Cup has grown from 16 to 32 national teams - many of them new and rather inexperienced . 
Remarkably , they are not trounced by the traditional powerhouses . 
On the contrary , the elite eight teams of the last four World Cups have included two &quot; newcomers &quot; that had never been quarterfinalists , such as Turkey and South Korea in 2002 . 
There are again two reasons for this . 
First , free movement has meant that good players from small leagues improve much more than they would had they stayed home . 
A good Danish or Bulgarian player improves much faster if he joins Manchester United or Barcelona . 
Second , that improvement in quality was &quot; captured &quot; by national teams thanks to FIFA &apos;s rule requiring players to play only for their national team . 
Eto &apos;o can play for any Spanish , Italian , or English club , but in the national competitions , he can play only for Cameroon . 
In other words , FIFA has introduced an institutional rule that allows small countries ( in the football sense ) to capture some of the benefits of today &apos;s higher-quality game , thereby partly reversing the &quot; leg drain . &quot; 
The same rule could be applied to other activities . 
Free movement of skilled labor could be accompanied by binding international requirements that migrants from poor countries spend , say , one year in five working in their countries of origin . 
They would bring home skills , technology , and connections that are as valuable as the skills that Eto &apos;o , Essien , or Messi bring back to Cameroon , Ghana , or Argentina . 
Job placement would remain a problem , but the principle is sound : the world should learn from its most popular sport .
